The doctor acknowledged this in [D-51] and [D-53], stating \"if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out.\" Second, the couple had limited outside contact: the patient works from home [P-23, P-42], they had been mainly staying together [P-22], with only a hiking trip the previous weekend as notable exposure [P-18]. She denied known sick contacts other than her husband [P-17]. This limited exposure supports household transmission rather than independent exposures. Third, the patient had not received a flu shot this year [P-53], which the doctor specifically asked about [D-53].

Second, the doctor recommended self-isolation for both the patient and her husband, instructing: \"I want to have you and your husband self isolate\" [D-53], reinforced in [D-54]: \"until we, I suppose rule out covid, it'd be best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious.\" Third, the doctor planned a physical examination as the next immediate step: \"what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam\" [D-52]. Fourth, the clinician indicated they would consult the supervising physician, stating \"I'm going to go talk to the Doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you\" [D-55], suggesting this encounter was conducted by a trainee or resident and that further assessment would follow after the attending physician's input. The patient agreed to the plan [P-54].",

Next, a sore throat developed, present around fever onset and still ongoing (\"it's just not going away\") [P-1]. The fever then appeared and had been present for three days at presentation [P-1], with the doctor summarizing the progression as stuffy nose leading to fever [D-3]. Concurrently with the fever, muscle aches appeared over the past two to three days [P-13, P-14], and the doctor confirmed this temporal overlap [D-15], with the patient agreeing [P-15, P-16]. Comparing timelines, her husband had been experiencing similar symptoms for the past week [P-19], meaning his illness began approximately four days before the patient's fever onset. His symptoms were described as similar and still ongoing [P-20].
