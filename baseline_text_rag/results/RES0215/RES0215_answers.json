    "question_type": "symptom_recall",
    "gold_answer": "At presentation, the mother reported three respiratory symptoms: her daughter has been \"quite wheezy\" for the past four to five days, sounds \"a little short of breath,\" and now has a \"slight cough\" [P-1]. She also described episodes where the child became \"quite out of breath\" with activity such as playing tag [P-3]. During episodes, the child \"slightly has a hard time catching her breath,\" though the mother denied cyanosis, stating \"it's not like she turns blue or anything like that\" [P-32]. When the doctor asked what was first noticed at onset [D-2], the mother identified wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths as the earliest symptoms [P-2]. The cough appeared more recently, as implied by the mother's phrasing \"and now she has a slight cough\" [P-1], suggesting it developed after the wheezing and breathlessness were already established. The cough was further characterized as non-productive, with the mother denying phlegm [P-31]. Despite these symptoms, the mother noted the child \"looks fine otherwise\" [P-9].",

    "gold_answer": "For the current wheezing and shortness-of-breath episodes, the mother confirmed she does not give her daughter anything; the episodes typically resolve on their own with rest [P-33, P-34].

    "gold_answer": "These combined findings most strongly suggest pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the context of an atopic predisposition. Multiple transcript findings support this. First, symptoms are exercise-triggered: the daughter became \"quite out of breath\" playing tag [P-3] and running in the backyard [P-41], with a recurring pattern during activity [P-6]. Second, symptoms are episodic and reversible, resolving spontaneously with rest -- \"when she rests then it goes away\" [P-6, P-33]. Third, cold weather worsens symptoms [P-38], a recognized asthma trigger. Fourth, episodes occur across multiple settings [P-38], arguing against a single environmental allergen. Fifth, the child has seasonal allergies [P-35] with OTC antihistamine use [P-36], supporting an atopic tendency associated with asthma. Sixth, a single nocturnal wheezy episode caused trouble falling asleep [P-43, P-44]. Seventh, pertinent negatives -- absence of fever [P-7], runny nose [P-8], sick contacts [P-10], and phlegm [P-31] -- argue against infectious etiologies and favor reactive airway disease.",

    "question_type": "risk_factors",
    "gold_answer": "These risk factors collectively form an atopic and environmental profile relevant to exercise-induced wheezing. Seasonal allergies [P-35] with OTC antihistamine use [P-36] indicate an atopic constitution, which is frequently associated with childhood asthma. Recurrent viral infections over the past two years [P-15], which did not require antibiotics [P-16], are notable because repeated viral respiratory infections can trigger airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in susceptible children. New carpets installed approximately six months ago [P-54] represent a potential indoor irritant source, though the mother did not report a direct temporal link to symptom onset. Cold weather sensitivity [P-38] is a recognized non-allergic trigger for bronchospasm in hyperreactive airways. The doctor also assessed other environmental factors: smoking in the household (denied, [P-53]), pets (denied, [P-55]), wood-burning stoves (denied, [P-56]), and air filter maintenance (confirmed, [P-57]). Together with exercise-triggering [P-3, P-41] and resolution with rest [P-6], these factors suggest a child with atopic predisposition whose airways have become hyperresponsive, manifesting primarily with exercise and cold air exposure.",

    "question_type": "clinical_plan",
    "gold_answer": "In [D-58], the doctor outlined three immediate next steps: first, performing a physical examination of the daughter; second, consulting with the supervising physician (\"I'm going to go talk to the physician\"); and third, returning to see the daughter and discuss the plan going forward (\"we'll talk about next steps from there\"). No specific tests, imaging, or medications were named in the transcript. The doctor also offered the mother an opportunity to raise questions before proceeding, which the mother declined [P-58]. Prior to formulating this plan, the doctor conducted a thorough assessment of home environmental factors relevant to respiratory symptoms: whether anyone smokes in the household (denied, [P-53]); presence of new carpets installed about six months ago [P-54]; presence of pets (denied, [P-55]); wood-burning fireplaces or stoves (denied, [P-56]); and whether air filters had been changed (confirmed, [P-57]). The doctor also established that the family lives in a townhouse [P-50] with the patient, her mother, and her father [P-49], providing context for exposure assessment.",

    "question": "How did the 8-year-old patient's respiratory symptoms develop and change from initial onset to the time of presentation, including the initial trigger, the fluctuating pattern of episodes, the emergence of cough, and the single nocturnal episode?",
    "question_type": "temporal_progression",
    "gold_answer": "The symptom progression began four to five days before presentation [P-1]. The initial trigger was physical activity: the daughter \"was playing tag with one of her cousins and she was quite out of breath after\" [P-3]. The earliest symptoms were wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths [P-2]. Following this initial episode, the symptoms demonstrated a fluctuating, episodic pattern [P-5]. The mother elaborated that her daughter would \"have these episodes, but it would resolve on its own and then she would go back to doing some sort of activity and then she would have all these symptoms all over again, but when she rests then it goes away\" [P-6]. A cough emerged more recently as an additional symptom; the mother's phrasing \"and now she has a slight cough\" [P-1] implies it developed after the wheezing and breathlessness were already established, and it was non-productive with no phlegm [P-31]. There was also a single nocturnal episode where the daughter had \"some issues with like wheeziness\" at night that resolved spontaneously but caused trouble falling asleep [P-43, P-44]. Pertinent negatives throughout this progression include no cyanosis [P-32], no fever [P-7], and the child appearing \"fine otherwise\" between attacks [P-9].",
