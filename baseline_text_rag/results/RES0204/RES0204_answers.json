    "question_type": "symptom_recall",
    "gold_answer": "The pediatric patient reported two respiratory symptoms. First, a cough present for approximately four to five days [P-2, P-4]. The doctor characterized it as a dry cough and the patient agreed [D-5, P-5]. It was explicitly non-productive: when asked whether he was bringing up any sputum or 'gunk,' the patient denied producing any material ('No, no, nothing like that') [D-6, P-6]. The cough severity had 'kind of stayed the same' since onset, neither worsening nor improving [D-7, P-7]. Second, the patient reported a runny nose for 'the past couple of days' [D-11, P-11], making it more recent than the cough. When asked about discharge quality (clear, watery, thick, or discolored), the patient described it as 'pretty clear' [D-12, P-12]. The patient noted he had never had a dry cough like this before and that past runny noses never lasted this long [P-24]. Pertinent negatives include denial of sore throat [P-9], chest pain [P-15], and the mother's report of no wheezing or shortness of breath even with physical activity [P-28].",

Second, a COVID-19 nasal swab: the specific rationale was institutional protocol, as the doctor stated 'we should probably do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately' [D-39], indicating standard screening for patients with respiratory symptoms rather than specific clinical suspicion unique to this patient. The doctor acknowledged the swab would be uncomfortable ('not a lot of fun') involving 'stick[ing] something up your nose,' but reassured the patient about bravery [D-39].

    "gold_answer": "The doctor outlined a structured multi-step plan. At the outset, the doctor explained the visit structure: they would chat to get an idea of how things were going, perform an examination of the lungs and heart, then consult with the supervising physician before returning with a plan [D-1]. Two diagnostic tests were proposed: first, a chest X-ray, as the supervising doctor 'might want to do a chest X Ray' to 'get a better look at what's going on there' [D-37]; second, a COVID-19 nasal swab, performed as standard protocol for patients presenting with respiratory symptoms [D-39]. The doctor explained both in age-appropriate language, describing the X-ray as 'like taking a picture of your body on the inside' and preparing the patient for the discomfort of the nasal swab while offering reassurance [D-39]. Regarding consultation, the doctor stated they would 'go get the doctor that I'm working with' [D-37], indicating they were a trainee under supervision. The follow-up plan was to 'arrange for these things' and return with the supervising physician to 'talk about where to go from here' [D-40]. The patient and mother acknowledged and agreed [P-40]. The doctor concluded by thanking the family [D-41, D-42].",

    "question_type": "temporal_progression",
    "gold_answer": "The patient's symptoms began with a dry cough approximately four to five days before the visit [P-2, P-4], making it the first and primary symptom. The cough was characterized as dry [D-5, P-5] and non-productive throughout, with no sputum or 'gunk' [D-6, P-6]. Regarding severity, the cough had 'kind of stayed the same' since onset [D-7, P-7], neither worsening nor improving, which contributed to seeking care as 'it doesn't seem to be going away or getting better' [P-2]. The runny nose developed later, present for only 'the past couple of days' [D-11, P-11], beginning roughly two to three days after the cough, with 'pretty clear' discharge [D-12, P-12]. This sequential onset indicates a progressive symptom pattern. Comparing to prior history, the patient stated he had been 'pretty healthy otherwise,' had 'never had like a dry cough like this' before, and while he had experienced runny noses previously, 'they never lasted this long' [P-24]. The mother confirmed no history of wheezing or shortness of breath during physical activity [P-28], further suggesting this progression represents a novel acute event for the patient.",
