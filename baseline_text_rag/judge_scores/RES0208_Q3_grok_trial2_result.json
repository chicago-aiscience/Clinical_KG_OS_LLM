  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer specifies 'fevers and fatigue and muscle aches' as evidence of general infectious process. Generated includes these correctly but adds 'difficulty breathing', which Gold (and transcript structure via 'and then') attributes to additional COVID-concerning symptoms. Additional symptoms in Gold: 'difficulty breathing' + 'sore throat and cough'; Generated correctly lists sore throat and cough but omits difficulty breathing from this category. This misattribution is a significant factual error/contradiction with Gold's parsing. Score: 2",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1. General infectious: fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (covered). 2. Additional for COVID: difficulty breathing + sore throat/cough (partially covered - sore throat/cough yes, difficulty breathing misplaced to general). 3. Structural explanation (infection 'with' first list, 'and then' others). 4. Loss of taste/smell elicited but not cited in assessment. 5. Respiratory focus for COVID, orders/swab. Covers core symptoms (~70%) but misses proper categorization, notes on taste/smell, full context. Score: 3",
    "faithfulness": "All listed symptoms (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) directly verifiable in D-36 and patient reports (e.g., P-1/3 SOB, P-4 fever/loss taste, P-20 aches, P-7/9 throat/cough). Citation to D-36 accurate. No hallucinations; grouping interpretive but grounded in transcript phrasing. Minor discrepancy in parsing 'with... and then...', but claims verifiable. Score: 4",
    "relevance": "Directly identifies and categorizes symptoms per question's two parts (general infectious evidence vs. additional for COVID not ruled out). Concise, focused, no tangents. Score: 5"

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is relevant and faithful to the transcript but reduces correctness and completeness due to misattributing 'difficulty breathing' to the general infectious process instead of COVID-specific concerns as parsed in the Gold Answer."
