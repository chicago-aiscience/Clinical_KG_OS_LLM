  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All statements in the Generated Answer align with the Gold Answer and transcript: the patient is not currently taking prescribed medications (P-23), previously took anxiety medication 2–3 years ago and stopped (P-24), and is managing reflux via dietary avoidance of triggers like acidic foods/chocolate (P-25). No incorrect additions or contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points about: (1) no current prescribed meds, (2) past anxiety medication stopped, and (3) reflux managed with diet. Misses: (a) hay fever noted with no treatment described, (b) cough-related treatment status—patient requested medication but none was prescribed/recommended in the transcript, and (c) explicit cross-condition summary that they are on zero medications across anxiety/reflux/hay fever/cough. Overall coverage is partial (~60–75%).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate references. No hallucinated treatments, diagnoses, or recommendations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question about current medication status and what they are doing for acid reflux, and whether they take prescribed meds. However, it does not fully address 'across all conditions' (e.g., hay fever and cough treatment status)."
