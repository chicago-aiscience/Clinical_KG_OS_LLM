{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the child sometimes takes OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications involved. These points are consistent with the Gold Answer/transcript (though the cited speaker/turn labels are incorrect). No incorrect medications or treatments are introduced.",
    "completeness": "It captures only part of the Gold Answer: (1) occasional Reactine/OTC antihistamines and (2) no prescribed medications. It omits other key details: that nothing is given for the current wheezing/SOB episodes (they resolve with rest), that she is on no regular medications currently aside from occasional Reactine, and that prior viral infections did not require antibiotics.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims themselves are supported by the transcript (seasonal allergies with occasional Reactine; no prescribed meds). However, the citations are inaccurate (they reference D-36/D-47 rather than the parent’s lines P-36/P-47), which reduces faithfulness somewhat even though the content is still verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The answer is on-topic (medications/treatments and whether prescribed meds are part of management), but it does not address treatment for the current respiratory episodes, which is explicitly part of the question."
