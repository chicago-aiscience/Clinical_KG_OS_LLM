  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All included recommendations match the Gold Answer and transcript: COVID swab with 24–48h turnaround, isolate for 14 days, isolate from younger sister specifically, and ER precautions for high temp/neuro symptoms/seizures/weakness/dizziness/fainting. No contradictory or incorrect statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Covers several key Gold Answer points (COVID test + turnaround, 14-day isolation, isolate from younger sister, ER/return precautions). Misses other Gold Answer elements: mention of possible false-negative swab, possibility of another circulating viral illness if negative, the explicitly supportive/observational approach (no meds; wait for swab), and the school’s requirement for a COVID test result to return. Overall ~50–79% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by D-44 (and consistent with household context). No added details beyond the transcript; no hallucinations detected.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what was asked: diagnostic test, isolation instructions with duration, and who specifically to isolate from, plus closely related management (ER red flags). No irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, well-grounded, and directly responsive, but omits several management nuances present in the Gold Answer (false negatives/alternate viral illness, supportive observation/no meds, and school testing requirement)."
