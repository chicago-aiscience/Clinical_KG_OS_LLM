  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer consists only of the incomplete fragment 'Based', providing no factual content whatsoever. It contains zero facts to compare against the Gold Answer's detailed listing of resolved symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, productive cough with whitish clear mucus, flu symptoms resolving in 3-4 days) and persistent symptoms (dry cough ~3-4 times/hour, spontaneous, stable intensity/frequency, chest soreness from coughing), along with pertinent negatives. Thus, it is entirely inconsistent by absence of any correct facts, warranting the lowest score.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer covers key points including persistent cough [P-2], resolved symptoms (sore throat [P-13], runny nose/flu symptoms [P-14], mucus for 4-5 days [P-6]), current dry cough details [P-5,P-6,P-7,P-8,P-9,P-10], chest soreness [P-15,P-16], and negatives [P-11,P-12,P-19,P-20]. The Generated Answer covers 0% of these key points, missing everything.",
    "faithfulness": "There are no claims in the Generated Answer to verify against the transcript, rendering it entirely ungrounded with no citations or reference to transcript content. The incomplete 'Based' introduces no hallucinated facts but also no verifiable information, effectively fabricating an empty response instead of grounded content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question about specific symptoms (resolved and current) during the two-week illness, offering no relevant content and completely failing to engage with the query."
