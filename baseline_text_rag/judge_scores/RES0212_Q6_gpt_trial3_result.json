  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects what is stated in D-47: the plan to “go review your story with the doctors,” and the partial summary that the cough has been present for a while and worsened over the last three days with nighttime waking. It does not introduce any statements that contradict the Gold Answer; it is mainly truncated/incomplete rather than incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) plan to review the story with the doctors. Partially covered: (2) summary assessment that cough has been present for a while and worsened in last three days with nighttime awakening. Key points missed: greenish sputum, no blood, explicit statement of no constitutional symptoms, the implication that next steps depend on supervising physician assessment, and the direct answer to what information would guide next steps (supervising physician’s assessment after reviewing the history). The response is also cut off mid-sentence.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (especially D-47). No clear hallucinated or extraneous clinical conclusions are added. The main issue is incompleteness rather than ungrounded content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is on-topic (plan and assessment) but fails to address the full question, especially the third component (what would guide next steps), and provides an incomplete assessment due to truncation."
