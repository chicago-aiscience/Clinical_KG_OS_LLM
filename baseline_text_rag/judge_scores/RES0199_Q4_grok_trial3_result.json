  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab as the test with 24-48 hour turnaround, and another viral illness as the alternative if negative, matching all facts in the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52] with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) rule out COVID-19 ✓, (2) swab test ✓, (3) 24-48 hours turnaround ✓, (4) alternative viral illness if negative ✓. Missed: isolation for 14 days, public health contact tracing if positive, supportive management either way (these are supplementary, not core to the question, covering ~80% of content).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-52]: 'rule out covid', 'take a swab... 24 to 48 hours', 'if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness'. Citations accurate, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses all elements of the question (condition, test+turnaround, alternative if negative) with no off-topic content."
