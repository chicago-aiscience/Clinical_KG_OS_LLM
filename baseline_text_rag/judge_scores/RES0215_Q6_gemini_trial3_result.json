  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer regarding the doctor's next steps and the mention of air filters as an environmental factor.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the core components of the doctor's plan (exam, consultation, and follow-up) but significantly lacks coverage of the environmental factors. It only mentions air filters, omitting smoking, carpets, pets, fireplaces, and household composition which are detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript, specifically referencing the assessment in D-57 and the plan outlined in D-58. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question's two main parts (the plan and the environment), though the environmental section is overly brief and misses several points."
