  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The facts provided in the generated answer regarding the doctor's plan to review the story with other doctors and the initial details of the cough assessment (duration, recent worsening, and nighttime awakening) are all factually correct and consistent with both the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The response is highly incomplete. It ends abruptly mid-sentence ('brings up'), failing to mention the sputum color, the absence of blood, or the absence of constitutional symptoms. Furthermore, it completely misses the third part of the question regarding what information would guide the next steps in care (the supervising physician's review).",
    "faithfulness": "The information that is present is entirely faithful to the transcript (specifically D-47) and contains no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant to the prompt but fails to address the final question and cuts off the summary assessment, significantly reducing its utility in answering the multi-part prompt."
