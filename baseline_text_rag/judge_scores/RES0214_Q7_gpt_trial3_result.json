  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer does not provide any substantive factual statements about the symptom sequence or timing (it stops mid-sentence). Therefore, it does not contradict the Gold Answer, but it also fails to state the key correct facts (stuffy nose → sore throat → fever 3 days → myalgias 2–3 days; husband symptomatic ~1 week). Given the absence of clinical content, correctness is limited/indeterminate rather than demonstrably accurate.",
    "completeness": "Misses essentially all required elements from the Gold Answer: (1) first symptom (stuffy nose), (2) subsequent sore throat and persistence, (3) fever onset and duration (3 days at presentation), (4) muscle aches and their overlap with fever (2–3 days), and (5) comparison to husband’s earlier onset (~1 week) and staggered timeline. No meaningful coverage of the requested chronological progression.",
    "faithfulness": "Contains no specific clinical claims beyond an unfinished lead-in (“Based on the transcript excerpts…”). There are no hallucinated details; what is present is consistent with grounding, though non-informative.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for a chronological symptom progression and comparison to the husband’s timeline. The generated answer begins to respond but provides no actual timeline or comparison, so it only minimally engages with the prompt."
