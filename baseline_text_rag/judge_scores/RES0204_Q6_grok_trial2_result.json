  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core elements of the doctor's plan (diagnostic tests including COVID swab and imaging/X-ray, consultation with supervising physician, and follow-up discussion) consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript citations (D-1, D-37, D-39, D-40), but has minor discrepancies: it vaguely describes the chest X-ray as 'picture of the inside of the body (imaging)' without specifying 'chest X-ray,' omits the physical examination of lungs and heart as part of the initial plan [D-1], and does not mention age-appropriate explanations or patient agreement.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic tests (COVID swab fully, chest X-ray partially/vaguely), consultation with supervising physician, follow-up steps to discuss next steps; missed: detailed visit structure (chat, listen to lungs/heart), specific 'chest X-ray' naming, age-appropriate explanations for tests, arranging tests explicitly, patient/mother acknowledgment, concluding thanks—covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: COVID swab [D-39], imaging (X-ray) [D-37, D-39], consultation [D-1, D-37, D-40], follow-up [D-1, D-40]; citations are accurate, no hallucinations or fabricated content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured around diagnostic tests, consultation, and follow-up steps, directly addressing the question with no irrelevant or off-topic content."
