  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated plan in D-37: (1) listen to the heart and lungs and do a quick physical exam, then (2) consult with the doctor they are working with, review what was discussed, and return to discuss next steps. No contradictions with the Gold Answer; wording is slightly compressed but not inaccurate.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core required elements asked in the question: specified exam components (heart/lung auscultation + quick physical exam) and the described process for determining next steps (consult supervising/working-with doctor, review discussion, return to patient). It omits ancillary details present in the Gold Answer (that this was foreshadowed in D-1, explicit patient agreement P-37, and the note that no diagnosis/meds were provided), but those are not strictly required by the question prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by D-37. The answer does not introduce diagnoses, treatments, or other unsupported specifics. Minor paraphrase (“review the patient's symptoms”) is consistent with “go over everything you talked about.”",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what was asked (end-of-consultation plan, exam components, and next-steps process) with no tangential content."
