  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All statements in the Generated Answer align with the Gold Answer and the transcript: COVID swab ordered; 14-day isolation; contact tracing only if positive; supportive care including hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, and Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches. No contradictory or incorrect details were added.",
    "completeness": "Included: COVID-19 swab test; 14-day isolation; contact tracing if positive; supportive care measures (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, antipyretics/Tylenol for fever, Tylenol or NSAIDs for aches).\nMissed from Gold Answer: expected test turnaround time (24–48 hours); explicit mention of alternative diagnosis if negative (another viral illness going around); the framing that management is supportive regardless of test result (implied but not stated); and the explicit note that no prescriptions were ordered beyond supportive measures.",
    "faithfulness": "All included elements are directly supported by [D-52]. No evident hallucinations or unsupported claims were introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question components (test ordered, isolation duration, contact-tracing condition, supportive care) with no tangential content."
