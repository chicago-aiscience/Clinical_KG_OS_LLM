  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The facts provided in the Generated Answer regarding diagnostic tests and self-isolation instructions are accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. However, the response is truncated.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. It misses the expected timeline for results (24-48 hours), the source of further instructions (public health nurse), and the criteria for deciding between hospital admission and discharge (based on test results). Additionally, the response ends mid-sentence.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript with no hallucinations. The citations provided (D-37, D-38) are correct.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question but fails to provide a 'complete' management plan as requested, omitting several specific sub-questions asked in the prompt."
