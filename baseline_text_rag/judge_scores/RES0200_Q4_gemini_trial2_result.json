{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis, the COVID swab as the test, and the 24-48 hour turnaround time.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer addresses all three specific components of the question (diagnosis, test, and turnaround time). It is slightly less complete than the Gold Answer as it omits the specific symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, chills) that the Gold Answer identifies as the basis for the overlap.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is directly supported by the transcript, specifically in section [D-52]. The citation of [D-53] is technically irrelevant but the content itself is entirely faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant and focuses strictly on answering the multi-part question without including tangential information."
