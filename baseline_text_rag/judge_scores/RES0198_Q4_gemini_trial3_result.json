  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19, the swab test, the 48-hour turnaround, and the isolation instructions. However, it contains a minor factual error in its citation: it attributes the patient's mention of COVID to [D-1], which is the doctor's opening question, rather than [P-1].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer, including the condition, test, time, and primary isolation instructions. It misses the secondary instruction regarding 'further instructions from public health' mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is mostly faithful to the transcript, but the citation of [D-1] for the patient's statement is inaccurate (hallucination of the speaker label/turn number).",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused and directly addresses all four parts of the question without irrelevant information."
