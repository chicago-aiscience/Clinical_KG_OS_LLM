  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately restates the doctor's plan from [D-58] as performing a physical exam, consulting the physician, returning to see the daughter, and discussing next steps, which matches the Gold Answer. It correctly notes the air filter question from [D-57] as part of the home environment assessment. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer or transcript; all stated facts are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: Plan (physical exam, consult physician, return/discuss next steps) - fully covered; no specific tests/meds - not explicitly stated but implied; offered questions/declined - missed; environmental factors (smoking [P-53], carpets [P-54], pets [P-55], wood-burning [P-56], air filters [P-57], townhouse [P-50], family [P-49]) - only air filters covered (1/7). Covers ~50-60% of key points (full plan, partial env).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable: air filters question at [D-57], plan details at [D-58]. Citations accurate. No hallucinated content or unverifiable details; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question: doctor's plan (fully) and home environmental factors assessed (partially via air filters). Concise, no irrelevant or off-topic content."
