  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Matches the Gold Answer on all points it mentions: patient tried OTC decongestants and felt they helped “a little bit” (P-10), and the clinician recommended an OTC product “like Tylenol Cold” (D-39). No contradictory or incorrect statements.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core items asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) prior medication = decongestants, (2) perceived effect = helped a little, (3) recommended OTC = Tylenol Cold. It does not include additional Gold Answer details about supportive care (e.g., hydration) and expected duration (“a few weeks”), though these are peripheral to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript (P-10, D-39). No added or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question (what was tried, how well it worked, and what OTC was recommended) with no tangential content."
