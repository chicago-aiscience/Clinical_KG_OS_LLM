  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the immediate next steps described in [D-58]: a physical exam, speaking with/consulting the physician, then returning to discuss next steps. It also correctly identifies that air filters were addressed (the clinician asked about changing air filters at [D-57], and the parent confirmed at [P-57]). No incorrect or contradictory claims relative to the Gold Answer are present; the main issue is omission rather than inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) physical exam, (2) consult/speak to the physician, (3) return to discuss next steps, (4) air filters assessed.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (a) offer for the parent to ask questions before proceeding ([D-58]/[P-58]); (b) explicit note that no tests/imaging/medications were named; (c) other home/environmental factors assessed—household smoking ([P-53]), carpets/new carpets ([P-54]), pets ([P-55]), wood-burning fireplace/stove ([P-56]); (d) exposure context that they live in a townhouse ([P-50]) and household composition ([P-49]). Overall, it captures the clinical plan but only a small fraction of the environmental assessment.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript ([D-57] and [D-58]). No hallucinated examinations, tests, treatments, or environmental exposures are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses both parts of the question (next steps plan and home environmental factors), though the environmental portion is substantially underdeveloped."
