    "correctness": "The Generated Answer begins correctly by identifying that the doctor suspects recurring asthma as the top differential and cardiac ischemia as less likely, which aligns with the Gold Answer's description of the assessment in D-35 and D-36. However, the answer is incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence after 'cardiac ischemia less likely (' and fails to provide any information about the three key components outlined in the Gold Answer: (1) physical examination plans, (2) initial treatment intervention with rescue puffers, and (3) contingency approach if the initial intervention fails. The factual content provided is accurate but represents only a small fraction of the complete answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions only the assessment (asthma at top of differential, cardiac less likely) but completely omits: the physical examination plan (lung auscultation), the initial treatment intervention (rescue puffers as therapeutic trial), the contingency plan (return to table if rescue inhalers don't help), the stepwise one-thing-at-a-time approach, and the consultation with the supervising physician. The answer appears truncated and unfinished.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The assessment of asthma as top differential is stated in D-35, and cardiac ischemia being lower on the differential is mentioned in D-36. However, since the answer is incomplete, there are no hallucinated facts present - just missing information. The answer is grounded in what it does state.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer begins to address the question by discussing the doctor's assessment, which is one component of what was asked. However, it fails to address most of the question's requirements: the physical examination components, the first-step treatment intervention, and the contingency approach. The incomplete nature means it only partially addresses the overall question about the doctor's assessment and clinical plan."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence after only addressing the doctor's differential diagnosis assessment. While the limited content provided is factually accurate and grounded in the transcript (mentioning asthma as top differential and cardiac causes as less likely), it fails to cover the vast majority of required information including physical examination plans, treatment intervention with rescue puffers, and contingency approaches. The answer covers less than 20% of the Gold Answer's key points, making it inadequate despite the accuracy of its fragmentary content."
