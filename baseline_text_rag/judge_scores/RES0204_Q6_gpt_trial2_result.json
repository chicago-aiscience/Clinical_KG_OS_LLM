  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the clinician planned (1) diagnostic testing with a COVID swab and (2) imaging, and that they would (3) consult/return with the supervising physician and (4) come back to discuss next steps. However, it does not explicitly name the imaging test as a chest X‑ray (as specified in the Gold Answer and transcript), instead describing it generically as “a picture of the inside of the body (imaging).” This is not clearly wrong but is less precise than the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Included: COVID swab; imaging (though not explicitly ‘chest X‑ray’); plan to return with supervising physician; plan to discuss next steps/“where to go from here.”\nMissing key Gold Answer elements: the initial planned in-visit exam/listening to lungs and heart; explicit identification of the chest X‑ray; the rationale/standard protocol framing for COVID swabbing; the age-appropriate explanation/reassurance about discomfort; the closing/thanks. Overall, it captures the core plan but omits several components and details.",
    "faithfulness": "The statements made are generally grounded in the transcript (COVID swab, X‑ray concept, returning with supervising doctor, discussing next steps). The main issue is citation specificity: the imaging claim is attributed to (D-39, D-40) whereas the chest X‑ray is raised at D-37 and the X‑ray explanation is at D-39. This is a minor attribution imprecision rather than a substantive hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the requested items (tests, supervising physician consultation, follow-up/next steps). It does not add irrelevant material."
