  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately states the missed Keppra dose due to birthday dinner disruption (P-24) and patient's recognition of causal link via direct quote from P-9, fully matching Gold Answer's facts on connection and evidence without errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: missed dose reason and timing implication (P-24), patient's causal attribution (P-9 quote); misses nuances like spontaneity context (D-9 response), rarity of seizures (P-9), and no clinician confirmation, covering ~80-90% of Gold points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from transcript: Keppra (P-23), miss reason (P-24), exact P-9 quote; citation accurate, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both question parts: connection via missed dose explanation, patient recognition evidence with quote; no off-topic content."
