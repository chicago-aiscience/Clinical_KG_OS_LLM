  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies specific OTC medications/supplements (Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer for pain; daily multivitamin routinely) and states they were not very effective. The Generated Answer states that the information is not found in the excerpts, which is factually incorrect because these details are explicitly present in the transcript (e.g., P-6 and P-25).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Tried Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer for chest pain; (2) these did not help much; (3) takes a multivitamin regularly; (4) no other meds/prescriptions; (5) optional context on stress management and smoking reduction. Generated Answer includes none of these.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer does not introduce hallucinated medications or supplements, but it makes an unsupported/incorrect claim that the information is absent from the provided excerpts, despite the transcript clearly containing it. This is not well-grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "It is superficially responsive to the question (by claiming the data are missing), but it does not actually address what OTC medications/supplements were taken or their effectiveness, which is what was asked."
