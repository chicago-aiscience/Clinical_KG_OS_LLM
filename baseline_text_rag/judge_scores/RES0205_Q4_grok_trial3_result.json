  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition, the COVID test as the method, and the timing as two weeks ago at symptom onset, matching the Gold Answer and transcript without any factual errors or contradictions. The workplace concerns (colleagues scared, desire to return without coughing) are factually correct per P-35 and P-36.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: condition (COVID-19), test (COVID test), timing (at onset, two weeks prior), coworkers scared [P-35], return to work without coughing [P-36]. Missed: explicit negative result phrasing, hospital clerk job [P-34], PPE use [P-17], staying home since test [P-36], medication desire linked to return [P-35]. Covers approximately 60% of Gold Answer details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: COVID test and negative ('I don't have it') [P-35], timing ('test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago') [P-36], scared colleagues ('everyone's like scared at work when I cough') [P-35], return without coughing ('get back, and I don't want to be coughing when I get back') [P-36]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by specifying condition, test, timing relative to onset, and workplace concerns (scared colleagues, return to work), with no off-topic content."
