  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication (matching Gold [P-23]) and accurately describes the circumstance of missing the dose due to the daughter's birthday celebration disrupting the usual dinner routine (matching Gold [P-24]). It does not contradict any facts in the Gold Answer, though it omits explicitly linking it to epilepsy; however, core facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: Keppra prescription [P-23], daughter's birthday celebration as circumstance [P-24], usual timing with dinner disrupted. Missed: explicit mention of 'chronic epilepsy' [P-8, P-22], reference to forgetting in P-9, link to seizure, doctor's acknowledgment [D-24, D-25]. Covers core answer (med and circumstance) but ~80-90% of Gold's elaborated points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Keppra in [P-23]; birthday celebration, earlier event, no later dinner, forgetting dose in [P-24]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by stating the medication (Keppra) for the chronic condition (implied epilepsy) and the exact circumstance (birthday celebration changing dinner routine), with no off-topic content."
