  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient is not taking any prescribed medications (matching Gold [P-23]), previously took medication for anxiety 2-3 years ago (matching [P-24]), and manages acid reflux via dietary avoidance of trigger foods like acidic foods and chocolates (matching [P-25]). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: no current prescribed meds [P-23], past anxiety medication [P-24], acid reflux managed by diet only [P-25], no meds for reflux. Missed: explicit mention of hay fever/allergies [P-27] with no treatment described, cough details including patient request for meds [P-35] and no prescription yet [D-37], summary of zero meds across all conditions (anxiety, reflux, hay fever, cough). Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-23, P-24, P-25); no hallucinated facts or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses current medication status (none), past anxiety meds, and acid reflux management as specified in question; however, does not fully cover 'all conditions' by omitting hay fever and cough treatment status, making it mostly but not perfectly focused."
