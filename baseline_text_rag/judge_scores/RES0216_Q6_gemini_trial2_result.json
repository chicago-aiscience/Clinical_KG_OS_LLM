  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the doctor's assessment (asthma vs. cardiac ischemia) as per the Gold Answer, though the text ends in a truncated sentence.",
    "completeness": "The answer is extremely incomplete. It fails to provide any details on the physical examination (listening to lungs), the proposed treatment (rescue puffers), the contingency approach (returning to the table/stepwise approach), or the consultation with the supervising physician. It covers less than 20% of the required points.",
    "faithfulness": "The brief information provided regarding the differential diagnosis is faithful to the transcript (D-35, D-36).",
    "relevance": "The response is not relevant as an answer to the prompt because it is a fragment that fails to address the specific multi-part question regarding the clinical plan."
