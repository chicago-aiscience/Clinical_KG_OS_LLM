  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "What is present is mostly consistent with the transcript: asthma diagnosed at age 8 and baseline bronchodilator use about once every two weeks are correct. However, it incorrectly frames the current symptom duration as “past week” without incorporating the later clarification of “last two weeks,” which is central to the question’s timeline. It also cites diagnosis as (D-2, D-3) even though the diagnosis age is stated by the patient at P-2. The answer is truncated and does not state the current bronchodilator frequency (5–6 times/week), so the evolution is not accurately completed.",
    "completeness": "Key gold-answer elements missing include: (1) explicit current bronchodilator escalation to near-daily 5–6 times/week, (2) comparison that wheezing occurs even more often than bronchodilator use and the patient uses it only when very hard to breathe, (3) nighttime symptoms every other day/every two days, (4) triggers/seasonality (exercise, cold air, winter/spring), (5) no infectious precipitant identified, and (6) explicit statement of the two-year history (now age 10). Only diagnosis age, baseline use, and partial current symptoms are included before truncation.",
    "faithfulness": "The included claims (diagnosed at 8; baseline use once every two weeks; near-nonstop cough; shortness of breath) are supported by the transcript, though the timeframe is imprecise (week vs clarified two weeks) and at least one citation is inaccurate. No clear hallucinated facts are introduced; the main issue is omission/truncation rather than fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer is on-topic (asthma symptom and bronchodilator-use evolution) but fails to fully address the full temporal progression asked (baseline → current 2-week exacerbation with 5–6x/week use), largely due to being incomplete/truncated."
