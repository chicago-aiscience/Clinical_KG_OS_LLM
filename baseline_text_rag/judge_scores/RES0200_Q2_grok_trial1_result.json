  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory inhalers (Ventolin/Ventilin and Spiriva) as per P-11, accurately reports Ventolin usage as almost 10 times in the past week from P-12, and correctly states the patient discontinued a diuretic (blood pressure medication) on their own without doctor's approval from P-35 and P-36. All stated facts match the Gold Answer with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Ventolin (as needed), 2) Spiriva, 3) Ventolin used ~10 times past week, 4) atorvastatin (Torva Staten) for cholesterol, 5) previously prescribed diuretic discontinued on own without approval. Generated covers 1-3 and 5, misses 4 (atorvastatin). Covers approximately 80% but since atorvastatin is a explicit non-respiratory drug currently taken, it's a notable gap; assessed as 50-79%.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript: inhalers named in P-11 (in response to D-11), Ventolin use in P-12 (in response to D-12), discontinuation in P-35/P-36 (in response to D-35/D-36). No hallucinations. Citations point to the doctor's prompting lines rather than patient's responses, which are minor inaccuracies but claims remain verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question: lists respiratory inhalers taken prior, specifies Ventolin frequency in past week, identifies the discontinued medication (diuretic) without doctor's approval; includes no off-topic or irrelevant content."
