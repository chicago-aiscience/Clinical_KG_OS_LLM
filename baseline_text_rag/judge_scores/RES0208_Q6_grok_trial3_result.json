  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: chest X-ray and COVID swab correctly cited from D-37; physical exam planned from D-38/D-37; self-isolation instructions match verbatim from D-37 (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate). No factual errors or contradictions, though truncated.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Physical exam including chest (covered partially as 'physical exam'); 2) Chest X-ray for chest infection and COVID swab (fully covered); 3) Self-isolation specifics (stay away from everyone incl. wife, self-isolate max - partially covered, truncated); 4) Timeline 24-48 hours (missed); 5) Public health nurse contact if positive (missed); 6) Disposition based on results, no thresholds (missed); 7) From doctor D-37/38 (implied via citation). Covers ~50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: tests and self-isolation from D-37; PE from D-38. Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; truncation does not introduce fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured with bullets directly matching question elements (tests, PE, self-isolation); no irrelevant content, fully focused despite incompleteness."
