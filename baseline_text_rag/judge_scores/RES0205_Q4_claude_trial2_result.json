  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition, the COVID test as the specific test, and the timing as two weeks ago at symptom onset. It also correctly identifies that colleagues are scared when the patient coughs. However, it misses important workplace-related details present in the Gold Answer, such as the patient being a hospital clerk (P-34), wearing PPE consistently (P-17), and staying home since the test. These omissions represent minor but notable gaps in factual completeness.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the core elements: condition ruled out (COVID-19), test type (COVID test), timing (two weeks ago at symptom onset), and basic workplace concerns (colleagues being scared). However, it omits several key contextual details from the Gold Answer: (1) the patient's specific role as a hospital clerk, (2) the heightened infection control environment of a hospital, (3) the patient wearing PPE consistently, (4) the patient staying home since testing, and (5) the desire for medication to facilitate return to work. Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The COVID test is mentioned in P-35, the timing in P-36, and the workplace concern about colleagues being scared in P-35. The answer does not include any hallucinated information or claims not supported by the transcript. Citations align with the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all four components of the question: the condition ruled out, the specific test, timing, and workplace concerns. While brief, it stays focused on the question without including irrelevant information. The content is appropriate and on-topic throughout."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core facts: COVID-19 was ruled out via a COVID test performed at symptom onset two weeks prior, and colleagues are scared when the patient coughs. All stated facts are accurate and grounded in the transcript with perfect faithfulness. However, completeness is reduced by omitting important contextual details about the hospital work environment, PPE usage, staying home since testing, and the desire for medication to facilitate return to work. The answer is highly relevant and factually sound but lacks the comprehensive detail of the Gold Answer."
