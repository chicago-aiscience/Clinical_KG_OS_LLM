  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states the duration (~1 week) and that congestion/stuffiness came first with a shift to predominantly runny nose later in the week, which matches [P-2, P-3]. However, it is factually incorrect in stating that information about whether symptoms were constant vs intermittent was not found and that the patient did not answer—because the patient explicitly said symptoms had been “pretty constant for the past week” [P-8]. It also cites incorrect speaker/line references (e.g., duration attributed to D-1/D-2 rather than P-1/P-2, and symptom progression attributed to D-3/D-4 rather than P-3).",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) ~1 week duration; (2) stuffiness first; (3) shift to mostly runny. Misses: (1) the initial description of “on and off” followed by clarification of “pretty constant” (key part of the question and gold); (2) that symptoms were not improving prompting visit; (3) optional/contextual point from gold about possible decongestant influence. Overall, it captures only part of the requested chronological progression and omits the constant/intermittent evolution.",
    "faithfulness": "The statement that the patient did not answer the constant-vs-intermittent question contradicts the transcript (the patient answers at [P-8]). Several citations are inaccurate (referencing doctor lines instead of patient responses). These issues indicate unfaithfulness to the provided transcript despite some correct high-level content.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the nasal symptom timeline (onset, first symptom, change over the week, constant vs intermittent). There are no major tangents; however, it fails to provide the correct constant/intermittent detail that is central to the question."
