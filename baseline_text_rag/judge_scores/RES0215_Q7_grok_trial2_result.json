  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer consists only of an introductory phrase with no factual content about symptom onset, trigger, pattern, cough, or nocturnal episode, while the Gold Answer provides detailed, specific facts (e.g., 4-5 days onset [P-1], trigger playing tag [P-3], wheezing/SOB [P-2], fluctuating episodes resolving with rest [P-5,P-6], recent cough [P-1,P-31], single nocturnal wheeze [P-43,P-44]); thus, it contains no facts to compare for accuracy and effectively contradicts the expectation of a complete answer by omission.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: 1) Onset 4-5 days ago [P-1]; 2) Initial trigger: playing tag, out of breath [P-3]; 3) Initial symptoms: wheezing, difficulty deep breaths [P-2]; 4) Fluctuating episodic pattern, resolves with rest, recurs with activity [P-5,P-6]; 5) Recent emergence of slight, non-productive cough [P-1,P-31]; 6) Single nocturnal wheezy episode, trouble falling asleep, self-resolved [P-43,P-44]; 7) Pertinent negatives (no cyanosis [P-32], fever [P-7], looks fine otherwise [P-9]). Generated Answer covers 0% of these key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The single phrase 'Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient's respiratory symptoms developed as follows' is verifiable as the source is a transcript, contains no unsubstantiated claims or hallucinations, and makes no further assertions that could be checked against the transcript; however, it lacks any substantive content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer starts with a phrase directly referencing symptom development, indicating intent to address the question on respiratory symptom progression, trigger, pattern, cough, and nocturnal episode, but provides no actual content or answer, making it largely off-topic in practice."
