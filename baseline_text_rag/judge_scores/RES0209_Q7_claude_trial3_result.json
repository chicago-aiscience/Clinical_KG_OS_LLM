  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains factually correct information that aligns with the Gold Answer - diagnosis at age 8, baseline bronchodilator use once every two weeks, and current exacerbation with near-daily use. However, it contains an error stating 'past week' when the patient clarified 'last two weeks' (P-13). The answer also appears incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only basic timeline elements (diagnosis age, baseline usage, current symptoms) but omits critical details present in the Gold Answer: patient's current age (10), specific frequency of current bronchodilator use (5-6 times per week), triggers (exercise, cold air), seasonal patterns, wheezing frequency exceeding bronchodilator use, nighttime symptoms, chest tightness, and absence of infectious precipitants. Covers approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the transcript with appropriate citation style (D-2, D-3, P-8). The factual claims about diagnosis age, baseline usage frequency, and current symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) are all verifiable in the source material. No hallucinated content detected, though the answer is incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's three-part temporal evolution (diagnosis, baseline, current exacerbation) but provides insufficient detail for each phase. It stays on topic throughout but lacks the depth needed for a complete response to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a partially correct but incomplete response. It accurately identifies key temporal markers (age 8 diagnosis, baseline biweekly usage) and acknowledges the current exacerbation, but contains a minor timing error (stating 'past week' instead of 'two weeks'). The answer is notably incomplete, appearing to cut off mid-sentence, resulting in missing approximately 60-70% of important clinical details including specific current usage frequency, comprehensive symptom description, triggers, and nighttime manifestations. While factually grounded in the transcript, the response lacks the completeness needed for thorough clinical documentation."
