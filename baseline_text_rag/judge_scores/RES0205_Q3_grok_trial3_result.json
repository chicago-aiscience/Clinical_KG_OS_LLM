  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and the negative test result, which aligns with the Gold Answer. It mentions the patient as a hospital worker and persistent cough causing alarm among colleagues, which are factual and consistent with both the transcript and Gold Answer. However, there are minor discrepancies: incorrect citations (attributes patient statements in P-34 and P-35 to D-35), and it omits nuances like PPE use and test timing, but core facts are accurate without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Diagnosis: COVID-19 (covered); (2) Patient disclosed test [P-35] (implied); (3) Hospital exposure [P-34, P-17] (partially covered as hospital worker); (4) Flu-like symptoms [P-13, P-14] (missed); (5) Persistent cough concern (covered); (6) Coworkers scared [P-35] (covered); (7) PPE/careful [P-17] (missed); (8) Test timing [P-36] (missed); (9) Stayed home [P-36] (missed); (10) Negative result (covered). Covers diagnosis, partial evidence (hospital, cough alarm), and result—approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript: COVID-19 test and negative result [P-35], hospital worker [P-34 confirmed in D-35], persistent cough alarming colleagues [P-35]. No hallucinations, but citations inaccurately attribute to D-35 (doctor's response) instead of patient's statements (P-34, P-35), which is a minor citation error but content is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly structures its response around the three parts of the question (diagnosis, evidence, testing result) with no off-topic content, perfectly addressing the query."
