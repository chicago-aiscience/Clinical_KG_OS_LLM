  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the core details of the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the condition as COVID-19, the test as a COVID swab, and the social contact detail regarding the sick friend during dog walks.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary requirements of the question (condition, test, and the prompting contact). However, compared to the Gold Answer, it omits several details: the specific nuance about feeling 'falsely safe' outdoors, the uncertainty regarding the friend's test status, and the extensive list of negative screening symptoms (taste/smell/confusion/travel) that the Gold Answer includes as part of the doctor's diagnostic process.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript. The references [D-43] and [P-20] are accurate to the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and concise, focusing directly on the three specific components of the question without unnecessary fluff."
