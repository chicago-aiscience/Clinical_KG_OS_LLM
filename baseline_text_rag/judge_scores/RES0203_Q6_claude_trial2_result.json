  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence after 'Based on the transcript excerpts, the doctor assessed'. This makes it impossible to verify any factual claims against the Gold Answer. No complete information is provided about the assessment, diagnostic tests, self-care instructions, timeline, additional tests, or consultation plan that are all present in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the required key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) the assessment that symptoms were consistent with COVID, (2) the COVID swab test ordered, (3) self-isolation instructions, (4) the 1-2 day timeline for results, (5) potential additional tests, or (6) the plan to consult with a supervising physician. The answer is essentially empty.",
    "faithfulness": "Cannot properly evaluate faithfulness since the Generated Answer provides no substantive content. The incomplete sentence 'Based on the transcript excerpts, the doctor assessed' doesn't make any verifiable or unverifiable claims. There is no hallucination, but also no actual content to ground in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all due to being incomplete. The question explicitly asked for diagnostic tests, self-care instructions, timeline for results, additional tests/follow-up, and consultation plans - none of which are provided in the truncated response."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is completely incomplete, cutting off after only 8 words ('Based on the transcript excerpts, the doctor assessed'). It provides zero information about the doctor's assessment, management plan, diagnostic tests, self-care instructions, timelines, or consultation plans that were explicitly requested in the question and thoroughly covered in the Gold Answer. This represents a total failure to answer the question."
