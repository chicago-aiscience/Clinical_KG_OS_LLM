  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The statements included are consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer: hiking Friday and gardening Saturday before noticing soreness behind the knee and finding/removing the tick and bringing it in a plastic container (P-1). The comparison that the current tick was less engorged/smaller than the prior one aligns with P-3/P-4 and the clinician’s “grape” engorgement description (D-4). No explicit incorrect claims are made; the main issue is omission/truncation rather than factual error.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: \n- Friday hiking and Saturday gardening exposure; soreness behind left knee leading to discovery; brought tick in a plastic container.\n- Current tick less engorged/smaller than prior.\n\nKey points missed: \n- Patient’s uncertainty about when she acquired the tick and hope it was from hiking vs gardening (P-1).\n- That she noticed/removed it “earlier today” (D-1/P-1).\n- Doctor’s estimate that attachment could be >72 hours (D-6).\n- Prior episode details: bullseye/target rash and antibiotic treatment (P-3).\n- Current local symptoms contrast: localized redness/tenderness without the larger bullseye rash (P-6).\n- Generated answer’s “Symptoms” section is cut off and does not provide the needed comparison.\n\nOverall, it captures only a minority of the required timeline and comparison elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All included content is directly supported by the transcript (primarily P-1, P-3, D-4). There are no clear hallucinated details; however, the answer is incomplete/truncated rather than ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "What is provided stays on-topic (timeline of exposure and comparison to prior bite), but it does not fully address the question due to missing major requested elements (prior bullseye rash/antibiotics; current symptom comparison; clinician’s timing estimate)."
