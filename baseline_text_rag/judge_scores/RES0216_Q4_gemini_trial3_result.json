  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemic pictures) and accurately reflects the reasons provided by the doctor in the transcript (tightness vs. pain, lack of exertional dyspnea).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main points cited by the doctor in the concluding summary (D-36). However, it misses the specific 'red flag' symptoms (anxiety, sweating, impending doom) that the Gold Answer includes as absent symptoms contributing to the deprioritization of the condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript, specifically drawing from D-36 and P-1/P-5.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: identifying the condition and the symptoms used as evidence."
