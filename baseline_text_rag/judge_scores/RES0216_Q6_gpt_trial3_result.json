  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "What the Generated Answer does state (asthma recurrence as top differential; cardiac ischemia less likely) aligns with D-35 and D-36 and is not contradicted by the Gold Answer. However, the answer is visibly truncated (ends mid-sentence) and does not present the full plan; this lack of a complete, coherent statement slightly undermines overall factual adequacy compared with the full Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) asthma recurrence top differential pending exam; (2) quick physical exam planned; (3) specifically lung auscultation; (4) consider further investigations based on findings; (5) first-step therapeutic trial with rescue puffer during walks (patient lacks one); (6) contingency: if not improved, reassess and explore other directions/investigations; (7) stepwise/one-thing-at-a-time reassessment approach; (8) will discuss with supervising physician and return.\n\nGenerated Answer covers only: (1) asthma recurrence likely/top differential; and partially adds (cardiac ischemia less likely). It misses essentially all requested plan elements (physical exam components, first-step intervention, and contingency plan), so coverage is low (~25-30% of key items).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript (D-35: asthma recurrence on top of differential; D-36: cardiac ischemia lower on differential). No additional unsupported details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The content provided is on-topic (assessment of likely cause), but it does not address most of what the question asks for (physical exam components, initial treatment step, and contingency plan). Thus it is only partially responsive despite being focused."
