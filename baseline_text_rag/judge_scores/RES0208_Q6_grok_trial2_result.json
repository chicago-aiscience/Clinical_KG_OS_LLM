  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab) matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-37]. The physical examination is correctly noted as planned [D-38], consistent with Gold. Self-isolation instructions are factually correct where provided (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate), aligning with [D-37]. No factual errors or contradictions; minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'COVID swab' vs 'COVID-19 swab') do not impact core accuracy. All facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: physical exam (chest-focused), diagnostic tests (chest X-ray for infection, COVID-19 swab), self-isolation specifics (from doctor: stay away from everyone incl. wife, self-isolate maximally), timeline (24-48 hours), public health nurse follow-up if positive, disposition criteria (based on test results, no thresholds). Generated covers tests fully, physical exam briefly, self-isolation partially (cuts off mid-sentence). Misses timeline, public health nurse, disposition criteria, purposes/details, and explicit source (doctor). Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in transcript: tests and self-isolation/self-isolate instructions from [D-37], physical exam from [D-38]. Citations accurate. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; content is verbatim or paraphrased faithfully.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured with bullets directly addressing management plan elements (tests, exam, self-isolation) from the question. No off-topic content or tangents; perfectly focused despite being cut off."
