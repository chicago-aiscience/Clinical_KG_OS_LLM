  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects what is stated in the transcript where it does respond: the plan to “go review your story with the doctors” is correct (D-47), and the partial assessment that the cough has been present for a while and worsened in the last three days with nocturnal waking is consistent with D-47/P-20-21. However, the assessment is cut off mid-sentence (“brings up…”) and does not include key qualifying details from D-47 (greenish sputum, no blood, no constitutional symptoms). No explicit incorrect claims are made, but the truncated assessment limits verification of full accuracy.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer contains three required elements: (1) plan (review with supervising doctors), (2) summary assessment (3-month cough, worse 3 days, nocturnal waking, green sputum, no blood, no constitutional symptoms), and (3) what would guide next steps (supervising physician’s assessment; no specific tests/treatments ordered). The Generated Answer covers (1) fully, covers (2) only partially (misses green sputum/no blood/no constitutional symptoms), and does not address (3) at all. Overall coverage is well under 50% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All content present in the Generated Answer is grounded in D-47. It does not introduce unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments. The main issue is omission/truncation rather than hallucination.",
    "relevance": "What is provided is directly relevant to the question (plan and assessment). However, it does not answer the full question because it omits what would guide next steps and leaves the assessment incomplete due to truncation."

  "summary": "The answer is accurate and transcript-grounded for the limited points it includes, but it is truncated and misses major required elements—especially the absence of constitutional symptoms and what would guide next steps—resulting in low completeness."
