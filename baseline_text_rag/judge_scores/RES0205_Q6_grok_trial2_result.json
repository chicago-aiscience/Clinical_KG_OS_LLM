  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer and transcript: specific physical exam components (listening to heart and lungs, quick physical exam) from D-37, and the process (consult with supervising doctor, review discussion, return to discuss next steps). No factual errors or contradictions; minor rephrasing of 'everything talked about' to 'patient's symptoms' is consistent and not inaccurate.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: physical exam components (heart/lungs auscultation and quick exam), consultation with supervising doctor, review of patient's information, return to discuss next steps (80-99% coverage). Missed: explicit multi-step framing, foreshadowing in D-1, patient agreement in P-37, note on no diagnosis/meds provided.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in D-37 of the transcript (listen to heart/lungs, quick physical exam, go get doctor working with, go over everything talked about, come back to talk about next steps). Citation accurate; 'review the patient's symptoms' is a faithful paraphrase of 'go over everything you talked about'; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and concisely addresses the question by detailing the stated plan at the end (D-37), specified exam components, and the described process for next steps, with no off-topic content."
