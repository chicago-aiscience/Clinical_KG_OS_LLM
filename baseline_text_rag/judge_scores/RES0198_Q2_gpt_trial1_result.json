  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all elements directly asked: the patient tried OTC decongestants and felt they helped “a little bit” (P-10), and the doctor recommended an OTC option “like Tylenol Cold” for symptom relief (D-39). No contradictions or factual errors relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It includes the key items needed for the question (decongestants tried, partial effectiveness, Tylenol Cold recommendation). However, it omits additional supportive-care recommendations and counseling included in the Gold Answer (e.g., hydration and expectation of a few weeks for symptom resolution).",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript (P-10 and D-39). No invented medications or effects are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays tightly focused on the question (prior medication, perceived effectiveness, and recommended OTC treatment) without tangents."
