  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the duration (one week), the initial symptom (stuffy nose), and the shift to rhinorrhea (runny nose). However, it contains a significant factual error by stating that the patient did not answer the question regarding whether symptoms were constant or intermittent. In the transcript [P-8], the patient explicitly states the symptoms have been 'pretty constant for the past week'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the chronological progression and the first symptom. It fails to cover the 'constant vs. intermittent' aspect of the prompt, claiming the information is missing. It also omits the detail from the Gold Answer regarding how over-the-counter medications may have influenced the symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a negative hallucination by claiming the patient did not answer the doctor's question in [D-8]. The answer is clearly provided in [P-8] of the transcript. Additionally, it incorrectly attributes patient statements to the doctor's turn labels (D-1, D-2 instead of P-1, P-2).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant as it attempts to address all parts of the question, although it fails to successfully retrieve the information for the final part of the query."
