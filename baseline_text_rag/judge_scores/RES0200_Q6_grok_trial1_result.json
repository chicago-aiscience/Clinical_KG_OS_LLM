  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab), imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (oxygen saturation), and one therapeutic intervention (supplemental oxygen) as stated in [D-52], with no factual errors or contradictions compared to the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: all labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs, COVID swab), chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring, supplemental oxygen. Missed: continuation of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics (explicitly required in question and Gold), and blood pressure monitoring ([D-37]). Covers approximately 60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript [D-52] with accurate citations (e.g., exact phrasing for labs, imaging, O2 sat, supplemental O2); no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly matching the question's requested categories (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics) with no off-topic content, perfectly focused on the doctor's plan despite incompleteness."
