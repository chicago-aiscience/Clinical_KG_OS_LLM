  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding the respiratory inhalers (Ventolin, Spiriva), the frequency of Ventolin use (10 times), and the discontinuation of the blood pressure medication (diuretic). However, it misses the patient's current non-respiratory medication, Atorvastatin (Torva Staten), which was mentioned in [P-38] and specifically requested by the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers most key points: the two inhalers, the specific frequency of Ventolin use, the identification of the discontinued medication, and the fact that it was stopped without approval. It fails to include Atorvastatin, meaning it misses one of the currently taken non-respiratory drugs requested (approx. 83% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the transcript. However, the citations provided ([D-11], [D-12], [D-35], [D-36]) refer to the doctor's questions/prompts rather than the patient's turns ([P-11], [P-12], [P-35], [P-36]) where the information was actually disclosed. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the prompt: current medications, frequency of Ventolin use, and the discontinued medication. It is highly relevant and concise."
