  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding the timeline (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening) and the engorgement comparison (current tick is smaller/less engorged than the one from 10 years ago). No incorrect information was provided.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. It fails to complete the comparison of symptoms, ending mid-sentence ('The current bite is'). It misses the comparison of the bullseye rash from 10 years ago vs. the current localized tenderness, the mention of antibiotic treatment 10 years ago, and the doctor's specific estimate of the tick being attached for over 72 hours.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is directly grounded in the source transcript and uses the correct speaker citations (P-1, P-3, D-4). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant to the question asked, but because it is truncated, it fails to fulfill the second half of the prompt's requirements regarding the comparison of local symptoms."
