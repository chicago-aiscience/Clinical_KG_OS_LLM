  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main contributors described in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose due to disrupted routine) and (2) hereditary risk (maternal history of epilepsy). It accurately states that the mother had epilepsy and that the missed dose likely precipitated the seizure. Minor issue: it cites the epilepsy diagnosis as [P-9], whereas the explicit statement of epilepsy/seizure disorder is in [P-8] (though the diagnosis itself is still true and supported elsewhere in the transcript).",
    "completeness": "Covers the core Gold Answer points: missed Keppra dose and maternal epilepsy history. It does not include two secondary but relevant Gold Answer elements: the patient’s own statement that missing the medication likely triggered the seizure (direct quote/attribution from [P-9]) and the note that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent ([P-9]). Overall, it captures most key content but not all supporting/contextual points.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements are grounded in the transcript: Keppra use and missed dose due to daughter’s birthday are supported by [P-23] and [P-24]; family history (mother) is supported by [P-26]. The only concern is the specific citation for epilepsy diagnosis ([P-9] rather than [P-8]); this is a citation mismatch rather than a fabricated claim.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by naming both hereditary and medication-related risk factors and explicitly linking family history (mother) to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis. No irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The answer is largely accurate and on-point, identifying the key hereditary (maternal epilepsy) and medication-related (missed Keppra dose) factors, but it omits some supportive details and has a minor citation mismatch."
