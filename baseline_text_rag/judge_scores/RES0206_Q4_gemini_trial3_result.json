  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the COVID swab as the ordered test, and the contact with a sick friend during dog walks as the prompting detail. These facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all three specific parts of the question. However, compared to the Gold Answer, it omits supplementary context such as the patient's uncertainty regarding the friend's test result, the negative screening for COVID-specific symptoms (smell, taste, confusion, aches), and the negative travel history mentioned in the Gold Answer to justify the testing strategy.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript excerpts provided ([D-43], [P-20]). There are no hallucinations or external fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and concise, addressing only the components requested in the prompt without unnecessary filler."
