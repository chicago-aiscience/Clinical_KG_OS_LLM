  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition both patient and doctor wanted to rule out (supported by P-1 and D-39), the swab test (D-39), 48-hour turnaround (D-39), and isolation instructions (D-39), matching the Gold Answer's core facts; however, it has a minor citation error (attributes patient mention to D-1 instead of P-1) and omits details like the test being 'today' and 'further instructions from public health,' making it a minor discrepancy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: condition (COVID-19), test (swab), turnaround (48 hours), main isolation instruction; missed: explicit 'today' for test, 'further instructions from public health,' and contextual explanations about pandemic/symptom overlap, covering about 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript (COVID-19 in P-1/D-39, swab/48 hours/isolation in D-39); minor citation error (D-1 instead of P-1) but no hallucinations or ungrounded content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured as bullet points directly addressing each part of the question (condition, test, time, instructions) with no off-topic content, perfectly focused."
