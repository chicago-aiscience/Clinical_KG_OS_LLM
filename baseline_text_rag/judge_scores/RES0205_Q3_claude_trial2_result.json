  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis and accurately states the test was negative. However, it incorrectly cites dialogue turns as 'D-35' when the information comes from patient turns 'P-35' and 'P-36'. The core facts align with the Gold Answer despite citation errors.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the three main components requested (diagnosis, evidence, testing results) but lacks significant detail present in the Gold Answer. It omits: the specific timeline (test done at symptom onset ~2 weeks ago), the full range of evidence (flu-like symptoms, occupational exposure details, PPE use, patient staying home since testing), and the nuanced context (social pressure, concern about returning to work). Coverage is approximately 40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is largely faithful to the transcript with accurate information about COVID-19 testing, hospital work, and negative result. However, the citation errors (using 'D-35' instead of 'P-35' and 'P-36') suggest potential confusion about the source material. The citations reference doctor turns when the information actually comes from patient turns, which is a minor grounding issue.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated (COVID-19), what evidence prompted it (hospital worker, persistent cough causing alarm), and what testing revealed (negative). All content is relevant with no tangential information."

  "summary": "The generated answer correctly identifies the key facts (COVID-19 investigation with negative result) and remains highly relevant to the question. However, it significantly lacks the detail and context provided in the Gold Answer, covering less than half of the key points such as timeline, symptom details, and patient's post-test actions. Citation errors (referencing doctor turns instead of patient turns) represent minor faithfulness issues but don't undermine the core accuracy of the content."
