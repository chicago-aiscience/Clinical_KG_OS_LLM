  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the doctor’s immediate plan in D-58: perform a physical exam, speak with/consult the physician, then return to the family to discuss next steps. It also correctly notes that the doctor asked about air filter changes (D-57). No statements directly contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core three-step immediate plan (exam → consult physician → return to discuss next steps), but omits other plan-related details in the Gold Answer (e.g., the offer for the parent to ask questions before proceeding, and that no tests/imaging/meds were specified). For environmental factors, it only mentions air filters and misses multiple assessed home exposures: smoking in the household, carpets (new), pets, wood-burning fireplace/stove, and contextual exposure information (townhouse; who lives in the home). Overall, environmental assessment coverage is very limited.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript (air filters at D-57; plan at D-58). No hallucinated exams, tests, treatments, or consultations beyond what was stated.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked elements (next steps plan and home environmental factors) without unrelated content, though it is incomplete on the environmental portion."
