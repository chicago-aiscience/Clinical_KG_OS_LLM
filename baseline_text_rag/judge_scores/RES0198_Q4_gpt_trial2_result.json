  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, correctly states a (COVID) swab was ordered, correctly gives the 48-hour turnaround time, and correctly repeats the isolation instruction while awaiting results. The only factual issue is the citation/attribution error: the patient mentioned COVID-19 at [P-1], not “D-1.”",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 to be ruled out, (2) swab test ordered, (3) done today, (4) results in 48 hours, (5) isolate at home/avoid others while waiting, (6) further instructions from public health after results. Generated Answer includes (1), (2), (4), (5), but omits (3) ‘today’ and (6) ‘further instructions from public health.’",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript, especially from [D-39]. However, it incorrectly claims the patient mentioned COVID in “D-1” (it is [P-1]), which is a transcript-grounding/citation error. No major hallucinated clinical content beyond that.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question elements (condition, test, turnaround time, instructions) with no meaningful tangents."
