  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the condition (COVID-19), the test used (COVID test), the timing (two weeks ago at symptom onset), and the primary workplace concern (coworkers' fear). All facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses one significant detail mentioned in the Gold Answer: the fact that the patient works specifically as a clerk at a hospital. This context is important to explaining why the exclusion was critical due to high-risk environments and protocols. It also omits the mention of the patient's use of PPE.",

    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the multi-part question without including extraneous information."
