  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the patient is on a statin for cholesterol and that prophylactic antibiotics were proposed for the tick bite, consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. It also correctly includes plans to send the tick for identification and to order blood work/serology. Minor issues: the statin is attributed to [D-15] (the patient reports it at [P-15]) and the answer omits the Gold Answer’s clarification that no antibiotic name/dose/duration was provided, but it does not introduce any clear factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers: current statin therapy; proposed prophylactic antibiotics; tick sent to lab; blood work/serology. Misses: patient’s denial of (drug) allergies; prior tick-bite episode treated with antibiotics; the doctor’s plan to consult another/supervising physician before finalizing; environmental prevention advice (insecticide/yard measures); the explicit note that no specific antibiotic regimen was stated. Overall this is about half to two-thirds of the Gold Answer’s key medication/treatment elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript (prophylactic antibiotics, tick identification, blood work). No major hallucinations. Minor attribution/citation imprecision for the statin (should be [P-15], not [D-15]) and the lab/titers discussion is in [D-18] as cited. Overall largely grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question about medications and treatments discussed (statin therapy, prophylactic antibiotics, diagnostic steps). No notable irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The answer is mostly accurate and on-topic, but it omits several medication/treatment details present in the Gold Answer (allergies, prior antibiotics, supervising-physician consult, and prevention advice), reducing completeness."
