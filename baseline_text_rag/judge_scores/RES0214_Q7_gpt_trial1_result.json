  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is essentially incomplete (it stops after “the patient's symptoms began”) and does not state any of the symptom sequence or timing described in the Gold Answer. It does not introduce incorrect facts, but it also does not provide the correct chronological progression required by the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer are entirely missing: (1) stuffy nose first, (2) sore throat next/around fever onset and persistent, (3) fever present for 3 days at presentation, (4) muscle aches starting 2–3 days and overlapping with fever, and (5) comparison to husband’s 1-week symptom timeline and staggered onset. Coverage is effectively 0%.",
    "faithfulness": "No substantive clinical claims are made, so there are no hallucinations or contradictions with the transcript. The limited text (“Based on the transcript excerpts…”) is consistent with the task framing and does not assert ungrounded details.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for a chronological symptom progression and comparison with the husband’s onset. The generated answer does not provide this information and therefore fails to address the question in a meaningful way."
