  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All items stated in the Generated Answer match what the doctor said in [D-52]: COVID swab testing, 14-day isolation, contact tracing only if COVID test is positive, and supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol or NSAIDs for aches). No incorrect or contradictory statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer captures the core requested components (test, 14-day isolation, when contact tracing happens, and supportive care advice). However, compared with the Gold Answer’s full plan, it omits: (1) expected test turnaround time (24–48 hours), (2) the explicit note that if not COVID it could be another viral illness, and (3) the explicit statement that management is supportive regardless of the result / no other prescriptions. These omissions make it slightly incomplete relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by [D-52]. No additional ungrounded details were added. Citation alignment is accurate (all points originate from D-52).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the management plan elements asked for (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing condition, supportive care recommendations) and does not add irrelevant material."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, well-grounded, and directly addresses the question, but it misses a few plan details present in the Gold Answer (notably the 24–48h result timeframe and the alternative-viral-illness/supportive-regardless framing)."
