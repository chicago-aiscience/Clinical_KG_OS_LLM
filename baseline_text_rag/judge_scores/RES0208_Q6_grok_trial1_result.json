  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab from D-37), physical examination (from D-38, consistent with D-37), and self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate if discharged, from D-37), with no factual errors or contradictions compared to the Gold Answer or transcript; minor phrasing differences like 'COVID swab' vs 'COVID-19 swab' are negligible.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: physical exam of chest (partially covered as 'physical exam'); diagnostic tests CXR and COVID swab (fully covered); self-isolation specifics from doctor if discharged (partially covered, cuts off mid-citation); timeline 24-48 hours (missing); public health nurse contact if positive (missing); disposition criteria based on results (missing). Covers approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (tests, phys exam, self-isolation) are directly verifiable in transcript at cited locations D-37/D-38; no hallucinations or unverifiable details present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured with bullets directly addressing the question's components (tests, phys exam, self-isolation), with no off-topic content, though truncated."
