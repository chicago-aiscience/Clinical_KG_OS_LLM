  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reports the doctor’s immediate plan in D-58: (1) do a physical exam, (2) go talk/consult with the physician, and (3) return to see the daughter and discuss next steps. It also correctly identifies that the doctor asked about changing air filters (D-57). It does not introduce any facts that contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Immediate next steps: Covers the 3 stated actions (exam, consult physician, return/discuss next steps). Misses that no tests/imaging/medications were specified and misses the offer for parent questions before proceeding. Environmental assessment: Only includes air-filter status; misses household smoking exposure, carpets (new), pets, wood-burning fireplaces/stoves, and household/living context (townhouse, who lives at home). Overall, this is substantially incomplete relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (air filters in D-57; plan in D-58). No apparent hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question (plan and environmental factors), but omits many relevant environmental factors."
