  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), the initial isolation instruction (until results return), and the condition for continued isolation (persistence of symptoms despite a negative result). These facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses the explicit 'overall assessment' statement mentioned in the Gold Answer (that symptoms are in line with COVID-19). It also omits the context regarding the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician and the rationale for the chest X-ray (COPD and breathing difficulty).",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript, specifically line D-43. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question regarding diagnostic tests, isolation, and conditions for continued isolation."
