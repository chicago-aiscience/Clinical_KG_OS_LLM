  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray) and isolation instructions (isolate until results, continue if symptoms persist even if negative) directly matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-43]. No factual errors or contradictions. However, it does not explicitly state the doctor's assessment that symptoms are 'in line with common symptoms of COVID-19' [D-43], a minor discrepancy as it implies assessment via structure but omits the quote.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Assessment (symptoms COVID-like [D-43]); 2) Tests (COVID swab, chest X-ray w/reasons: breathing issues [P-8-10], COPD [P-27]); 3) Isolate until results [D-43]; 4) Continue isolation if symptomatic post-negative [D-43]; 5) Heads up, consult doc, patient agreement. Generated covers tests (partial, no reasons), isolation instructions, continued condition (covers ~60-70%, misses assessment, reasons, context).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims (tests, isolation details) directly verifiable in [D-43] with accurate citations. No unverifiable or hallucinated content; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly focused on question elements (assessment/management incl. tests, isolation instructions, continued isolation conditions) via structured bullets; no irrelevant content."
