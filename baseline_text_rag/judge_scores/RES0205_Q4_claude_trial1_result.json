  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition, the COVID test as the diagnostic method, and the timing as two weeks ago at symptom onset. It also correctly identifies workplace concerns about colleagues being scared. However, it omits critical workplace context: the patient works at a hospital as a clerk, wears PPE, and has been staying home since testing. These details provide important context for understanding the workplace concerns.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of the Gold Answer's key points. It includes: (1) COVID-19 ruled out, (2) COVID test used, (3) test timing at symptom onset two weeks ago, and (4) colleagues being scared. However, it misses: (1) the hospital workplace setting, (2) the clerk position, (3) PPE usage demonstrating infection control awareness, (4) staying home since testing, (5) eagerness to return to work, (6) desire for medication related to workplace return, and (7) not wanting to be perceived as a health risk.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. COVID-19 ruled out (P-35), COVID test used (P-35), timing at symptom onset two weeks ago (P-36), and colleagues being scared (P-35) are all directly supported. No hallucinated information is present. The answer is grounded but incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all four components of the question: (1) condition ruled out, (2) specific test used, (3) timing relative to symptom onset, and (4) workplace-related concerns. While the workplace concerns section is brief, it is relevant and on-topic. No irrelevant information is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate information that directly addresses all components of the question with no hallucinations. However, it significantly lacks detail in explaining the workplace context (hospital setting, PPE usage, staying home) that makes the COVID-19 exclusion particularly important. The answer is correct but abbreviated, covering the essential facts while missing contextual depth present in the Gold Answer."
