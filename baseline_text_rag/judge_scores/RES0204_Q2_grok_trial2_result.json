  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the two diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray from D-37 and COVID swab from D-39) proposed by the doctor, matching the Gold Answer. It correctly quotes the specific rationale for the COVID swab as institutional protocol for patients with these symptoms (D-39), consistent with the Gold. No factual errors or contradictions; minor omission of additional details like X-ray explanation or discomfort does not affect core accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: no meds/history (partially given in question), procedures (chest X-ray [D-37], COVID swab [D-39]), X-ray explanation [D-39], swab rationale/protocol quote [D-39], discomfort/reassurance [D-39], plan [D-40], no treatments. Generated covers procedures with citations (100%) and exact swab rationale (100%), but misses X-ray explanation, discomfort, reassurance, plan, and history confirmation (covers ~80-90% of core question-related points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: chest X-ray proposed in D-37 ('might want to do a chest X Ray'), COVID swab in D-39 ('do a covid swab'), rationale verbatim from D-39 ('we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately'). Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing the proposed procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) with citations and providing the exact rationale for the COVID swab from the transcript. No off-topic content; perfectly focused."
