    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the patient's current statin use (citing [D-15], consistent with [P-15]), proposes prophylactic antibiotics ([D-6]), and mentions sending the tick to a lab and blood work ([D-18]), all of which match facts in the Gold Answer and transcript with no errors or contradictions.",

    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable: statin at [P-15]/[D-15/D-16 context], prophylactic antibiotics at [D-6], tick lab at [D-6]/[D-18], blood work at [D-18]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by listing current statin and proposed prophylactic antibiotics/treatments/tests, with no off-topic content."
