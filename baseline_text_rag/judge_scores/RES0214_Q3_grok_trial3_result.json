  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies fever and sore throat as the specific symptoms leading to suspicion of infectious etiology like COVID-19, matching the Gold Answer's explicit reference in [D-53]. It correctly states the lack of flu shot as the vaccination history prompting influenza consideration, aligning with [D-53], [P-53], and [D-54]. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) fever and sore throat as explicit key symptoms [D-53]; (2) broader symptom cluster (muscle aches, fever, stuffy nose, sore throat) [D-24]; (3) husband's similar symptoms [D-53]; (4) no flu shot prompting influenza [D-53/P-53/D-54]. Generated covers (1) and (4) fully, but misses (2) and (3), covering approximately 50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: patient reports fever, stuffy nose, sore throat [P-1]; doctor summarizes symptoms including fever/sore throat [D-24, D-53]; doctor asks about flu shot [D-53], patient denies [P-53], doctor raises influenza [D-54]. Citations (D-1, D-53, D-54) are accurate and relevant; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by specifying fever and sore throat for infectious/COVID-19 suspicion and lack of flu shot for influenza differential, with no off-topic content."
