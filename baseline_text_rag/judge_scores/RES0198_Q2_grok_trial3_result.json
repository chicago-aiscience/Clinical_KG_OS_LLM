  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately states the patient tried decongestants and assessed them as working 'a little bit,' matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-10]. It correctly identifies the doctor's recommendation of Tylenol Cold [D-39]. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) patient tried OTC decongestants [P-10]; (2) assessment 'worked a little bit' with reasoning (stuffy to runny) [P-10]; (3) doctor recommended hydration and Tylenol Cold [D-39], plus viral context. Generated covers (1) decongestants tried, (2) 'worked a little bit,' (3) Tylenol Cold. Misses detailed reasoning on assessment, hydration, and viral/supportive care context. Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'decongestants... worked a little bit' from [P-10]; 'Tylenol cold' from [D-39]. Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses all three parts of the question (med tried, assessment, OTC recommended) with no off-topic content. Perfectly focused."
