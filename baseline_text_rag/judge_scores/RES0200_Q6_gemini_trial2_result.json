    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate for the portions it provides. All laboratory tests and imaging mentioned match the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer is severely incomplete. It truncates mid-list under 'Therapeutic Interventions', failing to mention steroids, antibiotics, or the continuation of bronchodilators. It also misses the blood pressure monitoring mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript [D-37].",
    "faithfulness": "All provided information is grounded in the transcript. There are no hallucinations; the response simply cuts off before completion.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant to the question but fails to provide the 'comprehensive' plan requested due to its truncated nature."
