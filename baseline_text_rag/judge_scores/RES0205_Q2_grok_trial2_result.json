  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient is not taking any prescribed medications (matching Gold [P-23]), mentions past anxiety medication stopped 2-3 years ago (matching [P-24]), and correctly describes acid reflux management via dietary avoidance of trigger foods like acidic foods and chocolates (matching [P-25]). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer, though it omits hay fever and cough details explicitly listed in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: no current prescribed meds [P-23], past anxiety meds [P-24], acid reflux managed by diet only [P-25], no meds for reflux. Missed: hay fever (no treatment described [P-27]), cough (patient requested meds [P-35] but none prescribed [D-37]), explicit summary of zero meds across all conditions including hay fever and cough. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-23, P-24, P-25); no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses current medication status (none), past anxiety meds, and specifically acid reflux management as per question; minor incompleteness on other conditions (hay fever, cough) but no off-topic content."
