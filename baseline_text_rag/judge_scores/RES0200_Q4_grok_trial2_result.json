  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID (abbreviated as 'Covid') as the alternative diagnosis due to symptom overlap with COPD exacerbation, specifies the COVID swab as the test ordered, and states the turnaround time as 24 to 48 hours, all matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. The citation to D-53 is minor and harmless as the key info is in D-52. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), reason (symptom overlap), test (COVID swab [D-52]), turnaround time (24-48 hours [D-52]). Generated Answer covers all these 100%, though it omits elaborative details like specific patient symptoms (cough, SOB, chills) which are not core to the question's three parts.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-52]: 'symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid we'll also do a covid swab... results in 24 to 48 hours.' Citations accurate; no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time) with no off-topic content."
