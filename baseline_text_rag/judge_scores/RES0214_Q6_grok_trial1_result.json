    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer lists COVID swab [D-53], self-isolation for patient and husband [D-53,D-54], physical exam [D-52], and consult with supervising doctor/return [D-55]. Generated correctly states swab [D-53], self-isolation for both [D-53,D-54], physical exam [D-52], and paraphrases 'investigate/work up further' from [D-53] which aligns but does not contradict. No factual errors in stated content, but omits consult detail present in Gold; core facts match with minor discrepancy in next steps detail. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) COVID-19 swab ordered; 2) self-isolation for patient and husband; 3) physical exam as next step; 4) consult supervising physician and return to patient. Covered: 1,2,3 fully; partially covers 4 via 'investigate further' but misses explicit consult/return. Patient agreement minor/not covered. Covers ~75% of key points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: COVID swab in [D-53]; self-isolate patient/husband in [D-53]; keep to themselves/infectious in [D-54]; physical exam in [D-52]; investigate/work up in [D-53]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated content. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured precisely around the question's elements (test ordered, precautionary measures for patient/husband, next steps), with bullet points matching exactly and no extraneous content. Fully addresses question. Score: 5."
