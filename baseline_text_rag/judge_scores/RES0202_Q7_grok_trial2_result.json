  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that on Wednesday the child seemed fine at school but developed a dry cough, which matches the Gold Answer and transcript [P-1] with no factual errors or contradictions in the limited information provided.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: Wednesday evening cough onset after fine at school; Thursday cough worse and tired; Friday cough worsening, first fever (>100°F), decreased appetite/loss of taste, fatigue, runny nose, mother's summary/correction to 3 days. Generated covers only ~10% (partial Wednesday cough onset), misses all Thursday details, Friday details, severity progression, other symptoms, and summary.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (Wednesday fine at school, dry cough onset) are directly verifiable in transcript [P-1]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer begins directly addressing the question's day-by-day evolution starting with Wednesday but abruptly stops without covering Thursday, Friday, severity changes, fever, or other symptoms, making it only partially responsive."
