  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence. However, what is present is factually accurate - it correctly identifies asthma as the top differential and cardiac ischemia as less likely, which aligns with D-35 and D-36. No factual errors are present in the partial content provided.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete, covering less than 20% of the required information. It only mentions the assessment portion and cuts off abruptly. It completely omits: (1) the physical examination plan (lung auscultation), (2) the specific first-step treatment intervention (rescue puffers), (3) the contingency plan if rescue inhalers don't work, (4) the stepwise approach, and (5) consultation with supervising physician. The answer fails to address three of the four main components explicitly requested in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The partial content that exists is grounded in the transcript, specifically citing D-35 and D-36. The assessment about asthma being top of differential and cardiac causes being lower is directly from the conversation. No hallucinations are present in the incomplete fragment, though the answer doesn't provide complete citations or elaborate on the grounded information.",
    "relevance": "The fragment begins to address the question by discussing the assessment component, which is relevant. However, the answer is so incomplete that it fails to address the majority of what was asked - specifically the physical examination components, treatment intervention, and contingency approach. The incomplete nature makes it largely non-responsive to the full question despite starting appropriately."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence after barely beginning to address the question. While the partial content present is factually accurate and grounded in the transcript (correctly identifying asthma as top differential and cardiac causes as less likely), it covers less than 20% of required information. The answer completely fails to address three critical components: physical examination plans (lung auscultation), first-step treatment (rescue puffers), and contingency approach (reassessment if initial treatment fails). The incomplete nature renders it largely unhelpful despite the accurate beginning."
