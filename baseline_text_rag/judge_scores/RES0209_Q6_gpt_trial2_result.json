  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer’s main plan elements: (1) a COVID-19 swab was proposed (D-29), (2) a possible change in asthma medications was suggested to improve control (D-43), and (3) the clinician planned to speak with the supervising doctor and then return to the patient shortly (D-43). No statements contradict the transcript or Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: COVID swab; suggestion of a medication change to improve asthma control; plan to consult the supervising physician and return. Key points partially/omitted relative to the Gold Answer: the explicit framing that the interviewer appears to be a trainee presenting the case (\"tell him/her everything you said\" and earlier \"before I go talk to the doctor\"), and the stated functional goal of better symptom control so the patient can play sports without needing medication each time (D-42).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (COVID swab in D-29; medication change in D-43; talk to doctor and return in D-43). No hallucinated details or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what the question asks for: the diagnostic test in the COVID context, the medication-regimen suggestion, and the next steps involving consultation with the supervising physician."
