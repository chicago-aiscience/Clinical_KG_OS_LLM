  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient only takes multivitamins (P-40), reports a penicillin allergy (P-37), and experiences a rash from penicillin (P-38). These match the Gold Answer with no contradictions or inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core items needed to answer the question: current regimen (multivitamins only), the allergen (penicillin), and the specific reaction (rash). It does not include additional Gold Answer context (e.g., not on any prescription meds despite prediabetes; no trouble breathing with the reaction), though those are supportive details and not strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript with correct references (P-40, P-37, P-38). No hallucinated or unverifiable claims are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what was asked (medication regimen, drug allergy, and adverse reaction) with no extraneous content."
