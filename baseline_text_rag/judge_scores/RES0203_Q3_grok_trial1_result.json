  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key symptoms (loss of smell, taste, and mild dry cough) that led to COVID-19 suspicion, correctly quotes the doctor's connection in D-39, and specifies the swab test, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancies include slightly imprecise citations (D-1 and D-5 reference doctor questions rather than direct patient symptom statements in P-1/P-4) and omission of patient's initial concern (P-1), confirmation of absent symptoms (e.g., no fever in P-10), and 'pretty well' summary (D-16), but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: symptoms (loss of smell/taste/dry cough), doctor's explicit connection (D-39 quote), and test (swab in D-39). Missed: patient's initial COVID worry (P-1), systematic ruling out of other symptoms (e.g., fever P-10, breathing P-11, etc.), 'pretty well' summary (D-16), narrow symptom profile rationale, and self-isolation emphasis (D-39). Covers approximately 50-60% of Gold Answer's key points, focusing on core but lacking explanatory depth.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript: symptoms from patient's reports (P-1, P-4, P-6-7), doctor's statement and test order verbatim from D-39. Citations to D-1/D-5 are not perfectly precise (symptoms voiced by patient), but content is grounded with no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly identifies the symptom combination, quotes the doctor's connection to COVID-19, and specifies the swab test method, perfectly addressing the question without irrelevant content or tangents."
