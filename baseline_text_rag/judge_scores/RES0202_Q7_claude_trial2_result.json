  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer only covers Wednesday and is incomplete. It correctly states the child seemed fine at school and developed a dry cough on Wednesday evening, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it's cut off mid-response and doesn't provide the day-by-day progression through Thursday and Friday as required by the question.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the required content. It only addresses Wednesday and provides no information about Thursday (persistent worsening cough, fatigue) or Friday (fever emergence, continued cough worsening, decreased appetite, possible taste loss, runny nose). The Gold Answer provides a comprehensive three-day timeline with all symptom progressions clearly detailed.",
    "faithfulness": "What little content is provided is grounded in the transcript. The statement about Wednesday evening matches [P-1] where the parent states 'that night he started to have a bit of like a cough' and describes it as a 'little dry cough.' However, the answer appears incomplete or truncated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer begins to address the question appropriately by starting a chronological day-by-day account, but fails to deliver the complete timeline requested. The question specifically asks for details through Friday including when cough appeared, severity changes, and emergence of fever and other symptoms - none of which are fully covered."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete, appearing to be cut off after only addressing Wednesday. While the limited content provided is factually accurate and grounded in the transcript, it fails to deliver the comprehensive three-day progression requested in the question. It does not cover Thursday's symptoms or Friday's critical developments (fever emergence, worsening cough, decreased appetite, fatigue, runny nose). The answer covers less than 20% of the required information from the Gold Answer."
