  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated plan in D-37: to review the information with the doctor working that day and then return shortly to discuss next steps, including possible tests and how to proceed. No statements conflict with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core Gold Answer elements relevant to the question: (1) involvement of another doctor in decision-making and (2) planned follow-up discussion and possible testing/plan. It omits additional details present in the Gold Answer (e.g., inference that the speaker may be a trainee, that no specific tests/treatments were named, patient acknowledgment, and the farewell).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (D-37). No extra or fabricated details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what next steps were communicated, who would be involved (the doctor working today), and what follow-up actions were mentioned (return shortly, discuss tests and moving forward). No irrelevant content."
