  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer and transcript: COVID-19 swab (D-29), suggestion of medication change (D-43), and consultation with supervising physician followed by return (D-43). No factual errors or contradictions; minor details like negative screening or patient med history are omitted but not misrepresented.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnostic test (COVID swab), medication change suggestion, consultation/next steps. Missed: context of negative infectious screening, patient's current rescue-only regimen and increased use, sports goal (D-42), explicit trainee status, and additional citations (D-29 earlier ref, D-44). Covers ~85% of Gold's content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (D-29, D-43). No hallucinations; 'supervising physician' is a reasonable paraphrase of 'the doctor' in context of trainee presentation.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the three specified elements (diagnostic test, medication change, consultation/next steps) with no off-topic content."
