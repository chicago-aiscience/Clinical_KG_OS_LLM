  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main risk factors: medication non-adherence (missing Keppra dose) and hereditary predisposition (mother had epilepsy). The facts align with the Gold Answer and are accurate. However, it presents these facts in a more condensed form without the depth of explanation provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the essential key points but lacks significant detail present in the Gold Answer. It mentions: (1) missed medication dose, (2) routine disruption due to birthday, (3) epilepsy diagnosis, and (4) maternal family history. However, it omits several important details from the Gold Answer: the patient's acknowledgment that missing medication likely caused the seizure (P-9), that seizures are normally infrequent suggesting good control with medication, the specific citation about what the clinician asked (D-26), and the explanation of how hereditary predisposition establishes genetic vulnerability consistent with the diagnosis. Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The medication (Keppra) is mentioned in P-23, the missed dose and birthday explanation in P-24, epilepsy diagnosis in P-8, and maternal epilepsy history in P-26. No hallucinated content is present. The answer is well-grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) what hereditary and medication-related risk factors contributed to the seizure, and (2) how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. It stays focused without tangents or irrelevant information. The answer is concise and on-topic throughout."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate information that directly addresses the question with proper citations. It correctly identifies both medication non-adherence and hereditary factors as contributors to the seizure episode, and appropriately links the maternal family history to the patient's epilepsy diagnosis. However, it lacks the depth and comprehensiveness of the Gold Answer, omitting important contextual details such as the patient's own acknowledgment of the medication-seizure connection, the normally infrequent nature of seizures suggesting good baseline control, and the fuller explanation of how genetic predisposition relates to the diagnosis. The answer is faithful to the transcript with accurate citations and maintains strong relevance throughout, but would benefit from more complete coverage of available information."
