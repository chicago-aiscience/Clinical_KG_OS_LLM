  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer provides no factual content about the patient's symptoms, progression, or husband's timeline, making it entirely inconsistent with the Gold Answer's detailed sequence (stuffy nose first, then sore throat and fever, muscle aches concurrent, husband's onset a week prior); no facts are present to be accurate or erroneous, but absence equates to full lack of correctness vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) stuffy nose first ('just before' fever); 2) sore throat around fever onset, ongoing; 3) fever for 3 days; 4) muscle aches concurrent with fever (2-3 days); 5) husband symptoms for past week (~4 days before patient's fever); 6) staggered onset consistent with transmission. Generated covers 0% of these; all missed.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes no substantive claims beyond an introductory phrase 'Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient's symptoms began,' which is verifiable as the transcript discusses symptom onset (e.g., [P-1], [D-2/P-2]); no hallucinations, but lacks content to fully ground; minor phrasing on 'excerpts' (full transcript provided).",
    "relevance": "The opening directly signals intent to address symptom onset from transcript, aligning with question on progression and timeline comparison, but abruptly stops without content, making it partially relevant with no off-topic elements."
