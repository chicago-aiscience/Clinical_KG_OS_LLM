  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two central factors: (1) medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose due to disrupted routine) and (2) hereditary risk via maternal epilepsy. It is also reasonable to link the missed dose to seizure precipitation, consistent with the patient’s statement. Minor issue: it cites the epilepsy diagnosis as [P-9], whereas the explicit diagnosis statement appears at [P-8]; however, the diagnosis itself is correct and supported by the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covers the main Gold Answer points: missed Keppra dose and maternal family history of epilepsy. It omits some supporting details present in the Gold Answer, including the patient’s explicit attribution that missing the medication likely triggered the seizure (\"I think that might have\") and that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent. Overall, it captures the core but not all nuance.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements are grounded in the transcript (missed Keppra due to birthday routine change; mother had epilepsy). The only notable issue is an inaccurate citation for the epilepsy diagnosis (should be [P-8], not [P-9]). No clear hallucinations beyond that citation mismatch.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question about hereditary and medication-related risk factors and connects family history to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis without extraneous content."
