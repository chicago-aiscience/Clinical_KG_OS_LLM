  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies fever and sore throat as explicitly identified key symptoms (D-53), which Generated Answer correctly identifies with accurate citations (D-1 for patient report, D-53 for doctor's statement). No factual errors or contradictions in the core claims about symptoms and flu shot. Minor discrepancy: omits broader symptom cluster and epidemiological context (husband's symptoms), but core facts match.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) fever/sore throat explicit (covered); 2) broader symptoms (muscle aches, fever, stuffy nose, sore throat from D-24, not covered); 3) husband's similar symptoms (D-53, not covered); 4) no flu shot prompting influenza (covered). Covers ~50% of key points (explicit symptoms and vaccination), misses supporting details on broader symptoms and epidemiology.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: fever/sore throat verifiable in patient history (P-1, D-24, D-53) and doctor's words (D-53); no flu shot in P-53, doctor's response in D-54. Citations accurate to transcript sections. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of question: symptoms (fever, sore throat) for infectious/COVID suspicion and vaccination history (no flu shot) for influenza differential. Concise, no tangents or off-topic content."
