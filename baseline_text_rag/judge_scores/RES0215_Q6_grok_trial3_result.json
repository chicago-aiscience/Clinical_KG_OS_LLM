  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the doctor's plan from [D-58] as performing a physical exam, consulting the physician, returning to see the daughter, and discussing next steps, which matches the Gold Answer's depiction of the three steps without errors or contradictions. It correctly notes one environmental factor (air filters from [D-57]), which is factual. No fabricated facts or contradictions with Gold, but it underrepresents the full scope of environmental assessment; core facts are correct with minor discrepancy in comprehensiveness.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: doctor's plan (physical exam, consult physician, return/discuss next steps). Missed: no specific tests/imaging/medications mentioned; offer for mother to raise questions and her decline [P-58]; environmental factors (smoking [P-53], new carpets [P-54], no pets [P-55], no wood-burning fireplaces/stoves [P-56], townhouse [P-50], family living situation [P-49])—only air filters covered out of multiple. Covers ~30-40% of key points (full plan but minimal env).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: air filters question [D-57/P-57], plan details [D-58]; citations accurate (D-57, D-58). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications—fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question (doctor's plan for next steps and home environmental factors assessed), with focused content on transcript evidence; no tangents or off-topic material."
