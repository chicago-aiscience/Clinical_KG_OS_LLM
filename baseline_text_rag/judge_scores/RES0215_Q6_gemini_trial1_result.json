The Gold Answer and transcript mention smoking, carpets, pets, fireplaces, and household composition (living in a townhouse with parents), whereas the generated answer only mentions air filters.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is directly supported by the transcript with no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question, although the second part is only partially answered."
