{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All items the Generated Answer *does* list match the Gold Answer and are supported by the transcript: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring, and supplemental oxygen as needed are all stated in [D-52]. No contradictory or false statements are introduced. The therapeutic section is truncated, but that is an omission rather than an incorrect claim.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer includes some key components (labs: CBC/electrolytes/kidney function/ABG + COVID swab; imaging: CXR; monitoring: O2 saturation; intervention: supplemental O2 PRN). However, it omits several major Gold Answer elements: continuation of bronchodilators, systemic steroids, antibiotics (all in [D-52]), and the additional note about ongoing blood pressure monitoring from [D-37]. Overall coverage is well under 80% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included elements are directly grounded in the transcript ([D-52]) and align with the Gold Answer. No evident hallucinations or unverifiable additions. The answer does not cite [D-37] and does not fabricate any additional monitoring beyond what is said.",
    "relevance": "The response remains focused on the requested management plan categories (tests, imaging, monitoring, therapies). There is no irrelevant content; the main deficiency is missing requested components rather than off-topic material."
