  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered and ruled out. It accurately reports the mother’s stated supporting negatives: the patient has been worked up for asthma and does not have shortness of breath or wheezing, even with physical activity. These points align with P-28 and do not conflict with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) asthma was the condition, (2) prior workup, (3) absence of shortness of breath, (4) absence of wheeze, (5) absence even with physical activity. Missing elements: explicit mention that the positive family history was in the grandparents (and the clinician’s acknowledgment of family asthma), the mother’s explicit conclusion (“he doesn’t have that”), and the additional contextual negative from P-24 (otherwise healthy/never had a dry cough like this before).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (P-28). No apparent hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on the asked respiratory condition and the specific negative symptoms (including during exertion). However, it does not explicitly address the ‘positive family history in the grandparents’ part of the question, so it is slightly incomplete relative to what was asked."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded identification of asthma with key exertional negative symptoms, but incomplete because it omits the explicit grandparent family-history detail and a few supporting statements noted in the Gold Answer."
