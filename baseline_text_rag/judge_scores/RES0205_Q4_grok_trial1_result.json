  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition, the COVID test as the method, and the timing as two weeks ago at symptom onset, all matching the Gold Answer and transcript. The workplace concerns mentioned (colleagues scared, desire to return without coughing) are accurate, with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 ruled out, (2) via 'covid test' negative [P-35], (3) at symptom onset two weeks prior [P-36], (4) hospital clerk job [P-34], (5) PPE use [P-17], (6) coworkers scared [P-35], (7) staying home post-test [P-36], (8) eagerness to return without coughing [P-36], (9) medication desire linked to workplace return [P-35]. Generated covers 1-3 and 6,8; misses 4,5,7,9 (about 55-60% coverage).",
