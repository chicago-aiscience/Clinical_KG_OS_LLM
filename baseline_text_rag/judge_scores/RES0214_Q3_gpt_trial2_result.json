  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript and Gold Answer that fever and sore throat prompted concern for an infectious etiology/COVID-19 (explicitly stated at D-53). It also correctly identifies the vaccination-history detail that the patient had not received a flu shot this year (P-53), prompting consideration of influenza (D-54). No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core symptom drivers (fever, sore throat) and the key vaccination-history point (no flu shot). However, it omits additional supportive elements highlighted in the Gold Answer: the broader symptom cluster (stuffy nose, muscle aches) and the epidemiologic context that the husband had similar symptoms, which the doctor used to justify COVID as the first rule-out (D-53).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are grounded in the transcript: fever and sore throat are clearly reported (P-1) and referenced by the doctor (D-53); lack of flu vaccination is explicitly stated (P-53) and linked to influenza by the doctor (D-54). No hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question (symptoms prompting infectious/COVID suspicion and the vaccination detail prompting influenza in the differential) without extraneous content."
