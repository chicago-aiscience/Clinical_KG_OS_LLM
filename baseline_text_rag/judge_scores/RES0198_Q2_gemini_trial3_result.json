    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the previous medication (decongestants), the patient's assessment (worked a little bit), and the doctor's recommendation (Tylenol Cold). All statements align with the gold answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the core components of the question but misses several details provided in the gold answer: it omits the patient's specific reasoning for the effectiveness (the transition from stuffy to runny), the doctor's recommendation for hydration as part of the treatment, and the context regarding the expected duration of the illness.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript, specifically referencing P-10 and D-39. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the three parts of the question without any extraneous information."
