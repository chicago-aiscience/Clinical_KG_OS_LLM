  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key facts: activities on Friday/Saturday leading to >72 hour attachment duration calculation, and Strathroy's position on the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map justifying prophylactic treatment. However, it incorrectly cites [D-5] which discusses tick identification, not attachment duration. The correct citation for the 72-hour calculation is [D-6]. The core facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points but lacks important supporting details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the patient's uncertainty about when the tick attached ('I don't really know when I got it'), (2) the specific timing detail that tick was discovered 'earlier today', (3) the specific location detail 'along the creek', (4) the exact phrasing about Strathroy being 'close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point', and (5) the explicit statement about 'combination' of factors. The answer provides approximately 60-70% of the Gold Answer's key details.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations for most claims. However, the citation [D-5] is incorrect - that exchange discusses tick species identification, not attachment duration. The 72-hour calculation actually appears in [D-6]. All other claims are verifiable in the cited exchanges [D-6, D-12, D-13]. Minor citation error but no fabricated content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) how the Friday/Saturday activities contributed to the >72 hour attachment duration estimate, and (2) how Strathroy's position on the map justified prophylactic treatment. The response stays focused without tangents or irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core facts about attachment duration calculation and geographic risk assessment, directly addressing both parts of the question. However, it contains a minor citation error ([D-5] instead of [D-6]) and lacks important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as patient's uncertainty about timing, specific location details, and the explicit connection between combined factors leading to treatment decision. The answer is factually accurate and relevant but could be more complete."
