  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the respiratory inhalers (Ventolin, Spiriva) and the discontinued medication (diuretic). It also correctly notes the frequency of Ventolin use. However, it fails to mention 'Atorvastatin' (Torva Staten), which was explicitly identified in the Gold Answer as a non-respiratory medication the patient was currently taking for cholesterol.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses one key medication (Atorvastatin) despite the prompt specifically asking for both respiratory and non-respiratory drugs. It covers the respiratory inhalers, the frequency of use, and the discontinued medication, but falls short on the full list of current non-respiratory medications.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made are grounded in the transcript. However, there is a minor error in the citations: the answer attributes the information to 'D' (Doctor) prefixes (e.g., [D-11], [D-12]) whereas the factual content of the meds and frequency are found in the patient's responses ('P' prefixes).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question, providing specific names and frequencies without unnecessary filler."
