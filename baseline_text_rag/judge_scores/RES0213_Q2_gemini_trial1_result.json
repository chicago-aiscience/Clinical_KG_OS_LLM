    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly claims that the information is not found in the provided excerpts. The transcript explicitly mentions the use of Tylenol, Advil, and Alka-Seltzer (P-6) for pain, their lack of effectiveness (P-6), and the use of a multivitamin (P-25). Thus, the generated answer is factually incorrect relative to the gold answer and the source text.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer provides zero information from the gold answer. It misses all key points including specific OTC medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), their effectiveness (not helpful), and regular supplements (multivitamin).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript as it denies the existence of information that is clearly present. This is a failure to ground the response in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer fails to address the question entirely by claiming the information is missing when it is not."
