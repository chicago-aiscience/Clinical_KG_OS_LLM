  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the diagnosis at age 8 (consistent with P-2, D-2, D-3), baseline bronchodilator use once every two weeks (P-8), current cough 'almost nonstop' (P-1), and shortness of breath (P-1). These match the Gold Answer's facts without errors or contradictions, though it truncates and omits some details like current age and usage escalation; no factual inaccuracies present.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: diagnosis at 8/now 10 (2-yr history), baseline usage once/2wks/not often, triggers (exercise/cold/seasonal), 2-wk exacerbation with nonstop dry cough, increased wheezing/SOB/chest tightness, usage now 5-6x/wk (wheezing > usage), nighttime sx every other day, no precipitant. Covered: diagnosis age 8, baseline usage, cough nonstop/past week, SOB. Missed: current age/history length, triggers, exact 2-wk duration clarification, bronchodilator escalation (critical), wheezing details/chest tightness/nighttime/no precipitant. Covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from transcript: age 8 diagnosis (D-2/P-2/D-3), baseline usage (P-8), cough nonstop/past week/SOB (P-1). Citations accurate (P-8, etc.). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded despite truncation.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses temporal evolution (diagnosis -> baseline usage -> current symptoms), quoting relevant phrases and citing transcript; no off-topic content, though incomplete and truncated mid-sentence."
