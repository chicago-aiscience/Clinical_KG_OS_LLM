  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states diagnosis at age 8 (matching P-2 and cited D-2/D-3), baseline bronchodilator use once every two weeks (P-8), current cough 'almost nonstop' for past week (P-1), and shortness of breath (P-1). Minor discrepancy: uses 'past week' without noting clarification to two weeks (P-13); does not contradict but omits full context. Core facts accurate vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: diagnosis age 8/now 10; baseline well-controlled (once/2wks), triggers (exercise/cold/seasonal); two-week exacerbation (cough nonstop, wheezing increased, SOB, chest tightness, bronchodilator 5-6x/wk, wheezing > use frequency, nighttime sx, no precipitant). Generated covers diagnosis, baseline usage, current cough/SOB (~25% coverage); misses triggers, bronchodilator escalation (crucial), wheezing details, chest tightness, nighttime, no infection, age 10, seasonal.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: age 8 (D-2/P-2/D-3), baseline (P-8), cough (P-1), SOB (P-1). Citations accurate (D-2/D-3/P-8). No hallucinations; truncated but grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses evolution (diagnosis -> baseline usage -> current symptoms); no off-topic content, perfectly focused on question despite truncation."
