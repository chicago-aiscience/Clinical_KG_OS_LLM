  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "What is stated is broadly consistent with the Gold Answer/transcript: the child has seasonal allergies and has had recurrent viral infections over the past two years, and the wheeze/SOB is activity-associated. No clear contradictory or incorrect clinical claims are made. However, the response is truncated and does not correctly synthesize how all factors relate. Minor issue: it cites “D-35/D-15” whereas these are patient lines (P-35/P-15).",
    "completeness": "Misses most key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions: (1) seasonal allergies, (2) recurrent viral infections, and partially (3) exercise-associated symptoms. It omits: new carpets as a potential indoor irritant, cold-weather sensitivity as a bronchospasm trigger, the atopic/asthma/hyperresponsive airway synthesis, the lack of direct temporal link for carpets, and the additional environmental negatives (no smoke/pets/wood stove; filters changed). Overall coverage is well under full synthesis requested.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript (seasonal allergies; recurrent viral infections; exercise/activity-related wheeze). No obvious hallucinated exposures or symptoms. The only weakness is inaccurate line labeling (D vs P) and the incomplete, cut-off sentence.",
    "relevance": "It addresses the correct general topic (linking history factors to wheeze/SOB with activity), but it does not answer the question about how the factors collectively relate, and it ends abruptly."
