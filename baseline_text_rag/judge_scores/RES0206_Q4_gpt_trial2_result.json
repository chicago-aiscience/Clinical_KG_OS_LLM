{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, correctly states that a COVID swab was ordered, and accurately cites the patient’s exposure detail (walking dogs with a friend who was sick and sometimes being too close). No contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "For the specific question (condition, test, and the prompting social-contact detail), the answer includes the main elements: COVID-19, COVID swab, and contact with a sick friend during dog walks with occasional close proximity. It omits the additional Gold Answer detail that the patient didn’t know whether the friend had a COVID test, and other screening questions (smell/taste, etc.), which are supportive context but not strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (D-43 for ruling out COVID and ordering a swab; P-20 for the sick friend and close proximity outdoors). No apparent hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question with no tangential material."
