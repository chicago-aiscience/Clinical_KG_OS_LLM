  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab), imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (oxygen saturation), and one therapeutic intervention (supplemental oxygen) directly matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52] with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: all laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs, COVID swab), chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring, supplemental oxygen. Missed: continuation of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, and blood pressure monitoring [D-37]. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (labs, imaging, monitoring, supplemental oxygen) are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured precisely to address the question by categorizing laboratory tests, imaging studies, monitoring procedures, and therapeutic interventions, with no off-topic content."
