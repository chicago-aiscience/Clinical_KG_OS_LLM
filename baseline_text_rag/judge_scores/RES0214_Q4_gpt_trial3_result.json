  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the ordered diagnostic test as a COVID-19 swab (consistent with D-53). It also correctly states the doctor prioritized ruling out COVID-19 because the patient’s husband had similar symptoms and thus COVID-19 would be the first condition to exclude (also consistent with D-53). The added mention of “fever and sore throat” is compatible with the doctor’s statement about fever/sore throat presentations prompting infectious rule-out, and does not contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Includes: (1) COVID-19 swab test; (2) prioritization of COVID-19 due to symptomatic husband/household pattern.\nMisses: (3) the doctor’s containment/urgency rationale reflected by advising self-isolation while awaiting COVID rule-out; (4) that influenza was raised only after COVID-19 discussion and after learning she had not received a flu shot. Overall captures the main rationale but not all key contextual points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in the transcript (especially D-53). No clear hallucinations or unsupported details. Does not introduce incorrect testing or motivations beyond what is stated.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (test ordered and why COVID-19 was prioritized over influenza) without tangents."
