    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the facts from the Gold Answer and transcript without any errors or contradictions: COVID swab with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation due to COVID-compatible symptoms, isolation including younger sister, and specific ER red flags all match [D-44] precisely.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab test (full), 14-day isolation (full), isolation from younger sister (mostly, misses 'if possible'), ER red flags (full). Missed: full household composition including parents [P-35], false-negative possibility and other viral illness, no medications/supportive care/wait for results, mother's acknowledgment of viral care, school test requirement [P-41]. Covers approximately 60% of Gold key points.",

    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses the question's focus on management measures (tests), isolation instructions/duration, and specific household member (sister) to isolate from, with relevant addition of red flags; no off-topic content."
