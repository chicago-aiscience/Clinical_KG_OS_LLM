  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, the swab as the diagnostic test, 24-48 hours as the turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. All citations to D-52 are appropriate and match the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all the essential key points from the Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 as the primary condition, (2) swab test ordered, (3) 24-48 hours turnaround time, and (4) alternative viral illness diagnosis. However, it omits supplementary details present in the Gold Answer such as the doctor's explanation about symptom overlap with COVID, the 14-day isolation instruction, public health contact tracing if positive, and the supportive management approach. These omissions represent approximately 20-30% of the content in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the source transcript at D-52. The answer contains no hallucinated information and properly cites the source. The doctor explicitly states these facts in the transcript, making the Generated Answer fully grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and precisely addresses all components of the question: the condition to rule out, the specific diagnostic test, the turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis. There is no irrelevant content, and the answer is perfectly focused on answering the multi-part question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate, well-grounded response that directly addresses all components of the question. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, the swab test with 24-48 hour turnaround, and alternative viral illness as the backup diagnosis. While it captures all essential points, it omits some supplementary details from the Gold Answer such as isolation instructions, contact tracing, and management approach, resulting in approximately 80% coverage of the Gold Answer's content."
