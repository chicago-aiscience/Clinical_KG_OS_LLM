  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately paraphrases the key statements from D-37 without any factual errors or contradictions to the Gold Answer or transcript. All mentioned elements (reviewing with the other doctor, returning shortly, discussing next steps, potential tests, moving forward) are fully consistent with both.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: reviewing info with the other doctor (who is involved), coming back shortly, discussing next steps/tests/how to move forward. Missed: explicit inference about interviewer being a trainee/student, detailed collaborative process description, patient acknowledgment (P-37), emphasis on no specific tests ordered, contingency on other doctor's input, farewell in D-38, and full citation details. Covers core ~80% but lacks some nuances and supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in D-37 of the transcript ('go over it with the doctor was working today', 'come back shortly and talk to you about the next steps if there's any tests we want to do or how we want to move forward'). Citations accurate (D-37). No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses the question by specifying the communicated next steps (review with other doctor, return to discuss), who is involved (doctor working today), and follow-up actions (potential tests, moving forward). No off-topic content."
