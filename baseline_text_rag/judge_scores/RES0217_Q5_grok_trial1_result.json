  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer and transcript: the patient's Friday hiking and Saturday gardening activities led the doctor to estimate tick attachment >72 hours (verifiable in D-6), and the doctor's use of the Ontario Lyme map noting Strathroy as a 'concerning point' (D-13) justified prophylactics. No factual errors or contradictions, though less detailed than Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: Fri/Sat activities contributing to >72hr estimate [P-1, D-6]; Strathroy on map as concerning [P-12, D-13], leading to antibiotics. Missed details: patient's uncertainty/exact quotes [P-1], discovery 'earlier today' [D-1], 'little bit of time' [D-2], 'along the creek' [P-12], full prophylactic statements. Covers ~85% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: activities [P-1], >72hrs [D-6], map/Strathroy [D-13]. Citations mostly accurate (D-6 key for duration, D-5 tangential but not hallucinatory; D-12/D-13 spot-on). No fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question (duration from activities, map justification for treatment) with no off-topic content."
