  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as a “cardiac ischemic picture” and accurately reports the doctor’s cited reasons: symptoms characterized more as tightness than pain and the doctor’s statement that the patient didn’t really get out of breath with exercise, plus absence of pain. No statements contradict the transcript or the gold answer. Minor issue: it cites P-1 for ‘tightness rather than pain’ whereas the clearest explicit denial of pain is P-5, but the claim itself remains accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key gold points covered: (1) cardiac ischemia placed lower on the differential; (2) chest complaints described as tightness rather than pain; (3) doctor cited lack of classic exertional dyspnea; (4) absence of pain. Key gold points missed: the clinician-cited pertinent negatives of anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom (P-6 / D-6) as supportive evidence for lowering concern for an acute cardiac picture; also the nuance that the patient did report some difficulty getting a full breath (P-7) while the doctor characterized it as not really exertional dyspnea.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript (D-36 for ischemia lower, D-36 for no exertional dyspnea and no pain; P-1/P-5 for tightness rather than pain). No hallucinated symptoms or diagnoses are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by naming the condition lowered on the differential and describing the symptom findings the doctor used to justify it. It stays on-topic, but is missing some specifically asked-for absent symptoms."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded identification of cardiac ischemia being deprioritized with key supporting symptom features, but incomplete because it omits the doctor-screened absent red-flag symptoms (anxiety/sweating/impending doom)."
