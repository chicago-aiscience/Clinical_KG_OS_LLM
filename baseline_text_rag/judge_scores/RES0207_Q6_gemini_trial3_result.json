  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the information in both the transcript and the gold answer regarding the doctor's plan to review with another physician and return to discuss tests and next steps.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the primary actions mentioned in the gold answer (reviewing with a colleague, returning shortly, potential tests). However, it misses several nuanced points included in the gold answer: the inference that the interviewer is a trainee, the collaborative nature of the decision-making, the patient's agreement (P-37), and the observation that no specific treatments or tests were ordered yet.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely faithful to the source transcript, specifically referencing D-37 correctly without any hallucination or outside information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and concise, directly addressing the question about next steps, decision-makers, and follow-up actions without any off-topic content."
