  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is perfectly aligned with the facts in the Gold Answer and the transcript. It accurately identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition, the swab as the test, the 24-48 hour window, and another viral illness as the alternative.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the specific points requested by the question (the rule-out condition, the test, the timing, and the alternative). It omits some additional context provided in the Gold Answer, such as the instruction to isolate, contact tracing, and supportive management, which accounts for about 20-30% of the Gold Answer's content.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely grounded in the transcript, specifically referencing D-52 for all claims made. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and concise. It directly addresses the four-part question without adding extraneous information."
