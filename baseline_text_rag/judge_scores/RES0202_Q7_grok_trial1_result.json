  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that on Wednesday the child seemed fine at school but developed a dry cough, which is fully consistent with the Gold Answer and directly supported by [P-1] in the transcript ('when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but ... that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough'). No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Wed eve: fine after school, little dry cough onset, no others; (2) Thu: cough persisted & bit worse, really tired; (3) Fri: cough worsening, fever first (>100°F), decreased appetite/loss of taste, fatigue, runny nose; (4) stepwise worsening summary, 3-day correction. Generated covers only partial Wed (cough onset after fine at school), misses Thu entirely, Fri entirely, severity progression, fever/other symptoms timing, ~10% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer ('seemed fine at school but developed a dry cough' on Wednesday) are directly verifiable in [P-1] of the transcript; no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer begins directly addressing the question's request for day-by-day evolution (starting with Wednesday cough onset) in a structured bullet format, but abruptly stops after one day, omitting Thursday/Friday details, severity changes, fever, and other symptoms; thus partially relevant with no off-topic content."
