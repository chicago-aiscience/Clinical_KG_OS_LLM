  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer provides accurate information that aligns with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the timeline (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, discovery after soreness) and accurately compares engorgement levels between episodes. However, it is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence, which affects its correctness score slightly.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the Gold Answer's key points. It addresses the basic timeline and partial comparison of engorgement but omits: (1) uncertainty about when tick attached, (2) hope it came from hiking not garden, (3) specific location (Strathroy), (4) tick in plastic container detail, (5) 72-hour attachment estimate, (6) complete symptom comparison including bullseye rash presence/absence, (7) localized redness and tenderness details, (8) the 'little grape' analogy confirmation. The answer appears to be cut off mid-thought.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is faithful to the transcript. All claims made are verifiable: hiking Friday/gardening Saturday (P-1), soreness behind knee (P-1), tick in plastic container (P-1), comparison to prior tick 10 years ago (P-3), current tick less engorged than previous (P-3, P-4, D-4), and the 'small bug vs swollen grape' comparison (D-4). No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's two main components: (1) timeline of tick exposure and (2) comparison to prior episode. However, it provides only partial information on both topics and cuts off before completing the symptom comparison. The content that is present is highly relevant to the question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately addresses the question's timeline and comparison elements but is significantly incomplete, appearing to be cut off mid-sentence. While factually correct and faithful to the source material, it covers only 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer, omitting critical details about timing uncertainty, location, the 72-hour estimate, and complete symptom comparisons including the bullseye rash. The incomplete nature substantially limits its clinical utility despite accurate content."
