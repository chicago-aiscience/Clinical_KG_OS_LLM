  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core facts from D-37 accurately: listening to heart and lungs, physical exam, consulting with supervising doctor, and discussing next steps. However, it misses the initial framing from D-1 that established this process at the consultation's start, and doesn't note that this was explicitly stated to be 'at the end of the consultation' or that the patient agreed. The facts stated are correct but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of the Gold Answer's key points. It includes: (1) heart and lung auscultation, (2) physical exam, (3) consulting with supervising physician, and (4) returning to discuss next steps. However, it omits: (1) the initial framing from D-1, (2) the collaborative review process details ('go over everything you talked about'), (3) patient agreement (P-37), (4) the learner/trainee context, (5) the fact that no diagnosis or treatment was provided at this stage, and (6) the specific phrase 'where to go from here' that emphasizes the open-ended nature of next steps.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in D-37. The answer accurately reflects what the doctor said without adding fabricated details or hallucinating information. The paraphrasing is faithful to the source material, though condensed.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: what physical examination was specified (heart and lungs, physical exam), and what process for determining next steps (consult with supervising doctor, return to discuss). It stays focused on the plan stated at the end of consultation without tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and highly relevant, correctly identifying the physical examination components (heart/lung auscultation and quick physical exam) and the consultation process with a supervising physician. All stated information is verifiable in the transcript (D-37). However, it lacks the depth and context of the Gold Answer, missing the initial framing (D-1), the collaborative review details, patient agreement, and the contextual note about this being a trainee consultation. The answer covers the essential points but would benefit from more complete coverage of the consultation's structure and context."
