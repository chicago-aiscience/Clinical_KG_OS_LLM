  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition ruled out, accurately quotes the mother's statements from P-28 about prior workup and absence of shortness of breath and wheezing even during physical activity, matching the Gold Answer's core facts without any factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: asthma as condition (✓), ruled out despite family history (implied via P-28 context), mother's citations of no shortness of breath/wheezing even with physical activity (✓), prior workup (✓). Missed: explicit mention of grandparents as family history source, doctor's acknowledgment (D-28/D-30), patient's overall healthy history (P-24), and conclusion 'he doesn't have that'. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in P-28 ('grandparents had asthma, worked up for that, doesn't get short of breath or wheezing... even with physical activity'); citations accurate (P-28); no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by naming asthma and specifying the exact symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing) not exhibited even during physical activity, as cited by the mother, with no off-topic content."
