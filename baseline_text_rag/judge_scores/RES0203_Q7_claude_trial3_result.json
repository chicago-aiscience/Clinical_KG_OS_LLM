  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and provides no factual information to evaluate against the Gold Answer. It only contains the beginning of a sentence ('the patient reports that the loss of smell,') without any actual content about symptom development, timing, or progression.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to address: (1) simultaneous onset of all three symptoms, (2) two-day duration, (3) consistent progression without worsening, (4) partial nature of sensory losses, (5) no prior similar episodes, or (6) clinical significance of the pattern.",
    "faithfulness": "Cannot properly assess faithfulness as the Generated Answer contains no substantive claims to verify against the transcript. The fragment that exists ('the patient reports that the loss of smell,') is not inaccurate but provides no meaningful information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. The question asks for a comprehensive description of symptom development over time, including onset timing, progression, fluctuations, and prior history. The incomplete fragment provides none of this information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and non-functional, consisting only of a sentence fragment that provides no meaningful information. It fails to address any aspect of the question regarding symptom development, timing, progression, or prior history. All evaluation dimensions score 1 as the response contains no substantive content to evaluate against the comprehensive Gold Answer that thoroughly describes the simultaneous onset, consistent progression, and novel nature of the patient's symptoms."
