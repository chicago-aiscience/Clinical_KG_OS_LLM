  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnostic tests (chest X-ray, COVID swab), the physical exam, and the self-isolation instructions regarding the patient's wife, all of which align with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. It misses the timeline for results (24-48 hours), the source of further instructions (public health nurse), and the criteria for hospital admission (based on test results). Additionally, the response is truncated mid-sentence at the end.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements made in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. There are no hallucinations present.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question but fails to address several specific sub-questions (timeline, source, and criteria), providing only a partial response."
