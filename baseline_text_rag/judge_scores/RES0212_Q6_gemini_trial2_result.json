  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately captures the doctor's plan and the initial parts of the summary assessment based on the transcript and Gold Answer. However, the sentence cuts off abruptly ('brings up'), preventing a full evaluation of the facts in the latter half of the assessment. The facts present are fully consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The response is significantly incomplete. It covers the stated plan (reviewing the story with other doctors) and about half of the summary assessment (duration and nighttime awakening). It fails to complete the description of the sputum (greenish, no blood), misses the mention of constitutional symptoms, and entirely omits the third part of the question regarding what information would guide the next steps (the supervising physician's review).",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is directly supported by the transcript (specifically D-47). There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant to the question but fails to provide a comprehensive answer due to the truncation. It addresses the first part of the multi-part question but leaves the final part unanswered."
