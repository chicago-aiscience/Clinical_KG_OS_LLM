  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer (“Based”) does not report any of the patient’s symptoms (persistent cough, resolved sore throat/runny nose/early mucus, ongoing dry cough, chest soreness with coughing, or the pertinent negatives). Since it provides no substantive clinical content to compare with the Gold Answer, it fails to give a correct answer to the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points missed: persistent 2-week cough; early productive whitish/clear mucus for 4–5 days then dry cough; sore throat 2–3 days; runny nose/flu-like symptoms resolved in 3–4 days; current cough frequency ~3–4 times/hour; spontaneous triggers; stable intensity/frequency; chest soreness with coughing; explicit denials (no dyspnea, fever, N/V, abdominal pain). The Generated Answer includes none of these.",
    "faithfulness": "No clinical claims are made, so there are no hallucinated or transcript-inconsistent statements to penalize. However, it also does not demonstrate grounding by referencing any transcript-derived content.",
    "relevance": "The response does not address the question asking for specific resolved and ongoing symptoms during the two-week illness."
