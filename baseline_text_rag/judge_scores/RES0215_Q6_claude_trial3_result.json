  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core plan (physical exam, consult physician, discuss next steps) but provides an incomplete environmental assessment. It only mentions air filters [D-57] while omitting smoking status [D-53], carpets [P-54], pets [P-55], and wood-burning appliances [D-56]. The core facts are correct but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers approximately 50-60% of the key points. It correctly identifies the three-step plan from [D-58] but provides only 1 out of 5 environmental factors assessed (air filters only, missing smoking, carpets, pets, wood-burning appliances). It also omits the offer for questions [P-58] and housing context [P-49-50].",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The physical exam plan and environmental assessment of air filters are accurately cited from [D-58] and [D-57] respectively. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the immediate next steps plan and environmental factors assessed. The content is focused and relevant, though incomplete in coverage of environmental factors."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's three-step plan (physical exam, physician consultation, and follow-up discussion) and is fully faithful to the transcript with accurate citations. However, it significantly understates the environmental assessment by mentioning only air filters while omitting four other factors (smoking, carpets, pets, wood-burning appliances) that were thoroughly evaluated. The answer achieves good relevance and faithfulness but suffers from incomplete coverage of the environmental factors component."
