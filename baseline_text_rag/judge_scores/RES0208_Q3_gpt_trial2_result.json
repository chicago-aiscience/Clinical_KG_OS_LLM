  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: general infection evidence = fevers + fatigue + muscle aches; COVID-not-ruled-out features = difficulty breathing plus emerging sore throat and cough. Generated answer incorrectly includes difficulty breathing as evidence of the general infectious process and omits difficulty breathing from the COVID-specific set. It correctly includes fevers, fatigue, muscle aches for infection and sore throat + cough for COVID concern, but the key respiratory symptom is misclassified/missing in the COVID rationale.",
    "completeness": "Included: fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (infection layer); sore throat and cough (COVID layer). Missed/incorrect: difficulty breathing should be part of the COVID-not-ruled-out rationale (and is not part of the constitutional symptom triad the doctor cites as infection evidence). Also omitted the nuance from the gold answer that loss of taste/smell was elicited but not explicitly cited by the doctor in D-36 (minor but part of the gold response).",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms mentioned (fever, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) are present in D-36 and thus grounded in the transcript. The main issue is interpretation/categorization rather than invented content; no clear hallucinated symptoms.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the two-part question about which symptoms supported a general infection vs which led the doctor to not rule out COVID; no notable tangents."

  "summary": "Mostly grounded and relevant, but it misassigns shortness of breath to the general-infection evidence and fails to include it among the COVID-not-ruled-out symptoms, reducing correctness and completeness."
