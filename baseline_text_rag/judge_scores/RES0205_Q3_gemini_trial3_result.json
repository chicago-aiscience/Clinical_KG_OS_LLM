{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis (COVID-19), the patient's occupation (hospital worker), the social evidence (alarmed colleagues), and the test result (negative). The core facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly less detailed than the Gold Answer. It misses the specific 'flu-like symptoms' (sore throat, runny nose) mentioned in both the prompt and the Gold Answer as evidence for investigation. It also omits the timing of the test (two weeks ago) and the patient's current status (staying home).",
    "faithfulness": "The content is grounded in the transcript; however, the citations consistently use 'D-35' (the doctor's turn) instead of 'P-35' (the patient's turn) or 'P-34' (for the clerk detail). This is a minor labeling error in the citations but the facts are present in that section of the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question (diagnosis, evidence, and results) without including extraneous information."
