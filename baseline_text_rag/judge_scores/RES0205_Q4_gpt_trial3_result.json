  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and states it was ruled out via a COVID test with a negative result (supported by P-35). It correctly places the test at symptom onset about two weeks prior (P-36). The workplace concern mentioned (coworkers being scared when the patient coughs and wanting to return without coughing) is consistent with P-35 and P-36. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Includes: (1) condition ruled out (COVID-19), (2) test used (COVID test), (3) timing (at onset, ~2 weeks ago), (4) one key workplace concern (coworkers scared; wants to return without coughing). Misses additional workplace-related context emphasized in the Gold Answer: the patient works at a hospital (clerk) and the related heightened infection-control implications (including PPE mention), plus that they’ve been staying home waiting to improve and the occupational/social pressure driving the need for exclusion/medication.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (P-35, P-36). No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all components of the question (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns). Minimal extraneous content."
