  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s recap in D-58: 3–4 days of dry cough, a little bit of fever, headache, no sputum, no asthma, and no sick contacts except the brother with a cold ~2 weeks prior. It also correctly captures Jessica’s stated goal in P-60 (whether she needs medicine). No contradictions with the Gold Answer were introduced. The only notable issue is omission (medication recap and P-61 rest), not incorrect statements.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) 3–4 day dry cough, (2) fever, (3) headache, (4) no sputum, (5) no asthma, (6) no sick contacts except brother with cold 2 weeks ago, (7) Jessica’s goal: whether she needs medicine. Missed from Gold Answer: (a) doctor’s recap that she’s not taking meds aside from Claritin, (b) explicit framing/confirmation of the visit purpose as “next steps/where to go from here,” and (c) Jessica’s additional comment in P-61 about wanting to go home and lie down (symptom impact/rest priority).",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are directly supported by the transcript (D-58 and P-60). No extra, non-evidenced clinical findings or goals were added. The answer is well-grounded, with the main limitation being what it leaves out rather than hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question: the doctor’s key recap findings and Jessica’s primary goal regarding next steps. No tangential content."

  "summary": "The response is accurate, well-grounded, and focused, but slightly incomplete because it omits the Claritin/medication recap, the explicit “next steps” framing, and Jessica’s additional desire to go home and rest."
