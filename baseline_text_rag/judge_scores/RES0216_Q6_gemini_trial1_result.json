  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the doctor's assessment regarding asthma being the top differential and cardiac ischemia being less likely, which is fully consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer is severely incomplete. It covers the assessment portion but cuts off mid-sentence, missing the physical examination (listening to lungs), the proposed treatment (rescue puffers), the contingency approach (stepwise reassessment), and the consultation with the supervising physician. It covers approximately 20% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made regarding the assessment are accurately grounded in the transcript (specifically D-35 and D-36). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer starts to address the question but fails to provide the majority of the requested clinical plan, examination components, and contingency details due to being truncated."
