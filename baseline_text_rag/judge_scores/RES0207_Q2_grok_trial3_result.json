  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies Keppra as the medication (matching Gold [P-23]) and correctly describes the missed dose circumstance as the daughter's birthday celebration altering the dinner routine (matching Gold [P-24]). It does not contradict any facts in the Gold Answer, though it omits the explicit link to epilepsy as the chronic condition (Gold [P-8, P-23]). Core facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: Keppra prescription [P-23]; daughter's birthday celebration as circumstance [P-24]; usual timing with dinner and change due to early celebration. Missed: explicit naming of epilepsy as chronic condition [P-8, P-23]; patient linking missed dose to seizure [P-9]; doctor's acknowledgment of isolated lapse [D-24, D-25]. Covers core answer (medication and main circumstance) but ~80% of Gold's detailed points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Keppra in [P-23]; birthday celebration, early event, usual dinner timing, forgetting due to no later dinner in [P-24]. Citations accurate. No hallucinated details; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by naming the medication (Keppra) for the chronic condition (implied epilepsy) and specifying the exact circumstance (daughter's birthday changing dinner routine). Concise, no off-topic content."
