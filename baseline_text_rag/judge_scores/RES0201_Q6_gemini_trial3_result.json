{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the gold answer regarding the diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), the initial isolation instruction (isolate until results are back), and the condition for continued isolation (symptom persistence despite a negative result).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most of the key points but misses the doctor's explicit assessment phrasing that the symptoms were 'in line with common symptoms of COVID-19'. It also excludes the contextual mention of consulting a supervising physician and the specific rationale for the chest X-ray mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript, specifically section [D-43]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the specific components of the question (tests, isolation, and conditions) without including irrelevant information."
