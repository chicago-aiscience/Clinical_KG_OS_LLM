  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as a “cardiac ischemic picture” (D-36). The supporting findings it lists—chest tightness rather than pain (supported by P-1/P-5), “didn't really get out of breath with exercise” (D-36), and “no pain associated with it” (D-36/P-5)—are consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer. No clear factual contradictions are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) condition lowered: cardiac ischemic picture; (2) chest complaint nature: tightness not pain; (3) less consistent exertional dyspnea pattern (doctor said not really out of breath with exercise); (4) pertinent negatives: denied anxiety, sweating, feeling of impending doom (P-6), in addition to no pain. The Generated Answer includes (1), (2), (3), and repeats no pain, but omits the other explicitly screened absent symptoms (anxiety/sweating/impending doom). Because the question explicitly asks for the absence of certain symptoms, this is a major omission.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript (D-36, P-1/P-5). The answer does not add unsupported symptoms or diagnoses. Minor citation imprecision (uses P-1 for 'tightness rather than pain' instead of the more explicit P-5) but still grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements (condition placed lower and symptom-based rationale). However, it does not fully address the 'absence of certain symptoms' portion beyond pain, making it only mostly responsive to the question."

  "summary": "Accurately identifies cardiac ischemia as lower on the differential and cites appropriate chest-tightness/no-pain and exertional dyspnea reasoning, but misses key pertinent negatives (no anxiety/sweating/impending doom) required by the question."
