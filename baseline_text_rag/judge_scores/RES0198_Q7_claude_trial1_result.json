  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states that 'Information regarding whether the symptoms were constant or intermittent was not found in the provided excerpts as the patient did not answer this question (D-8).' However, in P-8, the patient clearly states 'It's been pretty constant for the past week,' directly answering D-8. This is a major omission of factual information present in the transcript. The other facts mentioned (week duration, stuffy first, now mostly running) are correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: (1) week duration, (2) stuffy nose first, and (3) transition to mostly running. However, it completely misses: (1) the patient's clarification about constant vs. intermittent symptoms (P-8), (2) the initial 'on and off' description in P-1, (3) the role of decongestants in the symptom transition, (4) that symptoms had not improved, and (5) the chronological detail that symptoms persisted continuously throughout the week. The Generated Answer also incorrectly claims information about constant/intermittent pattern is missing.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer has a major faithfulness issue. It claims the patient 'did not answer this question (D-8)' when in fact P-8 explicitly contains the patient's answer: 'It's been pretty constant for the past week.' This represents a failure to accurately represent what is in the transcript. The other claims are grounded in the transcript (week duration in P-1/P-2, stuffy first in P-3, mostly running now in P-3), but the false claim about missing information is a significant problem.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's three main components: onset timeframe (week), which symptom appeared first (stuffy), and progression (to mostly running). However, it fails to properly address whether symptoms were constant or intermittent, claiming this information is missing when it is actually present. The answer stays focused on nasal symptoms and chronology as requested, but the incomplete treatment of the constant/intermittent aspect reduces its relevance to the full question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the week-long duration and the progression from stuffy to runny nose, but contains a critical error by claiming the patient did not answer whether symptoms were constant or intermittent, when P-8 clearly states they were 'pretty constant.' This represents both a factual error and a faithfulness issue. The answer misses approximately half of the key details present in the Gold Answer, including the 'on and off' initial description, the role of decongestants, and the lack of improvement. While the response stays focused on the relevant nasal symptoms and chronology, the significant omissions and the false claim about missing information substantially limit its quality."
