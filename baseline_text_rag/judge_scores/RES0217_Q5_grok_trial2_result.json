  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's inference of tick attachment exceeding 72 hours based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening activities, directly from [D-6], and the use of the Lyme map for Strathroy's risk [D-13], matching all core facts in the Gold Answer without errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: activities (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday) contributing to >72h estimate [D-6]; Strathroy on map as concerning for prophylactic antibiotics [D-13]. Missed details: patient's uncertainty on attachment timing [P-1], removal 'earlier today' [D-1/P-1], doctor's comment on time since outdoors [D-2], 'along the creek' [P-12], covers ~85% of Gold's specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly grounded in transcript: activities and >72h from [D-6], map assessment from [D-12/D-13]; citations accurate (D-5 contextual to D-6, D-12/D-13 precise); no hallucinations or unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses both parts of the question—how activities led to >72h estimate and map's role in justifying prophylaxis—with no extraneous content."
