  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered/ruled out and accurately reports the mother’s cited negatives: no shortness of breath and no wheezing, including with physical activity. No statements contradict the Gold Answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) asthma was the condition, (2) mother states he’s been worked up for it, (3) no shortness of breath, (4) no wheeze, even with physical activity. Key point missed relative to the question/Gold Answer: explicit mention that the family history was in the grandparents (grandparents had asthma). It also omits the additional distinguishing context from P-24 (pretty healthy otherwise/never had a dry cough like this), though that is secondary to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by P-28. No hallucinated findings or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what condition was ruled out and what clinical negatives (including during activity) were cited. Minimal/no extraneous content."
