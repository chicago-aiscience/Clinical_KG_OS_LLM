  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is essentially empty/incomplete (it stops after “Based on the transcript excerpts, the doctor assessed”) and does not provide any of the factual elements required by the question or present in the Gold Answer (COVID-consistent symptoms, swab test, isolation guidance, timeline, possible further tests, consult with supervising physician). Because it fails to state the assessment/plan, it cannot be considered factually correct relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Misses all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) assessment that symptoms are consistent with COVID, (2) COVID test via swab and method of collection, (3) self-isolation instructions including potentially continuing even if negative while symptomatic, (4) results timeline of 1–2 days, (5) mention of possible additional tests and possible further questions, (6) plan to review with supervising physician, and (7) reassurance/next steps. Coverage is effectively 0%.",
    "faithfulness": "No substantive claims are made, so there are no hallucinated details. However, the response is truncated and provides no transcript-grounded content beyond an unfinished lead-in.",
    "relevance": "The answer does not actually address the question (overall assessment and management plan, tests, instructions, timeline, follow-up, supervising physician). It is an incomplete fragment."
