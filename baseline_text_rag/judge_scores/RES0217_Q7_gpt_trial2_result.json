  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The statements included are consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer: she was hiking Friday and gardening Saturday before noticing soreness behind the left knee and finding/removing the tick and bringing it in a plastic container (P-1). The comparison that the current tick was less engorged than the prior one and was small (P-3, P-4) aligns with Gold; the “small bug vs grape” framing is taken from the clinician’s description (D-4) and is not contradicted. No clear factual errors are present in what was written, though the answer is cut off mid-sentence.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) hiking Friday and gardening Saturday; (2) noticed soreness behind knee and found tick; (3) brought tick in plastic container; (4) current tick less engorged than prior.\nKey points missed: (1) uncertainty about when she acquired it and hope it was from hiking not gardening; (2) discovery was “earlier today”; (3) specific location detail (behind left knee crease/joint); (4) doctor’s estimate that attachment could be >72 hours; (5) prior episode details: bullseye/target rash and antibiotics; (6) current episode local symptoms: localized redness/tenderness and explicitly no bullseye/larger circle rash; (7) explicit contrast that prior tick was “quite swollen” vs current “maybe a little bit” engorged and “pretty small.” Overall, <50% of key content is included and the symptoms comparison is incomplete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are grounded in the transcript (P-1, P-3, P-4, D-4). No invented facts (e.g., no added symptoms, timing, or geography beyond what was stated).",
    "relevance": "The answer stays on the asked topics (timeline and comparison to prior tick bite), but it is incomplete (cuts off during the symptoms comparison) and omits several timeline elements and the prior bullseye/antibiotic history that are central to the question. Thus it only partially addresses the question."
