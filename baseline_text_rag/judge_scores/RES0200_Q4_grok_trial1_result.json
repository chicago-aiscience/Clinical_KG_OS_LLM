{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID (equivalent to COVID-19 in Gold), symptom overlap as the reason, COVID swab as the test, and 24-48 hours as turnaround time, matching all key facts in the Gold Answer; minor informality in 'Covid' vs 'COVID-19' and extra citation to D-53 (which is not substantive) do not introduce errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: alternative diagnosis (COVID/Covid), reason (symptom overlap), test (COVID swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours); Gold's additional details on symptoms and citation are elaborative but not essential query points, so 100% coverage of core elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] ('symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid', 'covid swab', '24 to 48 hours'); citation to D-52 accurate, D-53 irrelevant but harmless and not hallucinatory; no fabricated content.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time) with no off-topic content."
