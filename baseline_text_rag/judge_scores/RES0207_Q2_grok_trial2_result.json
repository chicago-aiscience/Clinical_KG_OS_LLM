  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies Keppra as the medication from [P-23], consistent with the Gold Answer. The circumstance of missing the dose due to the daughter's birthday celebration altering the dinner routine is precisely matched in [P-24], aligning fully with the Gold and transcript facts. No factual errors or contradictions; the epilepsy condition is implied by context though not explicitly restated.",
    "completeness": "Covered: Medication (Keppra [P-23]), specific circumstance (daughter's birthday celebration earlier, changing dinner time [P-24]). Missed from Gold: Explicit mention of epilepsy as chronic condition [P-8, P-22], reference to forgetting med and seizure link [P-9], doctor's acknowledgment of common lapse [D-25], confirmation of isolated incident [D-24]. Covers core key points (med and circumstance) but omits ~20% of elaborative details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Keppra from [P-23]; missed dose details (birthday, celebration earlier, usual dinner time) exactly from [P-24]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question: names the medication for the chronic condition and details the exact circumstance for the missed dose, with no off-topic content."
