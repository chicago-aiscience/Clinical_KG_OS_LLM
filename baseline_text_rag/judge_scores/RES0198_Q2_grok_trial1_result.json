  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient tried decongestants (matching Gold's 'decongestants' from P-10) and assessed it as working 'a little bit' (directly from P-10). It also correctly notes the doctor's recommendation of Tylenol Cold (from D-39). However, it omits the nuanced ambiguity in the patient's assessment (transition from stuffy to runny) and additional supportive care details like hydration and symptom duration expectations, leading to minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) Patient tried OTC decongestants [P-10]; covered. 2) Assessment ambiguous/'worked a little bit' with reasoning on nose changing; partially covered (misses reasoning). 3) Doctor recommended hydration and OTC like Tylenol Cold [D-39]; partially covered (Tylenol only, misses hydration). 4) Viral illness takes weeks, supportive care only [D-39]; not covered. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable: 'decongestants' and 'worked a little bit' in P-10; 'Tylenol cold' in D-39. Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question (medication tried, effectiveness assessment, doctor's OTC recommendation) with no off-topic content."
