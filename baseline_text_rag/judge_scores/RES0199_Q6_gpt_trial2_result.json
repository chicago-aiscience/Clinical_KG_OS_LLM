  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the management plan stated in [D-52]: COVID-19 swab, isolate 14 days, contact tracing if positive, and supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). No statements contradict the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: COVID swab; 14-day isolation; contact tracing if positive; supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, antipyretics/Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches).\nKey elements missed: the expected test result timeframe (“about 24–48 hours”); the explicit note that if not COVID it could be another viral illness; and the explicit framing that management is supportive regardless of result (though supportive care is listed).",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are directly supported by [D-52]. No hallucinated medications, tests, or instructions are introduced. The answer does omit some transcript details but does not add unverifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested components of the management plan (test, isolation duration, contact tracing trigger, supportive care). No irrelevant tangents."
