  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the stated plan in D-37: (1) listen to the heart and lungs and do a quick physical exam, then (2) consult with the doctor they are working with, and (3) return to discuss next steps. There are no statements that contradict the Gold Answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: auscultation of heart and lungs; quick physical exam; consult/review with supervising doctor; return to discuss next steps. \nKey Gold Answer points missed: the plan being foreshadowed earlier in D-1; explicit wording about \"go over everything you talked about\" (though implied by \"review symptoms\"); the patient’s explicit agreement (P-37); and the note that no diagnosis/medications were provided at this stage. Given the question focus, the missing items are mostly contextual rather than core, but still reduce completeness somewhat.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in D-37 and consistent with the transcript. No hallucinated exam components, diagnoses, or treatments are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses what the doctor planned to do (exam components) and the described process for deciding next steps (consult supervisor, then return to discuss). No irrelevant content."
