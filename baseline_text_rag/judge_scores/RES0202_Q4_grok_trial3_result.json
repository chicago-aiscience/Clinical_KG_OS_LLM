  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition and fever as the specific clinical finding excluding it, matching the Gold Answer's core facts from [D-45] with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: condition (asthma), scenario for addition (just cough or shortness of breath without fever), exclusion due to fever, citations [D-45]. Missed: specific temperature details [P-1, P-2], supporting findings (no wheezing [P-7], uncertain SOB [P-8]), doctor's conclusion of infection, nuance that asthma is not permanently ruled out. Covers core answer (80-99%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from [D-45] ('if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath... and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma' and 'right now it sounds like an infection'), citations accurate, no hallucination or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers the question by naming the condition (asthma) and specific finding (fever) with precise transcript reference, no off-topic content."
