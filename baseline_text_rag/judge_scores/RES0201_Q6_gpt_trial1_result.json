  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All statements in the Generated Answer align with the transcript and the Gold Answer: it correctly identifies the planned COVID swab and chest X-ray, correctly states isolation until results return, and correctly notes continued isolation may be required even with a negative test if symptoms persist. No factual contradictions or added incorrect details are present.",
    "completeness": "It covers the key management elements asked for: (1) diagnostic tests (COVID swab, chest X-ray), (2) isolation until results, and (3) continued isolation if still symptomatic despite a negative result. However, it does not explicitly state the clinician’s overall assessment that the symptoms are \"in line with common symptoms of COVID-19\" (the rationale for the plan), which is included in the Gold Answer and is part of the question prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are directly supported by D-43 and do not introduce extraneous or invented information. The answer stays within what is stated in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested elements (assessment/plan, tests, isolation instructions, and condition for continued isolation) with no tangential content."
