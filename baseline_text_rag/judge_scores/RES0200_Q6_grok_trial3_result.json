  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab), imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (oxygen saturation), and one therapeutic intervention (supplemental oxygen) as stated in the Gold Answer and directly from [D-52], with no factual errors or contradictions in the information provided.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs, COVID swab) - all covered; imaging (chest X-ray) - covered; monitoring (oxygen saturation and supplemental oxygen if needed) - covered; therapeutics (continuation of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen) - only supplemental oxygen covered, misses bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics; additional BP monitoring - missed. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer (labs, imaging, O2 sat, supplemental O2) are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured precisely to address the question's requested categories (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics) and focuses exclusively on the doctor's management plan from the transcript, with no off-topic content."
