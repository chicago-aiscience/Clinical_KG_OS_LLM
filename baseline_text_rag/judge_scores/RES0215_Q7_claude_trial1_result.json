  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incomplete - it only contains a fragment ('Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient's respiratory symptoms developed as follows') with no actual content. It provides none of the factual information present in the Gold Answer about the symptom development, initial trigger, fluctuating pattern, cough emergence, or nocturnal episode. This makes it impossible to assess correctness meaningfully, as there are no facts to verify.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the Gold Answer's key points. It fails to mention: (1) the 4-5 day timeline, (2) physical activity (playing tag) as the initial trigger, (3) initial symptoms of wheezing and difficulty breathing, (4) the fluctuating episodic pattern with resolution at rest, (5) the later emergence of a dry cough, (6) the single nocturnal episode with difficulty falling asleep, or (7) any pertinent negatives like no fever or cyanosis. The answer is essentially non-existent.",
    "faithfulness": "Since the Generated Answer contains no substantive claims beyond an introductory phrase, there is nothing to evaluate for faithfulness to the transcript. The fragment present is technically accurate (it correctly indicates the answer will be based on transcript excerpts) but provides no clinical information that could be verified or falsified against the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question in any meaningful way. While the introductory fragment suggests an intention to discuss symptom development, no actual information about how symptoms developed, changed, or progressed is provided. The question specifically asks about initial trigger, fluctuating patterns, cough emergence, and nocturnal episodes - none of which are addressed."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incomplete, consisting only of an introductory fragment with no substantive content. It fails to provide any information about the patient's respiratory symptom development, initial triggers, fluctuating patterns, cough emergence, or nocturnal episodes. With 0% coverage of key points from the Gold Answer and no addressable clinical content, this response does not meet any criteria for a useful clinical evaluation."
