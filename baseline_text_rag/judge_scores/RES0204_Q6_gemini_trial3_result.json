  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main diagnostic tests (COVID swab and X-ray) and the consultation/follow-up process described in the transcript. It uses the doctor's lay description of an X-ray ('picture of the inside of the body') which is factually correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses the initial physical examination (listening to heart and lungs) which was part of the doctor's explicit plan in [D-1]. It also omits the specific clinical term 'chest X-ray' found in [D-37], though it describes it. It covers the consultation and the return visit accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited (D-1, D-39, D-40). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request for diagnostic tests, consultation details, and follow-up steps without including irrelevant information."
