  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the hiking on Friday and gardening on Saturday from P-1, soreness behind the knee leading to discovery, bringing the tick in a container (P-1), and the comparison of tick engorgement (current smaller/not as swollen vs. prior swollen, citing P-3 and D-4 correctly). No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer or transcript; all stated facts are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, soreness leading to discovery behind knee, tick removal and container (P-1); engorgement comparison (current small/not grape-like vs. prior swollen, P-3/D-4). Missed: uncertainty of attachment timing and hope it was from hiking not garden (P-1), specific left knee crease location (P-1/D-1), doctor's >72-hour estimate (D-6), prior episode details (bullseye rash and antibiotics explicitly contrasted, P-3), current symptoms (localized redness/tenderness without larger circle rash, P-6). Covers approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: timeline and container from P-1; engorgement from P-3 ('not as much', prior 'quite swollen') and D-4/P-4 ('pretty small', not grape-like). Citations P-1, P-3, D-4 accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question: timeline from hiking/gardening to discovery/presentation (first paragraph), and comparison of engorgement/symptoms to prior experience (bulleted section). Structured response focused on question; incomplete but no off-topic content."
