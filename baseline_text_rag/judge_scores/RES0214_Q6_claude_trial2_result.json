  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key facts from the Gold Answer: COVID-19 swab ordered, self-isolation for patient and husband, and physical exam as next step. However, it omits one important detail present in the Gold Answer - that the clinician would 'go talk to the Doctor' [D-55], indicating consultation with a supervising physician. This is a minor but relevant omission.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 80-85% of the Gold Answer's key points. It correctly identifies the COVID swab, self-isolation recommendation for both patient and husband, and the physical exam as next step. The mention of 'investigate/work up the symptoms further' is present but less detailed than the Gold Answer. The main missing element is the plan to consult the supervising physician [D-55] and the implication that this was a trainee encounter.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (D-53, D-54, D-52). No hallucinated information is present. The answer stays grounded in what was explicitly stated in the transcript without adding unsupported details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: specific test ordered (COVID swab), precautionary measures (self-isolation for patient and husband), and stated next steps (physical exam and further investigation). The response is well-organized and focused entirely on answering the question without irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-grounded response that covers most key elements of the management plan. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab, self-isolation recommendations, and physical exam plans with proper citations. However, it omits the clinician's plan to consult with the supervising physician (D-55), which represents a minor but relevant gap in completeness. The answer demonstrates excellent faithfulness to the source material and maintains strong relevance throughout."
