  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately states the missed Keppra dose due to birthday dinner disruption (matches P-24) and seizure connection implied by timing (P-8), with patient recognition via accurate paraphrase of P-9 quote; fully consistent with Gold's core facts on causality and recognition, minor interpretive paraphrase '[caused it]' aligns with Gold's 'trailing off but clearly attributing'.",
    "completeness": "Covers: missed dose reason (birthday dinner, P-24), causal connection implied, patient recognition via P-9 quote. Missed: explicit same-night timing (P-8), voluntary context in response to D-9 (not prompted by adherence Q), rarity of seizures ('usually don't get very often', P-9), no clinician confirmation, full citation details (P-8, P-24, D-9); covers ~60% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Keppra (P-23), birthday dinner forget (P-24), recognition quote/paraphrase (P-9), seizure prior night (P-8); no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both question parts (causal connection via missed dose explanation; patient recognition evidence with quote/citation); no tangents or off-topic content."
