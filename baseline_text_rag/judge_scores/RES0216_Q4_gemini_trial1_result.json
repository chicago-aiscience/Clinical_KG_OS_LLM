  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the doctor's explicit reasoning provided in the transcript (D-36). It correctly identifies 'cardiac ischemic pictures' as the deprioritized condition and accurately lists the reasons cited by the doctor: tightness vs. pain, lack of breathlessness with exercise, and the overall absence of pain.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but is slightly less comprehensive than the gold answer. Specifically, it misses the 'pertinent negatives' mentioned in the gold answer regarding associated cardiac red flags (anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom) which were screened in D-6. While the doctor did not repeat these in the final summary (D-36), the gold answer includes them as evidence cited during the clinical process.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript. The generated answer accurately cites specific dialogue turns (D-36, P-1) and does not include any hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and focuses solely on the question asked, addressing both the condition and the symptom findings cited by the clinician."
