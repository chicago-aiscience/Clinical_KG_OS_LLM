  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately states the test was negative. However, it contains a citation error - all citations reference 'D-35' when they should reference 'P-35' (patient statements, not doctor statements). The core facts align with the Gold Answer but lack the temporal detail about testing timing.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main required elements (diagnosis, evidence, results) but is significantly less complete than the Gold Answer. It omits key evidence details such as: flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose), timeline of test (two weeks ago at symptom onset), patient's PPE use, occupational exposure context, and post-test isolation period. Coverage is approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript but has citation errors. All content references 'D-35' when the information actually comes from P-35 and P-36. The facts themselves (hospital worker, colleague concern, negative COVID test) are verifiable in the transcript, but the citation inaccuracy represents a technical faithfulness issue. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated (COVID-19), what evidence prompted it (hospital worker, colleague alarm), and what testing revealed (negative). The response is focused and concise with no irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis with accurate test results, but contains systematic citation errors (referencing D-35 instead of P-35/P-36) and omits significant supporting details present in the Gold Answer, including symptom timeline, testing timing, and post-test isolation period. The response is highly relevant and factually accurate in content but lacks comprehensiveness."
