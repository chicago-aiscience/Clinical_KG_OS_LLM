  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is merely 'Based', providing no factual content or symptoms. It neither matches nor contradicts the Gold Answer's detailed reporting of symptoms, but offers zero accurate information, making it mostly incorrect by absence of required facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer (persistent cough, resolved: sore throat, runny nose, productive mucus, flu symptoms; current: dry cough details, frequency, triggers, stability, chest soreness; negatives: no SOB, fever, N/V, abd pain) are completely uncovered (0%).",
    "faithfulness": "No claims or content in Generated Answer to verify against transcript; it is effectively empty, not grounded, and lacks any basis in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The response 'Based' does not address the question about specific symptoms (resolved and current) in any way; entirely off-topic or non-responsive."
