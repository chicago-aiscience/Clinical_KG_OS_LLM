  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence. It only mentions seasonal allergies and recurrent viral infections, failing to address new carpets and cold weather sensitivity. It does not explain how these factors relate to exercise-induced wheezing. The Gold Answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how all four factors contribute to the clinical picture, while the Generated Answer merely lists two factors without analysis.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the Gold Answer's key points. It mentions only 2 of 4 risk factors (seasonal allergies and recurrent viral infections) and provides no explanation of their relationship to exercise-induced wheezing. Missing elements include: discussion of new carpets, cold weather sensitivity, atopic constitution, airway hyperresponsiveness, exercise-triggering mechanism, resolution with rest, environmental assessments (smoking, pets, stoves, air filters), and the integrative analysis showing how these factors collectively suggest hyperreactive airways.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is grounded in the transcript with accurate citations (D-35 for seasonal allergies, D-15 for recurrent viral infections). However, it's incomplete and doesn't hallucinate information. The citations are correct, though the answer is truncated before completing its thought.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer begins to address the question by identifying relevant factors but fails to explain how they relate to exercise-induced wheezing and respiratory distress. The truncated nature means it doesn't provide the analysis requested. It starts on-topic but doesn't deliver the synthesis needed to answer the question fully."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence after mentioning only 2 of 4 relevant risk factors without explaining their relationship to the patient's symptoms. While factually accurate for what it includes, it fails to address the question's core request for synthesis and analysis of how multiple factors collectively relate to exercise-induced wheezing. The Gold Answer provides comprehensive integration of all factors with mechanistic explanation, which the Generated Answer entirely lacks."
