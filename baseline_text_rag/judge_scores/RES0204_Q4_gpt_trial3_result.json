  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered and ruled out, consistent with the transcript (P-28) and Gold Answer. It accurately reports the mother’s cited pertinent negatives: no shortness of breath and no wheezing, even with physical activity (P-28). No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points: (1) asthma was considered/ruled out; (2) family history in grandparents; (3) patient previously “worked up” for asthma; (4) no shortness of breath; (5) no wheezing; (6) these symptoms absent even with physical activity; (7) mother’s conclusion he doesn’t have asthma; (8) patient otherwise healthy/never had this dry cough before (P-24).\n\nGenerated Answer includes (1), (3), (4), (5), (6). It omits (2) the explicit positive family history in grandparents, and does not include (7) the mother’s explicit conclusion or (8) the additional contextual negative history. Given the question explicitly asks about the positive grandparent history, that omission is important.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims (asthma, worked up, absence of shortness of breath/wheezing even with physical activity) are directly supported by P-28. No apparent hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "It addresses the core of the question (condition ruled out and supporting negative findings, including absence during activity). However, it fails to mention the explicitly requested context of a positive family history in the grandparents, reducing how directly it answers the full prompt."
