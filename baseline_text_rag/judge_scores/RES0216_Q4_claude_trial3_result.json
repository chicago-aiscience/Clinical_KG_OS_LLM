  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies 'cardiac ischemic pictures' as the condition placed lower on the differential and accurately cites the doctor's key evidence from D-36. The three bullet points align with the Gold Answer's main points: tightness vs pain, lack of classic exertional dyspnea, and absence of pain. However, it omits the important pertinent negatives (denial of anxiety, sweating, feeling of impending doom) that were explicitly screened by the clinician and mentioned in the Gold Answer. The patient's relief statement is also missing.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of the Gold Answer's key points. It captures the main condition (cardiac ischemic picture), the tightness vs pain distinction, and absence of pain. However, it misses several important elements: (1) the specific pertinent negatives screened by the clinician (anxiety, sweating, impending doom), (2) the nuanced discussion about difficulty getting a full breath despite the doctor's summary statement, (3) the patient's relief about it 'probably not being the heart', and (4) the organized structure showing two categories of evidence (nature of complaints vs absent symptoms).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The condition name comes from D-36, and each of the three bullet points can be traced to specific exchanges. The characterization of symptoms as 'tightness rather than pain' is supported by P-1 and P-5. The statements about not getting out of breath and having no pain are direct quotes or paraphrases from D-36. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying the specific condition deprioritized and citing symptom findings the doctor used as evidence. It focuses on both the nature of chest complaints (tightness vs pain) and absence of symptoms (no pain). The response stays on-topic throughout, though it could be more comprehensive in addressing all aspects of the question, particularly regarding 'certain symptoms' that were absent."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemic pictures as the deprioritized condition and accurately cites the main symptom evidence from the doctor's reasoning (tightness vs pain, lack of classic exertional dyspnea). All claims are verifiable in the transcript with no hallucinations. However, it omits important pertinent negatives (anxiety, sweating, impending doom) that were specifically screened and cited as evidence, covering only about 60-70% of the key points in the Gold Answer. The response is relevant and factually accurate but incomplete."
