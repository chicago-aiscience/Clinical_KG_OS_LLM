  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's stated plan from D-47 ('go review your story with the doctors') with no errors. The summary assessment paraphrases key elements from D-47 correctly (cough 'for a while' that 'became bad in the last three days,' wakes up at night, 'brings up' sputum), matching the Gold Answer's description without contradictions or fabrications, though it is truncated and omits details like 'greenish,' 'no blood,' and 'no constitutional symptoms.' Core facts are consistent, with only minor incompleteness as a discrepancy.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) detailed summary assessment (cough for ~3 months/'little while,' worsened last 3 days, nighttime awakening, greenish sputum no blood, no constitutional symptoms with implications); (2) stated plan to review story with doctors; (3) next steps guided by supervising physician's assessment (no tests/treatments mentioned); (4) patient's addition and doctor's response. Generated covers: full plan (100%); partial summary (duration, worsening, night waking, start of sputum mention ~40-50% of details); misses no blood/const symptoms/implications, next steps guidance, patient/doctor exchange. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in D-47: plan to 'review your story with the doctors'; assessment phrasing matches 'cough ... for a little while but it's only become bad in the last three days. You're waking up at night and you're kind of bringing up this ... greenish sputum.' Citation to D-47 accurate; no hallucinated facts, even in truncated form.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the question's elements (stated plan and summary assessment via bullets), citing transcript; remains focused without off-topic content, though truncation prevents full address of 'information guiding next steps.' Mostly relevant with no tangents."
