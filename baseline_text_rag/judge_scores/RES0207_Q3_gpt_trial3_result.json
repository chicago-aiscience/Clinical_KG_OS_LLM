  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient missed their anti-epileptic medication (Keppra) due to a disrupted routine around their daughter’s birthday/dinner timing (P-24) and links this missed dose to the seizure. It correctly cites the patient’s own attribution in P-9 (\"I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have yeah\"), reasonably paraphrased as implying causation. No contradictory or incorrect claims relative to the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) missed Keppra dose as the trigger for the seizure, (2) situational reason for missing the dose (daughter’s birthday/routine change), and (3) evidence that the patient recognized the causal link (P-9 statement). Key points missed from the Gold Answer: (a) that the patient offered this attribution spontaneously in response to a question about post-seizure issues rather than being directly asked about adherence (D-9/P-9), (b) the patient’s comment that seizures are usually infrequent, supporting that this seizure was unusual and likely precipitated (P-9), and (c) explicit note that the transcript contains no clinician confirmation of causality (the link is based on patient recognition).",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive statements are supported by the transcript (P-9, P-23, P-24). The bracketed \"[caused it]\" is an interpretive gloss rather than a verbatim quote, but it matches the clear intent of the patient’s statement and does not introduce new factual content. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: how the missed dose connects to the seizure and what conversational evidence shows the patient recognized the link. It stays on-topic."
