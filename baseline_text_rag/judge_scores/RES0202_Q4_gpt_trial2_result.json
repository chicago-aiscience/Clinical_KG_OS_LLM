  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition the doctor would have added to the differential if the child had only cough/shortness of breath without fever, and correctly identifies fever as the clinical finding that made the doctor favor an infectious process rather than asthma in the current workup. This matches the Gold Answer and the cited transcript statement in [D-45].",
    "completeness": "It includes the two core elements from the Gold Answer that are directly responsive to the question: (1) asthma as the added differential if the presentation differed, and (2) fever as the specific finding leading to exclusion from the current workup. It omits supporting context in the Gold Answer (e.g., specific reported temperatures, lack of wheeze/uncertain SOB, and nuance that asthma is not permanently ruled out), but these are not strictly required to answer the question as posed.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript, especially [D-45]. No additional unverifiable or invented details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what was asked (condition and specific finding leading to exclusion), with no tangents."
