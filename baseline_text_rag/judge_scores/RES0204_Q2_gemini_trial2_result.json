  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the two diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) and correctly states the rationale for the COVID swab as institutional protocol for patients with those symptoms, which is fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses the two main parts of the question but is significantly less detailed than the Gold Answer. It misses several key points included in the Gold Answer: the rationale/explanation for the chest X-ray ('get a better look', 'picture of the body'), the confirmation of the patient's medication status/history, the description of the swab's discomfort, and the mention of the supervising physician. It covers approximately 50% of the key points found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript with correct speaker citations (D-37, D-39). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and focused, directly answering the prompt's specific questions without any tangential information."
