  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key facts from the Gold Answer: COVID-19 swab ordered [D-53], self-isolation for patient and husband [D-53, D-54], and physical exam as next step [D-52]. It paraphrases 'investigate/work up further' [D-53] but omits the explicit consultation with the supervising doctor [D-55] and patient agreement [P-54], which are minor discrepancies while core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID swab, (2) self-isolation for patient/husband, (3) physical exam, (4) consult supervising doctor/return after. Generated covers 1-3 fully and partially 4 via 'investigate further'; misses patient agreement. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: swab and isolation [D-53], keep to self [D-54], physical exam [D-52], investigate [D-53]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured precisely around the question's elements (test ordered, precautionary measures for patient/husband, next steps), with no off-topic content."
