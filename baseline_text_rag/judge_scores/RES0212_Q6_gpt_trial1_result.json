  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "What is provided is consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer: the plan to “go review your story with the doctors” is accurate, and the partial assessment (“cough for a while… became bad in the last three days… wakes up at night”) matches D-47. However, the Generated Answer is truncated mid-sentence and does not include other elements of the doctor’s assessment (e.g., green sputum, no blood, no constitutional symptoms), so while not clearly wrong, it is only partially accurate relative to the full Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) stated plan to review with the doctors. Key elements missed: (1) greenish sputum and explicitly “no blood,” (2) explicit statement that there are no constitutional symptoms, (3) the patient’s added concern about exercise and doctor’s response (“We’ll see what we can do”), and (4) what would guide next steps (supervising physician review; no tests/treatments ordered at this point). Overall, well under half of required components are addressed.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly grounded in D-47 and do not introduce unsupported details. No hallucinations are present; the only issue is truncation/omission, not fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on the asked items (plan and assessment), but it fails to address the third part (what information would guide next steps) and provides only a partial assessment due to truncation. Still, it is on-topic."
