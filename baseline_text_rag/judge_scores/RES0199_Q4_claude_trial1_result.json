  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, the swab test ordered, the 24-48 hour turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness. All facts align with what the doctor stated in D-52.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main components requested in the question: (1) the condition to rule out (COVID-19), (2) the diagnostic test and turnaround time (swab, 24-48 hours), and (3) the alternative diagnosis (another viral illness). However, it omits several supporting details present in the Gold Answer, such as the 14-day isolation instruction, contact tracing procedures, reasoning for suspecting COVID-19 ('symptoms overlap'), and details about supportive management. Coverage is approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at D-52, with accurate citations provided. There is no hallucinated content. The answer is completely grounded in the source material and uses appropriate paraphrasing of the doctor's actual statements.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question without any off-topic content. It is focused and concise, providing exactly what was asked: the condition, the test with turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a correct, highly relevant, and fully grounded response to the clinical question. It accurately identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, specifies the swab test with 24-48 hour turnaround, and names the alternative viral illness diagnosis. While factually accurate and well-cited, it omits some contextual details from the Gold Answer such as isolation instructions and management approach, resulting in very good but not complete coverage of all available information."
