  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine (OTC antihistamine) for seasonal allergies and confirms no prescribed medications, which fully aligns with the key facts in the Gold Answer and transcript (P-36, P-47). No factual errors or contradictions; minor citation discrepancy (D-36/P-36, D-47) does not affect fact accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) no medications/treatments for current respiratory episodes (resolves on own, P-33/P-34); (2) occasional OTC Reactine for untested seasonal allergies (P-35/P-36); (3) explicitly no prescribed medications (P-36/P-46/P-47); (4) no antibiotics for past viral infections (P-16). Generated covers (2) partially (Reactine for allergies) and (3) fully, but misses (1) and (4) entirely (~50% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: seasonal allergies and Reactine at P-35/P-36; no prescribed/no regular meds at P-36/P-47. Citations reference adjacent doctor lines (D-36/D-47) but accurately point to the relevant exchange; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications for other conditions (allergies) and prescribed status; concise and focused on question without tangents or off-topic content, though brief on current episodes."
