  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incomplete, containing only the word 'Based' which provides no factual information whatsoever about the patient's symptoms. It neither aligns with nor contradicts the Gold Answer, but simply fails to provide any substantive content.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention any of the resolved symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, productive cough with mucus), any of the persistent symptoms (dry cough, frequency, triggers, chest soreness), or any of the pertinent negatives (difficulty breathing, fevers, nausea, abdominal pain).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains only the word 'Based' which cannot be evaluated for faithfulness to the transcript. There are no claims to verify, no citations, and no content that could be considered hallucinated or grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question in any meaningful way. The question asks for specific symptoms reported during the two-week illness, including both resolved and persistent symptoms. The word 'Based' provides no relevant information whatsoever."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is essentially non-existent, containing only the incomplete word 'Based' with no substantive content. It fails completely on all evaluation dimensions, providing no information about the patient's symptoms, covering none of the key points from the Gold Answer, and not addressing the clinical question in any way. This represents a complete failure to generate an appropriate response."
