  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the plan including COVID swab, chest imaging (correctly inferring X-ray from transcript descriptions), consultation with supervising physician, and follow-up discussion, matching the Gold Answer's facts; minor discrepancies include generalizing 'chest X-ray' to 'imaging/picture of inside body' and not specifying the initial physical exam of lungs/heart.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray/imaging), consultation with supervising physician, follow-up steps to discuss next steps; missed details include the initial plan structure (chat, listen to lungs/heart), age-appropriate explanations for tests, patient agreement, and concluding thanks, covering approximately 80-90% of Gold Answer's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript: COVID swab and imaging from D-37/D-39, consultation from D-1/D-37/D-40, follow-up from D-1/D-40; citations are accurate and no hallucinations present.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured with bullets directly addressing diagnostic tests, consultation, and follow-up steps as specified in the question, with no off-topic content."
