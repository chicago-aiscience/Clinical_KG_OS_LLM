  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete - it only contains the beginning phrase 'Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient's symptoms began' and then cuts off. Since there is essentially no content to evaluate for factual accuracy, it cannot be compared meaningfully to the Gold Answer which provides a comprehensive chronological progression. This represents a complete failure to answer the question.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) stuffy nose as first symptom, (2) sore throat development, (3) fever appearing after stuffy nose for 3 days, (4) muscle aches concurrent with fever (2-3 days), (5) husband's symptoms starting a week prior (approximately 4 days before patient's fever), and (6) the staggered onset pattern suggesting household transmission. The answer is essentially non-existent.",
    "faithfulness": "Cannot properly evaluate faithfulness since there is no substantive content in the Generated Answer. The opening phrase 'Based on the transcript excerpts' suggests an attempt to ground the response in source material, but no actual claims are made that could be verified or found to be hallucinated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. The question asks for a chronological progression of symptoms, which symptom appeared first, what followed, and comparison to husband's timeline. The incomplete fragment provides none of this information and is essentially a non-response."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and essentially non-existent, containing only an introductory phrase that cuts off mid-sentence. It fails to provide any of the required information about symptom chronology, progression, or comparison to the husband's timeline. This represents a complete failure to answer the clinical question, earning the minimum score across all evaluation dimensions."
