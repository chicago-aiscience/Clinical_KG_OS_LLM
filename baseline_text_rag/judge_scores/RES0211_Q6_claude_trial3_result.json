  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key clinical findings from D-58: three-to-four-day dry cough, fever, headache, no sputum production, no asthma, and the brother's cold two weeks ago. It correctly identifies Jessica's primary goal from P-60 as wanting to know if she needs medicine. However, it omits that Jessica is not taking medications aside from Claritin, which was explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer as part of the doctor's recap.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most major points from the Gold Answer but omits several details: (1) it doesn't mention that Jessica takes Claritin, (2) it doesn't include the statement about no one in recent close contact being sick, (3) it doesn't mention the doctor's framing of 'next steps and where to go from here,' and (4) it omits Jessica's secondary comment in P-61 about wanting to go home and lay down, which the Gold Answer highlighted as reflecting her malaise and desire for rest. Covers approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The summary accurately reflects D-58, and Jessica's goal is correctly cited from P-60. No hallucinated content is present. The answer stays grounded in the source material with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: what clinical findings the doctor recapped and what Jessica's primary goal was. It stays focused on these specific aspects without adding irrelevant information. The response is well-targeted to the question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and relevant response that correctly identifies the main clinical findings from the doctor's summary and Jessica's primary goal. It demonstrates strong factual accuracy and perfect faithfulness to the transcript. However, it lacks completeness by omitting several supporting details mentioned in the Gold Answer, including Jessica's Claritin use, the doctor's framing of next steps, and Jessica's desire to go home and rest (P-61), which adds context to her immediate priorities."
