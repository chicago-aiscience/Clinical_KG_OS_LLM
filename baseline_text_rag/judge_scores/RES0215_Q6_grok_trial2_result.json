  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the doctor's plan from [D-58] (physical exam, consult physician, return to see daughter and discuss next steps), which matches the Gold Answer's description of the three steps and notes no specific tests. It correctly identifies one environmental assessment (air filters, [D-57]/[P-57]). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer or transcript; all claims are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: Plan (3 steps: physical exam, consult physician, return/discuss) - fully covered; no specific tests named - implied/covered; offer to raise questions - missed; environmental factors (smoking [P-53], carpets [P-54], pets [P-55], wood-burning [P-56], air filters [P-57]) - only air filters covered (1/5); townhouse [P-50] and family [P-49] context - missed. Covers plan fully (~50% of answer) but only ~20% of environmental factors, overall ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: air filters question [D-57], full plan stated in [D-58]. Citations accurate (D-57, D-58). No hallucinated facts, additions, or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question (doctor's plan and home environmental factors assessed), with no irrelevant content, tangents, or off-topic information. Concise and focused."
