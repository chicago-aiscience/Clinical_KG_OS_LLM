  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer (“Based”) provides no symptom information, timelines, or resolved vs persistent symptoms. It therefore fails to deliver the specific symptom report required by the question and contained in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Misses essentially all key points from the Gold Answer: persistent 2-week cough; initial productive mucus (whitish/clear) then dry cough; sore throat and runny nose early and resolved; frequency (3–4x/hr), spontaneous nature, stable intensity/frequency; cough-related chest soreness; and the explicitly denied associated symptoms (fever, dyspnea, GI symptoms).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer makes no clinical claims beyond an incomplete fragment (“Based”), so there are no hallucinated or transcript-inconsistent statements to penalize. It is non-informative but not ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "Does not address the question asking for specific symptoms (resolved and ongoing)."
