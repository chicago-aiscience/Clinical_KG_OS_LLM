  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence after only stating 'Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient reports that the loss of smell,' without providing any actual information about symptom development. Since it provides no substantive content to evaluate against the Gold Answer, it contains no correct or incorrect facts.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to address: (1) when symptoms began (2 days prior), (2) simultaneous onset of all three symptoms, (3) consistency of symptoms without worsening or fluctuation, (4) partial nature of sensory losses, or (5) no prior similar episodes. The answer is literally incomplete as a sentence.",
    "faithfulness": "Since the Generated Answer provides no actual claims beyond an incomplete introductory phrase, there is nothing to evaluate for hallucination or grounding in the transcript. However, the severe incompleteness means it fails to faithfully represent the information available in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all due to its incompleteness. The question specifically asks for a description of symptom development timeline, relative onset, progression/fluctuation, and prior history - none of which are provided in the truncated response."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely deficient, consisting only of an incomplete introductory phrase that provides no substantive information. It fails to address any aspect of the question regarding symptom timeline, relative onset, progression, or prior history. All evaluation dimensions receive the lowest score due to the complete absence of meaningful content."
