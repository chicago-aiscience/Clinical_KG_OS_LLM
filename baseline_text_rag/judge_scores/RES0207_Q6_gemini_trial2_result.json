    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the content of the transcript and the core facts mentioned in the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the plan to consult another doctor and the mention of potential tests and next steps.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several nuances included in the Gold Answer: it does not mention the patient's agreement (P-37), the interpretation that the interviewer is likely a trainee/medical student, or the observation that no specific tests or treatments were actually ordered yet. It covers approximately 60% of the points detailed in the Gold Answer.",

    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses the question regarding the next steps, the participants in decision-making, and the types of follow-up mentioned."
