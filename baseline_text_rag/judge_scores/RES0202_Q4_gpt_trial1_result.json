  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition the doctor would have added if the presentation were different, and correctly identifies fever as the specific finding that led the doctor to deprioritize/exclude asthma from the current workup in favor of infection. This matches the Gold Answer and is consistent with [D-45].",
    "completeness": "It includes the two key elements required by the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) asthma would have been added if cough/SOB occurred without fever, and (2) fever was the finding that led the doctor to focus on infection rather than asthma. It does not include the additional supporting details mentioned in the Gold Answer (e.g., lack of wheeze, uncertainty about SOB, and nuance that asthma isn’t permanently ruled out), though these are not strictly required to answer the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript, specifically [D-45]. No additional or invented clinical details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question (condition + specific excluding finding) without tangents."
