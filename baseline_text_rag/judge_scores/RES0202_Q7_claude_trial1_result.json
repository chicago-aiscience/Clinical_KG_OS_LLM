  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence. It only mentions Wednesday's symptom (dry cough) and provides no information about Thursday or Friday. The Gold Answer details a clear three-day progression including Thursday's worsening cough and fatigue, and Friday's fever, decreased appetite, possible loss of taste, and runny nose. The Generated Answer contains no factual errors in what it does state, but it's essentially only providing 1/3 of the required information.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions only the Wednesday dry cough but completely omits: (1) Thursday's worsening cough and fatigue, (2) Friday's fever emergence with specific temperature readings, (3) Friday's decreased appetite and possible taste loss, (4) Friday's runny nose, (5) the stepwise progression summary, (6) the mother's correction about the three-day timeline, and (7) the context that the child appeared fine before symptoms started. The answer appears to be cut off mid-response.",
    "faithfulness": "What little content is provided is accurate to the transcript. The statement that the child seemed fine at school and developed a dry cough on Wednesday is verifiable in [P-1]. However, the response is so incomplete that it's difficult to fully assess faithfulness. There are no hallucinated facts, but the answer provides almost no substantive information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question by organizing information chronologically by day, which is directly relevant to what was asked. However, it only addresses the first few hours of a three-day progression. The question specifically asks for details about 'how the cough changed in severity over the three days' and 'when the fever and other new symptoms...emerged' - none of which are covered in this incomplete response."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete, appearing to cut off after only mentioning Wednesday's dry cough. While the limited information provided is factually accurate and attempts a relevant chronological structure, it covers less than 20% of the required content. It completely omits Thursday's symptoms and Friday's critical developments (fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, possible taste loss, runny nose). The answer fails to address the core question about how symptoms evolved and when new symptoms emerged over the three-day period."
