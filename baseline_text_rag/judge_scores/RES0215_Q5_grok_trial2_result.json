  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Generated Answer correctly identifies seasonal allergies (verifiable at P-35, though cited as D-35) and recurrent viral infections (verifiable at P-15, cited as D-15). It accurately notes wheezy episodes and shortness of breath during activity (P-3, P-6, P-41). No factual contradictions with Gold Answer, but citation labels are minorly inaccurate (D vs. P). Core facts match Gold, but lacks explanatory depth on relations.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) allergies indicate atopy/asthma [P-35/36], (2) virals trigger inflammation [P-15/16], (3) new carpets as irritant [P-54], (4) cold weather trigger [P-38], (5) other env factors [P-53-57], (6) exercise trigger/resolves rest [P-3/6/41], (7) collective hyperresponsiveness. Generated covers (1) partially, (2) partially, (6) partially; misses (3),(4),(5),(7). Covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: allergies near D-35/P-35, virals near D-15/P-15, symptoms during activity at P-3/P-41. No hallucinations. Citations inaccurate (D- instead of P-), but minor; content grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for collective relation of specific factors (allergies, virals, carpets, cold) to exercise-induced symptoms. Generated mentions allergies, virals, and activity-triggered symptoms but omits carpets/cold, no collective explanation or ties to wheezing/distress; partially relevant but incomplete."
