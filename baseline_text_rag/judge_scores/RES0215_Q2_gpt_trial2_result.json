  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the child sometimes takes Reactine for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications involved. These statements align with the transcript (mother: occasional Reactine/OTC meds and explicitly “no prescribed medications”). Minor issue: the answer cites speaker labels as D-36/D-47 rather than the parent lines (P-36/P-47), but the underlying facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "It captures two key elements from the Gold Answer: (1) intermittent Reactine for seasonal allergies and (2) no prescribed medications. It omits other key points: that nothing is given for the current wheeze/SOB episodes (they resolve with rest), that she has no regular medications aside from occasional Reactine, and the historical point that past viral infections did not require antibiotics. Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made are supported by the transcript (seasonal allergies treated sometimes with Reactine/OTC; no prescribed medications). However, the provided citations are not accurate to the transcript speaker tags (these are in the parent’s lines, not the doctor’s), which slightly weakens faithfulness/traceability.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about what medications/treatments she has been taking and whether any prescribed medication is part of management. It stays on-topic."
