  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states diagnosis at age 8 (matches Gold and transcript P-2, confirmed D-3) and baseline bronchodilator use once every two weeks (P-8). It accurately notes current cough 'almost nonstop' for past week (P-1) and shortness of breath (P-1). Minor discrepancy: says 'past week' while Gold/transcript clarifies 'last two weeks' (P-13), but core facts align with no contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: dx age 8/now 10 (2yr hx), baseline well-controlled (once/2wks, triggers exercise/cold/seasonal), 2wk exacerb (cough nonstop day, incr wheezing, SOB, chest tight, SABA 5-6x/wk, wheezing>SABA, nighttime sx, no precipitant). Covered: dx age 8, baseline use, current cough/SOB. Missed: current age/ hx duration, triggers/seasonal, dry cough nature, wheezing details/chest tight/nighttime, crucially current SABA use freq, wheezing>SABA, no infection. Covers ~20-30% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: dx from D-2/D-3/P-2, baseline use P-8, cough/SOB from P-1. Citations accurate (P-8, D-2/D-3). No hallucinations; minor phrasing 'very shortness of breath' paraphrases P-1 accurately. Truncation doesn't introduce fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly addresses question's evolution (dx, baseline use, current symptoms), staying focused on asthma symptoms/bronchodilator without off-topic content, though truncated before fully detailing exacerbation usage."
