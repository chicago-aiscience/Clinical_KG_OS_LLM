  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is truncated and does not make any substantive claims about timing, simultaneity, consistency/worsening, partial vs total loss, or prior history. Because it contains essentially no factual content, it does not contradict the Gold Answer, but it also fails to correctly state the key facts required by the question.",
    "completeness": "Misses essentially all key points from the Gold Answer: simultaneous onset ~2 days prior; cough started at same time; all symptoms remained consistent without worsening/fluctuation; partial (not total) smell/taste loss details; no prior similar episodes. Coverage is <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "No specific clinical claims are made beyond an introductory fragment, so there are no hallucinated details. What is present is consistent with the transcript, but it is not informative.",
    "relevance": "It begins to address symptom development (“patient reports…loss of smell”) but does not actually answer the question regarding relative onset, progression/fluctuation, or prior similar symptoms. Thus it is only minimally relevant."
