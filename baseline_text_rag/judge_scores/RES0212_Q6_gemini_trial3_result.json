  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The facts provided in the Generated Answer (plan to review with doctors, cough duration, worsening symptoms, and nighttime awakening) are all consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. There are no factual errors in the provided text.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. It fails to mention key parts of the assessment (greenish sputum, lack of blood, and lack of constitutional symptoms) because the sentence cuts off abruptly ('brings up'). Furthermore, it completely fails to address the third part of the prompt regarding what information would guide the next steps (the review with the supervising doctors).",
    "faithfulness": "The content is directly grounded in the transcript (D-47) and does not contain any hallucinations or fabricated information.",
    "relevance": "The answer starts by addressing the first two parts of the question but fails to provide a complete response due to the truncation and omission of the third requirement. It is only partially relevant/useful in its current state."
