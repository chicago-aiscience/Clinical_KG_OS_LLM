  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer does not provide any substantive clinical facts about onset, trigger, episodic pattern, cough development, or nocturnal symptoms. It also does not introduce incorrect statements that contradict the Gold Answer; it is essentially empty aside from a preface. Therefore, there are no clear factual errors, but it also does not demonstrate correct understanding of the timeline.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points all missing: (1) onset 4–5 days prior, (2) initial trigger with exertion (playing tag), (3) early wheeze and difficulty deep breaths, (4) fluctuating episodic pattern with resolution at rest and recurrence with activity, (5) new slight nonproductive cough, (6) single nocturnal wheezy episode with trouble falling asleep, (7) pertinent negatives (no fever, no cyanosis, otherwise well). Generated Answer covers none of these.",
    "faithfulness": "No clinical claims are made, so there are no hallucinations or unverifiable assertions. The only statement (“Based on the transcript…”) is consistent with the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The response does not actually answer the question (it provides only an introductory clause without describing symptom development)."
