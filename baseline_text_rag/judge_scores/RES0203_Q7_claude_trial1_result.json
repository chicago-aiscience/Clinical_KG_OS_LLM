  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence after 'the patient reports that the loss of smell,' and provides no actual information about symptom development, timing, progression, or prior history. Since it contains no substantive content to evaluate against the Gold Answer, it cannot be considered correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) simultaneous onset of all three symptoms, (2) two-day duration, (3) consistent severity without worsening, (4) partial nature of sensory losses, (5) no prior similar symptoms, or (6) the specific timing relationships between symptoms. The answer is essentially empty.",
    "faithfulness": "The incomplete fragment 'the patient reports that the loss of smell' is technically grounded in the transcript (patient does report loss of smell in P-1), but since the answer is cut off, there is no substantive content to evaluate for hallucination. The minimal text present does not introduce fabricated information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. The question asks for a comprehensive description of symptom timeline, progression, fluctuation, and prior history. The incomplete sentence fragment provides none of this information and is essentially non-responsive to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and non-responsive, cutting off after an introductory phrase without providing any substantive information about symptom development, timing, progression, or prior history. It fails to address any aspect of the question comprehensively and covers none of the key points present in the Gold Answer."
