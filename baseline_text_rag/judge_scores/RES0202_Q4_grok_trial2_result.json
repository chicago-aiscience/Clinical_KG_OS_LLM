  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition and fever as the specific clinical finding excluding it, matching the Gold Answer's core facts from [D-45]. No factual errors or contradictions; minor details like exact temperature values and supporting findings (no wheezing/SOB) are omitted but not required for accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Covered: condition (asthma), hypothetical presentation (cough/SOB without fever), excluding finding (fever), direct citations [D-45]. Missed: specific temperature details (100.1-101°F), supporting evidence (no wheezing [P-7], uncertain SOB [P-8]), nuance that asthma not permanently ruled out, and full quote concluding 'sounds like an infection'. Covers ~85% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-45] of transcript: exact phrasing on asthma addition if no fever/just cough/SOB, exclusion due to current presentation sounding like infection. Citations accurate; no hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers the question by naming the condition (asthma) and specific finding (fever), with precise transcript references; no off-topic content."
