  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three key symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, mild dry cough) that match the Gold Answer. It accurately quotes the doctor's connection to COVID-19 from D-39 and specifies the swab test from D-39. All stated facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript, with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covered: combination of symptoms (loss of smell, taste, dry cough), doctor's explicit connection via D-39 quote, specific test (swab). Missed: patient's initial COVID concern (P-1), confirmation of absent symptoms (fever P-10, difficulty breathing P-11, sore throat P-13, chest pain P-22), 'pretty well' summary (D-16), narrow symptom profile supporting decision, self-isolation emphasis (D-39). Covers core elements but ~50-60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript: symptoms described in P-1/P-4/P-7 (citations to D-1/D-5 are proximate and accurate enough), D-39 quote exact, swab test from D-39. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by specifying the symptom combination, explaining the doctor's connection (via quote), and identifying the test method (swab), with no off-topic content."
