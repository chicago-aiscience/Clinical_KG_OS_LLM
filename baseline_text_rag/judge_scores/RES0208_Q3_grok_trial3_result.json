  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer specifies 'fevers and fatigue and muscle aches' strictly for general infectious process. Generated includes 'difficulty breathing' here, contradicting Gold's categorization where it is part of additional COVID-concerning symptoms. Gold lists additional as 'difficulty breathing' + 'sore throat and cough'; Generated omits 'difficulty breathing' from additional and only lists 'sore throat and cough'. This represents significant discrepancies in symptom attribution matching Gold's analysis of D-36.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) general infectious - fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (fully covered); (2) additional distinct for COVID - difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough (partially: sore throat and cough covered, difficulty breathing missed and misgrouped); (3) notes that taste/smell not cited in assessment, respiratory focus (not covered). Covers ~70% of core symptom points but misses key separation and inclusion of difficulty breathing in additional. Score 3 (50-79%).",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms (fevers from P-4, fatigue from P-1/P-2, muscle aches from P-20, difficulty breathing from P-1/P-3, sore throat from P-9, cough from P-7/P-8) verifiable in transcript and cited in D-36 summary. Citation to D-36 accurate. Minor interpretive stretch claiming 'difficulty breathing' as part of 'general infectious process' since transcript structures it post-comma as 'and then the difficulty breathing... and then sore throat and cough', but no outright hallucination. Score 4.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the two categories from the question (general infectious symptoms and additional for COVID), cites D-36, and focuses on doctor's assessment without tangents. Perfectly on-topic. Score 5."
