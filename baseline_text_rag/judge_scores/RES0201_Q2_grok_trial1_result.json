  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the patient's mild COPD, current use of a long-acting beta agonist (cited P-28), and self-treatment attempts with salt water gargling and painkillers (cited P-6). These facts are fully consistent with both the Gold Answer and transcript, with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: mild COPD [P-27 implied], long-acting beta agonist [P-28], self-treatment with salt water gargle and painkillers [P-6]. Missed: vitamins [P-30], confirmation these are the only medications [D-29, D-30], no allergies [P-31], no relief from self-treatments ('nothing seems to be working' [P-6]), no other therapies, substance use history (smoking cessation [P-34, P-35], alcohol [P-36], no cannabis/other drugs [P-37, P-38]). Covers approximately 40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (P-28 for medication, P-6 for self-treatments). No hallucinated or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by listing ongoing prescription for chronic COPD management and self-treatments attempted for sore throat, with no off-topic content."
