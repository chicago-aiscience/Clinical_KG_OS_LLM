  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory inhalers (Ventolin/Ventilin and Spiriva), correctly reports Ventolin use as ~10 times in the past week, and correctly states the patient stopped a diuretic (blood pressure medication) without physician approval. No statements directly contradict the Gold Answer. However, it omits the non-respiratory medication atorvastatin, which does not make the included statements incorrect but does leave out a required element.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) Ventolin and Spiriva as pre-visit inhalers, (2) Ventolin use ~10 times in the past week, (3) discontinued medication = diuretic/BP med stopped without doctor approval. Missed: (1) the non-respiratory medication atorvastatin (\"Torva Staten\") for high cholesterol, and related confirmation/context present in the Gold Answer (e.g., it being for cholesterol).",
    "faithfulness": "All included clinical claims are supported by the transcript (Ventolin/Spiriva mentioned by the patient; Ventolin ~10 times; stopping diuretic without asking doctor). The main issue is inaccurate referencing: the inhalers are stated in P-11 (not D-11), and the count is in P-12 (not D-12). These are citation/attribution errors rather than major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked items (current meds, Ventolin frequency, and self-discontinued medication). It does not add irrelevant material, but it does not fully answer the 'non-respiratory drugs' portion."
