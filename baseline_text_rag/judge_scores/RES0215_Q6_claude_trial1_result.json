  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually correct but incomplete. It accurately identifies the physical exam, consultation, and follow-up discussion mentioned in D-58, and correctly notes the air filter question in D-57. However, it omits several environmental factors that were assessed (smoking, carpets, pets, wood-burning appliances) and doesn't mention the full scope of the plan or the mother's opportunity to ask questions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It identifies the three-step plan and one environmental factor (air filters), but misses: the smoking assessment, new carpets detail, pets inquiry, wood-burning appliance check, the mother's opportunity to ask questions, and the family living situation context. The answer captures the core structure but lacks substantial detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The air filter question appears in D-57, and the three-step plan (physical exam, physician consultation, follow-up discussion) is explicitly stated in D-58. No hallucinated content is present, though the answer is selective in what it includes.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the immediate next steps and environmental factors assessed. However, it provides minimal detail on environmental factors (only mentioning air filters) when the question specifically asked about 'environmental factors' (plural), suggesting a more comprehensive response was expected."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and faithfully grounded in the transcript but significantly incomplete. It correctly identifies the three-step plan (physical exam, consultation, follow-up) and mentions one environmental factor (air filters), but omits multiple other environmental assessments (smoking, carpets, pets, wood-burning appliances) that were conducted. The response is relevant and contains no hallucinations, but its brevity and lack of detail result in coverage of less than half the key points from the Gold Answer."
