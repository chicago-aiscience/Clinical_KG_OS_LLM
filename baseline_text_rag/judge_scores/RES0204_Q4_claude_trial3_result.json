  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition considered and ruled out, correctly cites the family history in grandparents, and accurately lists the key clinical findings (no shortness of breath, no wheezing, and absence of symptoms even with physical activity). All facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the core elements: the condition (asthma), family history (grandparents), and key symptoms the patient does NOT exhibit (shortness of breath, wheezing, even with physical activity). However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the patient being 'worked up for that' meaning prior evaluation, the mother's definitive conclusion 'he doesn't have that,' and the distinction from chronic asthmatic patterns. Covers approximately 70-75% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at P-28. The answer accurately cites the citation (P-28) and does not introduce any information not found in the source material. No hallucinations detected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: identifies the respiratory condition (asthma), confirms it was ruled out, mentions the positive family history (grandparents), and specifies the clinical findings including symptoms NOT exhibited during physical activity. Completely focused on the question with no irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and highly relevant, correctly identifying asthma as the ruled-out condition and citing the key negative clinical findings (no shortness of breath, no wheezing, even with physical activity) from the transcript. All information is faithfully grounded in the source material with accurate citation. However, it lacks some contextual details and elaboration present in the Gold Answer, such as the prior workup, the mother's definitive statement, and broader clinical context, resulting in moderate completeness."
