  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the medication (Keppra), the reason for the missed dose (birthday/routine change), and the specific family history (mother).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary risk factors (medication non-adherence and heredity). However, it omits a few nuances present in the gold answer, such as the patient's explicit acknowledgement that the missed dose likely caused the seizure [P-9] and the fact that the patient's seizures are normally infrequent/well-controlled when on medication.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript. There are no hallucinations or external information introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the risk factors for the episode and the relevance of the family history to the diagnosis."
