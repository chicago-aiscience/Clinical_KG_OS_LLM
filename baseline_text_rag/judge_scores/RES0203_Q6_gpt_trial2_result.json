  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and does not provide any substantive assessment or plan details to compare against the Gold Answer (no mention of COVID-consistent symptoms, swab test, isolation, result timeline, additional tests, or supervising physician consultation). Since it contains essentially no clinical content, it fails to match the Gold Answer on factual points.",
    "completeness": "It covers none of the required key elements from the Gold Answer: no overall assessment, no COVID swab test (including collection method), no self-isolation instructions, no expected 1–2 day result timeline, no mention of potential additional tests/follow-up questions, and no plan to review with a supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The only statement present ('Based on the transcript excerpts, the doctor assessed') is non-specific and does not introduce any unverifiable or fabricated clinical claims. There are no hallucinated details; it simply stops before providing content.",
    "relevance": "While it appears to begin answering the question, it does not actually address what the doctor’s assessment and management plan were. It therefore does not meaningfully respond to the prompt."
