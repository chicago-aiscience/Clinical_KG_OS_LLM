{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemic pictures) and the three specific points the doctor explicitly mentioned in the summary statement [D-36]: tightness vs pain, lack of breathlessness during exercise, and the absence of associated pain. These facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a significant portion of the 'absence of certain symptoms' requested by the prompt and detailed in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention that the doctor screened for and the patient denied anxiety, sweating, or a feeling of impending doom [D-6]. While it covers the points mentioned in the final summary [D-36], it omits these other 'pertinent negatives' that the Gold Answer includes as key evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically referencing statements made in P-1 and D-36. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's questions regarding the condition and the evidence for deprioritizing it."
