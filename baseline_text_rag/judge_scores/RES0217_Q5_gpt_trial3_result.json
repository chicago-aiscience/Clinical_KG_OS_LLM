  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the Friday hiking and Saturday gardening were used to infer an attachment duration >72 hours and that this supported prophylactic antibiotics, consistent with D-6. It also correctly states the doctor referenced the Ontario Lyme distribution map and judged Strathroy as “close enough” to be concerning, consistent with D-13. Minor issues: it cites D-5 for the >72-hour inference (D-5 is about deer tick description), and it implies D-12 supports the map reasoning (the location is provided in P-12, while D-12 is the physician’s question). These are citation/attribution errors rather than major factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) hiking Friday + gardening Saturday used to estimate prolonged attachment; (2) doctor’s explicit conclusion of >72 hours; (3) Strathroy identified and then checked against Ontario Lyme distribution map; (4) map-based concern used to justify antibiotics. Key details missed: the patient’s uncertainty about when the tick attached (“I don’t really know when I got it” P-1), that she removed it earlier today (D-1), and the doctor’s intermediate statement about time since last outdoors to noticing it (D-2).",
    "faithfulness": "The main claims are supported by the transcript (D-6 for >72 hours/prophylaxis; D-13 for map-based concern and moving forward with antibiotics). However, there are multiple inaccurate citations: D-5 does not support the attachment-duration inference, and D-12 is not the source of the Strathroy exposure detail (P-12 is). No clear hallucinated clinical facts beyond these misattributions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (duration inference from Friday/Saturday outdoor exposure and map-based geographic justification for prophylaxis) without extraneous material."
