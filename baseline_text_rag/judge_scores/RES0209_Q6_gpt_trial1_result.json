  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript’s stated actions: doing a COVID swab (D-29), considering a medication change to improve asthma control (D-43), and going to speak with “the doctor” and returning shortly (D-43). The only mild issue is labeling the doctor as the “supervising physician,” which is a reasonable inference from context (trainee presenting to a doctor) but not explicitly stated verbatim.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: (1) COVID swab/testing, (2) suggestion of medication change, (3) going to talk to the doctor and returning shortly.\nMissed/underdeveloped key points from the Gold Answer: (a) the clinician’s explicit goal that the patient should be able to play sports without needing medication each time (D-42), (b) the explicit trainee/presentation framing (“tell him/her everything you said”) and earlier statement about asking more questions before talking to the doctor (D-29), which supports the supervising-physician context.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements about COVID swab, medication change, and returning after speaking to the doctor are directly grounded in D-29 and D-43. The term “supervising physician” is not directly stated, but is a minor extrapolation rather than a clear hallucination; otherwise the answer stays close to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested elements: the diagnostic test in the COVID context, the proposed medication-regimen change, and the plan to consult the doctor and return."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and well-focused, but it omits several contextual plan details emphasized in the Gold Answer (sports-control goal and trainee/presentation framing), and slightly infers “supervising physician” beyond the transcript’s exact wording."
