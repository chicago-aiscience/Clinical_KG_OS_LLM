  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis to exclude, correctly states that a COVID swab was ordered, and correctly reports the expected turnaround time of 24–48 hours. These align with the Gold Answer and the transcript (D-52).",
    "completeness": "It includes all required elements from the Gold Answer: (1) alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), (2) specific test (COVID swab), and (3) turnaround time (24–48 hours). No key requested component is missing.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is grounded in the transcript (D-52). However, it cites D-53 as support for the turnaround time, but D-53 does not contain that information (it’s just a closing remark). This is a minor citation/grounding issue; the substantive claims remain supported by D-52.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question with no extraneous information."
