  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medication (Keppra) and accurately describes the circumstances surrounding the missed dose (daughter's birthday celebration, change in dinner routine) as stated in the transcript and the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary questions (medication and circumstance) but omits several key points present in the gold answer: it does not explicitly name the chronic condition (epilepsy), it does not mention that the missed dose likely led to the patient's seizure, and it omits the doctor's context regarding the nature of the lapse. It covers approximately 60% of the information detailed in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript with accurate citations for the medication [P-23] and the explanation for the missed dose [P-24].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and concise, focusing strictly on the specific questions asked without including extraneous details."
