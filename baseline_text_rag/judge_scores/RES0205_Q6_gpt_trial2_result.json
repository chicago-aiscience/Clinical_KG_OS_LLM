  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated plan in D-37: (1) listen to heart and lungs, (2) do a quick physical exam, (3) consult with the doctor they are working with, and (4) return to discuss next steps. No statements contradict the Gold Answer, and the wording is consistent with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: auscultation of heart/lungs; quick physical exam; consult with supervising/working-with physician; review what was discussed; return to discuss next steps. Key points missed: the plan being foreshadowed earlier in D-1; the patient’s agreement at P-37; and the Gold Answer’s explicit note that no diagnosis/medication was provided at this stage and that the transcript ends before findings/treatment are shared. Overall, it captures the core plan but omits several contextual elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by D-37 (and consistent with D-1 conceptually). No hallucinated exam components or additional steps were introduced. The answer does not add unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by stating the physical exam components and the described process for determining next steps. No irrelevant content."
