    "correctness": "The generated answer is an incomplete sentence and provides no factual information at all, failing to identify any symptoms or timelines mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The response misses 100% of the key points, including the initial symptom (stuffy nose), the subsequent symptoms (fever, sore throat, muscle aches), the specific durations (3 days for fever), and the comparison to the husband's timeline (1 week).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains no claims to verify, as it cuts off after an introductory phrase. It fails to ground itself in the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer does not address the question in any capacity; it is a sentence fragment that stops before providing a relevant response."
