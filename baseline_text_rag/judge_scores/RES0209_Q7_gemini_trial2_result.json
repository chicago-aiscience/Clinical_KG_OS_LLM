  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the age of diagnosis (8) and the baseline usage frequency (once every two weeks). It mentions a 'past week' for the cough, which aligns with the patient's initial statement (P-1), though it fails to include the later clarification of 'two weeks' (P-13) noted in the Gold Answer. The facts provided are consistent with the transcript but very limited.",
    "completeness": "The answer is highly incomplete. It covers only the initial diagnosis and baseline usage. It misses the specific current usage frequency (5-6 times per week), the duration clarification (2 weeks), various symptoms (chest tightness, nighttime symptoms), triggers, and the observation that wheezing occurs more often than medication use. Crucially, the text terminates abruptly mid-sentence ('and whe').",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the source transcript. There are no hallucinations, but the truncation of the response makes it impossible to verify the final incomplete claim.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it fails to address the full scope of the question, particularly the evolution to the 'near-daily use five to six times per week' which was explicitly asked for in the prompt. The premature termination further reduces its relevance as a clinical summary or response. It does not provide the requested 'evolution' in its entirety.
