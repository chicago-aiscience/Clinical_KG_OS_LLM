  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, correctly names the COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and accurately states the 24-48 hour turnaround time. All facts align with the Gold Answer and the transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three required elements from the question: alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), specific test (COVID swab), and turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, it lacks the contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as which specific symptoms overlapped (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) and the exact wording from the doctor. It provides the essential information but is less comprehensive than the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The COVID diagnosis exclusion, COVID swab test, and 24-48 hour timeframe are all explicitly stated in [D-52]. The citation references (D-52, D-53) are accurate, though D-53 is unnecessary as it only contains acknowledgment. No hallucinated information is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question without any irrelevant information. It stays focused on what was asked: the alternative diagnosis, the diagnostic test, and the turnaround time."
