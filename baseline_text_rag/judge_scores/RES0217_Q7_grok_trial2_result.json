  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts align fully with the Gold Answer: hiking on Friday and gardening on Saturday (P-1), noticing soreness behind the knee leading to tick discovery (P-1), removal and bringing the tick in a plastic container (P-1), prior experience ~10 years ago (P-3), current tick less engorged/small bug-like vs. prior swollen (P-3, P-4, D-4), not grape-like (D-4). No discrepancies, errors, or contradictions in stated content.",
    "completeness": "Covered: hiking Friday (P-1), gardening Saturday (P-1), soreness behind knee prompting discovery (P-1), tick removal and presentation with container (P-1), prior ~10 years ago, engorgement contrast (current smaller/less swollen/not grape vs. prior swollen, P-3/D-4). Missed: Strathroy location (P-12), uncertainty/hope it was from hiking not garden (P-1), 'earlier today' discovery (P-1), precise location (left knee crease/joint, P-1/D-1), doctor's >72-hour estimate (D-6), prior bullseye rash/antibiotics details (P-3), current only local red/tender no larger rash (P-6). Symptoms comparison initiated but truncated. Covers ~60% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: P-1 (timeline, soreness, container), P-3 (prior bite, engorgement comparison), D-4/P-4 (tick size/engorgement). No hallucinated facts, unverifiable details, or fabrications; truncation does not introduce errors.",
    "relevance": "Answer focuses directly on question: timeline from hiking/gardening to discovery/presentation, and comparison of engorgement/symptoms to prior (engorgement detailed, symptoms started). No off-topic content or tangents."
