  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All core facts align with the Gold Answer and are verifiable in the transcript at [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key components of the question (alternative diagnosis, diagnostic test, turnaround time) but lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific quote from the doctor explaining the symptom overlap, the mention of specific overlapping symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, chills), and the fuller clinical context. It covers approximately 70-75% of the informational depth.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in segment [D-52]. The answer provides accurate citations (D-52, D-53) and contains no hallucinated information. Everything stated can be traced back to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question without tangential information. It is concise and focused, providing exactly what was asked: the alternative diagnosis (COVID), the test ordered (COVID swab), and the turnaround time (24-48 hours)."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies all three required elements (COVID as alternative diagnosis, COVID swab as test, 24-48 hours turnaround) with correct citations from the transcript. While factually complete and highly relevant, it provides less contextual detail than the Gold Answer, such as specific overlapping symptoms and fuller quotes from the doctor's explanation. The response is entirely faithful to the source material with no hallucinations."
