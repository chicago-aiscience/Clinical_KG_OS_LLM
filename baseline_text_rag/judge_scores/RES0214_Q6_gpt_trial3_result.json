  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All stated elements match the Gold Answer and transcript: COVID swab ordered (D-53), self-isolation for patient and husband (D-53) with “keep to yourself” reinforcement (D-54), and plan to proceed to a physical exam (D-52). The added phrase about “investigate/work up further” is consistent with D-53 and does not introduce an error. No contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) COVID swab, (2) self-isolation for patient and husband, (3) physical exam as next step. Misses: the explicit next step of consulting the supervising/attending physician and returning (“I’m going to go talk to the Doctor and I’ll be coming back in…” D-55), and does not note the patient’s agreement. Because the question asks for the overall plan including next steps before concluding the encounter, omission of the D-55 consult/return is a meaningful gap.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are grounded in the transcript with correct references (D-52, D-53, D-54). No hallucinated tests or recommendations. Minor generalization (“investigate/work up further”) is supported by D-53 and remains faithful.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question components (test ordered, precautions, next steps). No substantial irrelevant content."
