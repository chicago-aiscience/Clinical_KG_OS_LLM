  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states that the information is not found in the provided excerpts. This is factually incorrect: the transcript explicitly includes OTC medications tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and a routine supplement (multivitamin), along with their lack of effectiveness.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Tylenol tried for chest pain and ineffective, (2) Advil tried and ineffective, (3) Alka-Seltzer tried and ineffective, (4) daily multivitamin as only regular supplement/medication. The Generated Answer includes none of these, so it misses essentially all required content.",
    "faithfulness": "The only substantive claim is that the information is not present in the excerpts. That claim is not supported by the transcript (it is directly contradicted by P-6 and P-25). No additional hallucinated medications are introduced, but the response is still not grounded because it asserts absence where clear evidence exists.",
    "relevance": "The response is nominally aimed at the question (it addresses whether the information is available), but it fails to provide the requested medications/supplements and effectiveness. Thus it is only partially responsive."
