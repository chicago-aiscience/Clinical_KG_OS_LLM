  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The items the Generated Answer does mention (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab, chest X‑ray, oxygen saturation monitoring, and supplemental oxygen if needed) are consistent with the plan stated in [D-52]. It does not introduce incorrect tests or treatments. However, it presents an incomplete therapeutic list under a heading implying comprehensiveness.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key elements: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs; COVID swab; chest X-ray; oxygen saturation monitoring (and oxygen PRN); continuation of bronchodilators; systemic steroids; antibiotics; and (additionally) blood pressure monitoring mentioned in [D-37].\nGenerated Answer includes: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab; chest X-ray; oxygen saturation measurement; supplemental oxygen PRN.\nMissing: continuation of bronchodilators, systemic steroids, antibiotics, and the additional BP monitoring note from [D-37]. Given the question explicitly asks for these therapeutic interventions, the omission is substantial.",
    "faithfulness": "All included elements are directly supported by the transcript ([D-52]); no clear hallucinated tests, imaging, monitoring, or therapies are added. The answer is truncated after the therapy section but what is present is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic (management plan for COPD exacerbation: labs, imaging, monitoring, therapies). There are no tangents, but it fails to address several items explicitly requested (steroids/antibiotics/bronchodilator continuation), reducing how well it serves the question."
