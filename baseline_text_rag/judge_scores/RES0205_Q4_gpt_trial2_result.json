  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition, correctly states a COVID test was used, and correctly places the test timing at symptom onset about two weeks prior. The workplace concern it mentions (coworkers being scared when the patient coughs, and wanting to return without coughing) is consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. No factual contradictions noted.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) COVID-19 ruled out, (2) COVID test used, (3) test done at onset ~2 weeks prior, (4) coworkers scared by coughing, (5) desire to return to work without coughing. Missed/understated: the fact the patient works in a hospital setting (clerk) and the associated infection-control/high-risk context, including the patient’s mention of PPE use; also omitted that the patient has been staying home awaiting symptom resolution and the linkage to needing clearance/comfort returning to a hospital workplace. Overall coverage is partial relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (P-35, P-36). No added speculative details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the question (condition, test, timing, and workplace-related concerns), though the workplace-concern portion is not fully elaborated."
