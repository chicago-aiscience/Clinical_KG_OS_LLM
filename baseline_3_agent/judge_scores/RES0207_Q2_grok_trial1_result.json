  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication for epilepsy, matching the Gold Answer's core fact from [P-23] and context [P-8, P-22]. It accurately notes the patient forgot the dose [P-9], consistent with Gold. However, it lacks the specific details of the daughter's birthday celebration, change in dinner routine, and family event as the precise trigger [P-24], representing a minor discrepancy in factual depth but no outright errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Keppra for epilepsy [P-23, P-8]; (2) forgot med [P-9]; (3) specific circumstance - daughter's birthday celebration earlier, did things differently, no usual dinner, completely forgot [P-24]; (4) doctor acknowledgment of common lapse [D-25, D-24]; (5) link to seizure [P-9]. Covered: (1) and (2). Missed: (3), (4), (5). Covers ~30-40% of key points, primarily the medication and general forgetting but not the detailed circumstance central to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: Keppra at [P-23], epilepsy history at [P-8, P-22], forgetting dose at [P-9]. Citations are accurate. No hallucinated facts or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the medication for the chronic condition (epilepsy) and mentions missing a dose due to forgetting, aligning with the question. However, it provides only a vague circumstance ('forgot') instead of the specific event, with no irrelevant content or tangents."
