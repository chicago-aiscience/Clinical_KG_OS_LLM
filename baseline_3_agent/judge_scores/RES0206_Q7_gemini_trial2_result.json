  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (increased cough, sputum, hemoptysis, and dyspnea) and the 3-day timeline. However, it incorrectly attributes information to a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source. It also fails to explicitly state the patient's direct comparison that this is her 'worst' episode, instead using vaguer language about it exceeding her baseline rather than comparing it directly to the severity of prior exacerbations.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the gold answer: 1) Specific baseline metrics like rescue inhaler frequency (once every two weeks) and the ability to walk the dog daily. 2) The specific impact of the exacerbation on her exercise tolerance (dog walks being 'trickier'). 3) The mention of a possible fever. 4) The patient's explicit statement that this is the 'worst' episode she's had. 5) The clear comparison to prior ER visits where she was not hospitalized to establish relative severity.",
    "faithfulness": "Most of the clinical information is found in the transcript. However, the generated answer hallucinations references to a 'knowledge graph' and uses external tags like [SYMPTOM] and [D-43], which were not present in the provided context as sources of metadata. It also infers severity based on potential future admission rather than the patient's provided history.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the three components of the prompt: evolution, trend, and comparative severity, though the comparison is less detailed than the gold standard."
