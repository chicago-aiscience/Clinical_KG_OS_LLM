  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety/stress-related chest pain as the diagnosis, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it uses the term 'Functional Chest Pain' which is less precise than the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' The core factual content is accurate.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of the key supporting observations from the Gold Answer. It addresses: (1) academic stress/thesis pressure, (2) history of anxiety attacks, (3) somatic manifestations/breathing changes, and (4) patient's own attribution to stress. However, it significantly omits critical observations including: the situational pattern (pain when alone vs. resolving with distraction/social interaction), the specific walking/studying alone pattern, pertinent negatives (no fever, no exertional worsening, pain at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety, no asthma), and recent stress about potential anxiety attack recurrence.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer appropriately references specific patient statements [P-15], [P-13], [P-21], [P-3], [P-6], [P-19], and [P-8]. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by identifying the diagnosis and providing supporting clinical observations. It stays focused on the core question without tangential content. The structure appropriately organizes observations under clear headings that explain the reasoning."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety/stress-related chest pain and provides accurate, well-cited supporting evidence. However, it misses several critical clinical observations present in the Gold Answer, particularly the distinctive situational pattern (symptoms when alone, resolution with distraction) and important pertinent negatives that help rule out cardiac/pulmonary pathology. The answer demonstrates strong factual accuracy and relevance but lacks the comprehensive coverage expected for a complete clinical assessment."
