  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly lists positive symptoms (fevers, fatigue, etc.) instead of the denied symptoms listed in the Gold Answer (runny nose, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling). It falsely claims no explicit evidence of denials in the transcript, contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate citations (e.g., [D-10/P-10] for runny nose). It also introduces unsupported 'Knowledge Graph' references. All facts contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: lists 8 specific denied symptoms with citations; explains differentiation for cardiac (chest pain/palpitations), GI (nausea/abdominal pain), common cold (runny nose), neuro (vision/hearing/numbness), supporting respiratory infection/COVID. Generated covers 0% of these, instead focusing on positives and denying negatives exist.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absence of ROS questions (e.g., claims no evidence for chest pain etc., despite [D-16/P-16], [D-17/P-17], etc.); misattributes sore throat/cough confirmations; invents 'Knowledge Graph'; limits to wrong transcript segments ([D-36] to [P-11], ignoring full ROS [D-10 to D-22]). Largely fabricated.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for specific negated symptoms (examples given) and differentiation role. Generated lists positives, denies negatives, vaguely differentiates via positives/COVID knowledge; partially touches differentiation but off-topic by ignoring core request for negatives."
