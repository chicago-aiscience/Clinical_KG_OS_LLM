  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: sputum with red spots [P-4] matches; right-sided chest pain [P-17] matches; fever/feeling off [P-5] and chills [P-9] match; bad cough [P-1] and raw throat after coughing [P-15] match. No errors or contradictions, though some details are omitted.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: cough timeline (missed), full sputum desc (yellow custard + red spots; only red covered partially), full chest pain (location only; misses constant/dull/worsening); fevers details (partial), chills (covered), dyspnea (missed), sore throat (covered), runny nose (missed), no weight loss (missed). Covers ~50% of key points (partial sputum/chest pain/fever, full chills/throat/cough basics).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-4, P-17, P-5, P-9, P-1, P-15); no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing specific symptoms including sputum (partial), chest pain (location), systemic (fever/chills), and related cough/throat; structured and focused with no irrelevant content."
