{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to be ruled out, matches the ordered test as a swab (COVID swab implied by context), states the turnaround time as 48 hours, and correctly reports the isolation instruction (“stay isolated…not see anyone else”). These align with the Gold Answer and the transcript (especially D-39 and P-1). No factual contradictions noted.",
    "completeness": "Covers the main required elements: condition (COVID-19), test (swab), turnaround time (48 hours), and isolation instructions. However, it omits the additional instruction from the Gold Answer/transcript that after results return the patient would receive “further instructions from public health.” Thus, it does not capture 100% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript: patient concern about COVID (P-1), doctor noting overlap with COVID and ordering a swab with 48-hour results and advising isolation (D-39). No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question (condition, test, turnaround, instructions) with no meaningful tangents."
