  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures core facts like productive cough with yellow sputum [P-6] and red spots [P-4], fever [P-5/P-8], chills [P-9], and right-sided chest pain [P-17], aligning with Gold; however, it has factual errors including mis-citing [P-15] (sore throat) for pleuritic chest pain worsening instead of [P-18,P-19], omitting exertional dyspnea [P-10,P-11], not mentioning smoking history [P-37,P-38], and inferring sputum originates from right lung (not in transcript or Gold). Main diagnostic point correct but with discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) productive cough/yellow sputum/red spots (covered), 2) fever/chills timings (partially, misses precise Monday onset), 3) exertional dyspnea/winded on stairs (missed), 4) detailed chest pain (constant dull, worsens deep breath/cough, present at rest - partially covered, lacks detail), 5) pleuritic explanation/localization/parapneumonic (covered well), 6) smoking predisposition (missed). Covers ~60-70% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: cough [P-1], sputum [P-4,P-6], fever/chills [P-5,P-9], chest pain [P-17]; unverifiable/misattributed: [P-15] for chest pain worsening (actually sore throat), sputum 'originating from right lung' (hallucinated), Tylenol specifically for fever/chills (helps symptoms generally [P-14]); pathophysiology plausible but not from transcript. Some hallucinated attributions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by listing specific transcript findings for LRTI/pneumonia and dedicating a section to how pleuritic pain supports diagnosis with citations and explanation; no off-topic content."
