  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer has some factual inaccuracies compared to Gold: it incorrectly implies family history (revealed at D-28/P-28) triggered the doctor's initial plan to examine lungs/heart (stated in D-1, before history is asked), reversing the sequence; attributes evidence to 'the patient' but it's the mother speaking [P-28]; omits doctor's summary [D-30] and full differentiation details like runny nose and prior symptom history. Core facts on asthma history and absence of SOB/wheezing are correct, so some errors but main point intact.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: doctor's specific inquiry [D-28] with mom help; relevance to cough; grandparents asthma [P-28]; doctor summary [D-30]; differentiation via prior workup, no SOB/wheeze/activity [P-28]; current dry cough [cites]; runny nose [cites]; no wheeze/SOB; prior issues different [P-24]; distinct acute. Generated covers: family hx prompting diff dx (partial); prior workup/no SOB/wheeze [P-28]; current cough [P-2]. Misses inquiry details, relevance explanation, runny nose, prior history, doctor's summary. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: exam plan [D-1]; worked up/no SOB/wheeze even activity [P-28]; current cough [P-2]; plausible inference of diff dx from family hx inquiry, no fabrication though 'triggers differential' and 'prioritized' slightly interpretive.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of question: connection of grandparents' asthma to inquiry (via diff dx), and differentiation evidence from symptom profile incl absence SOB/wheezing; no off-topic content."
