  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately recaps only the symptoms (3-4 day dry cough, little bit of fever, headache) from D-58, which are consistent with the Gold Answer's first point, but omits four other key findings (no sputum, no recent sick contacts except brother two weeks ago, no asthma, no medications aside from Claritin), presenting an incomplete list as the full summary; additionally, it incorrectly attributes the 'next steps and where to go from here' phrasing directly as Jessica's primary goal, whereas the Gold Answer cites her explicit words from P-60 ('if I have to like take medicine or something') as the primary goal, with the doctor's framing being a confirmation check—this constitutes significant factual discrepancies and misattribution.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) 3-4 day dry cough + fever + headache (covered); (2) no sputum (missed); (3) no recent sick contacts except brother 2 weeks ago (missed); (4) no asthma (missed); (5) no meds aside Claritin (missed); Jessica's primary goal re: medicine (missed, replaced with doctor's phrasing); secondary desire to go home/lay down (missed)—covers only ~20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about doctor's summary (symptoms) are directly verifiable in D-58; the 'next steps/where to go' phrasing is in D-58 (doctor's words), and Jessica agrees ('Yeah') before specifying medicine in P-60, so mostly grounded with accurate citation, but minor misattribution of phrasing to Jessica introduces a small unverifiable detail.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly structures its response around the two parts of the question (doctor's recapped findings and Jessica's goal), with no off-topic content, perfectly addressing the query."
