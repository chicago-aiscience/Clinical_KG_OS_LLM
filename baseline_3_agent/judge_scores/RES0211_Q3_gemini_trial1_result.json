  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the patient does not explicitly list the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms or joint pain. However, the transcript shows the patient explicitly denies these in P-11, P-12, and P-13. Additionally, it refers to a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided clinical text or the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including the 3-4 day timeline as a typical URI indicator, the patient's fatigue (P-13), and the critical context of household viral exposure (the brother's cold in P-39).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes a hallucination regarding a 'Knowledge Graph.' It also misrepresents the transcript by suggesting the absence of systemic symptoms was inferred by the doctor's summary rather than explicitly stated by the patient during the review of systems.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question of how the symptoms and their absences support the URI assessment."
