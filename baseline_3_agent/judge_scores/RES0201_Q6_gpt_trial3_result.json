{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer’s key facts: symptoms considered consistent with COVID-19, plan for COVID swab and chest X-ray, isolate until results return, and continue isolating if still symptomatic even with a negative test. No contradictory or incorrect statements are introduced.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core required elements asked in the question (assessment, the two diagnostic tests, isolation instruction, and the condition for continued isolation after results). It omits secondary contextual points present in the Gold Answer (e.g., rationale tied to dyspnea/COPD; the plan to confer with the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps; patient acknowledgment). Thus it is slightly less complete than the Gold Answer but includes all major asked-for components.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, especially [D-43]. No additional ungrounded details are added.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested elements: overall assessment, tests, isolation instructions, and the condition for continued isolation after test results. No tangential content."
