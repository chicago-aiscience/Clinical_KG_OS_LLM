  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer and transcript, the Generated Answer correctly states: (1) onset about one week before visit (P-1, P-2) and (2) congestion/stuffiness came first and later shifted to predominantly runny nose (P-3). However, it is incorrect in concluding the course was intermittent rather than constant: while the patient initially said “on and off” (P-1), they later explicitly clarified the symptoms have been “pretty constant for the past week” (P-8). The Generated Answer does not reflect this clarification and therefore mischaracterizes the symptom pattern.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: onset ~1 week; first symptom congestion; predominant symptom shifted to rhinorrhea by visit. Key points missed: the explicit clarification that symptoms were pretty constant over the week (P-8) and the nuance that the patient’s initial “on and off” description was superseded by this later clarification; that symptoms were not improving (P-1); and the possible influence of decongestants on the symptom shift (P-10). Overall, it captures part of the required timeline but omits an essential required element (constant vs intermittent as ultimately reported).",
    "faithfulness": "Statements about onset and symptom sequence are grounded in the transcript (P-1/P-2, P-3). However, the answer’s claim that the symptoms were intermittent “rather than constant” is not faithful to the full transcript because it contradicts the patient’s later direct response that symptoms were “pretty constant for the past week” (P-8). This is a substantive misrepresentation by omission/selective quoting rather than a minor unverifiable detail.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question: onset, which symptom came first, how the predominant symptom changed, and (attempted) description of constancy/intermittence. No major tangents."

  "summary": "The answer correctly identifies onset timing and the shift from initial congestion to predominant rhinorrhea, but it incorrectly characterizes the symptoms as intermittent despite the patient’s later clarification that they were pretty constant, making it incomplete and not fully faithful to the transcript."
