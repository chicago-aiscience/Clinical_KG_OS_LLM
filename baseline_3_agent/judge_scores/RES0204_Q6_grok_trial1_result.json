  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main elements of the plan including the two diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab) with correct citations, the consultation with the supervising physician, and follow-up discussion, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancies include not mentioning the physical exam of lungs and heart from [D-1], phrasing 'perform' instead of 'arrange/might want,' and slight rephrasing of explanations, but no major errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnostic tests (chest X-ray [D-37,39], COVID swab [D-39]), consultation ([D-1,37,40]), follow-up steps ([D-1,40]). Missed: explicit mention of initial physical exam (lungs/heart [D-1]), age-appropriate explanations and reassurance details [D-39], 'might want' qualifier for X-ray, standard protocol phrasing, patient acknowledgment [P-40], and closing thanks [D-41,42]. Covers approximately 80-90% of Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations ([D-37,39,40,1]). Minor issues: 'perform/administer' vs. 'arrange/do/might want'; 'present the findings from the tests' implies tests are done, but they are planned post-consult; 'return to health' paraphrases [D-37]. No multiple hallucinations, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured directly around the question's requirements (diagnostic tests, consultation, follow-up steps), with no off-topic content, perfectly focused on describing the communicated plan."
