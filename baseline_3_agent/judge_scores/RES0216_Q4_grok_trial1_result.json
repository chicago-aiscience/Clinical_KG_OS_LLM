  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as 'cardiac ischemic' matching the Gold's 'cardiac ischemic picture' [D-36]. It accurately notes the doctor's citation of no 'getting out of breath with exercise' and chest tightness [D-36], supported by patient description [P-1], and absence of pain [D-36], which aligns with Gold's emphasis on tightness over pain [P-5]. However, it omits the Gold's details on absent anxiety, sweating, impending doom [P-6, D-6], and clinician screening [D-5, D-6], representing minor discrepancies but core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: condition ('cardiac ischemic picture'), nature of complaints (tightness not exertional dyspnea [D-36], patient tightness on breathing/walking [P-1]); absence of pain [D-36]. Missed: explicit tightness vs pain distinction [P-5], patient-reported difficulty with full breath [P-7], absent anxiety/sweating/impending doom [P-6, D-6], clinician screening [D-5, D-6], combination rationale, patient relief [P-35]. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable in transcript: condition [D-36], no out-of-breath with exercise and tightness [D-36], patient quotes exact [P-1], no pain [D-36]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly identifies the condition and structures evidence into 'nature of chest complaints' (tightness, no exertional SOB) and 'absence of specific symptoms' (no pain), precisely matching the question's request for both categories without off-topic content."
