{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the reported symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, malaise, headache, feeling hot). However, it mischaracterizes the denial of sputum as 'implicit' when she explicitly said 'No' and 'no nothing' in the transcript (P-5, P-6). It also includes denials of asthma and sick contacts which are medical history/exposure facts rather than symptom denials requested by the prompt context.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is significantly incomplete regarding the 'Explicit Denials' section. The prompt specifically asked for denials like nausea, joint pain, and rashes (using 'e.g.'). The Generated Answer only mentions sputum and ignores nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and joint pain, all of which were explicitly denied in the transcript (P-10 to P-13) and included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the transcript. The use of 'implicitly' for the sputum denial is a minor interpretive error as the patient gave a direct negative response, but the factual takeaway (that she denied it) remains grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question but fails to address the specific examples provided in the prompt (nausea, joint pain, rashes) in its response, making it less helpful than the Gold Answer."
