  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The diagnosis of 'Functional Chest Pain (or Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain) related to Academic Stress' is fully consistent with the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' All specific observations cited (stressors [P-15, P-13], history [P-21], somatic symptoms [P-3, P-6, P-19], patient attribution [P-8]) are factually accurate and match the transcript and Gold Answer without errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: history of anxiety [P-21, P-22], significant stress/thesis [P-13, P-15, P-16], nervous breathing/SOB [P-19], patient considers stress [P-8]. Missed: situational pattern (pain when alone walking/studying, resolves with distraction/social [P-4, P-9, P-29]), pertinent negatives (no fevers [P-12], no exertional [P-10], rest pain [P-11], no palpitations outside anxiety [P-20], no asthma [P-23/24]). Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., P-15 for thesis stress, P-21 for anxiety history, P-19 for nervous breathing). No hallucinations; 'Functional Chest Pain' is a plausible clinical term grounded in the anxiety/stress pattern described.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by stating the diagnosis and providing specific clinical observations with citations from the consultation; no off-topic content."
