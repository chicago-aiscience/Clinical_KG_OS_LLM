  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes the temporal connection (seizure same night as missed dose due to disrupted routine [P-8, P-24]) and patient's attribution without invoking general medical knowledge. Generated Answer correctly identifies the missed Keppra dose and patient's recognition via accurate P-9 quote, but introduces 'non-adherence is a known precipitant' as the causal mechanism, which is a minor discrepancy as it relies on external knowledge rather than transcript-specific timing and patient report alone. Core facts (missed dose, patient link in P-9) are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: temporal coincidence same night [P-8, P-24], disrupted routine details (daughter's birthday, no dinner), voluntary/spontaneous recognition in response to D-9, 'usually don't get seizures often' implying unusual trigger, no clinician confirmation. Generated covers: causal link via missed Keppra, P-9 quote attribution, Keppra named [P-23]. Misses: timing details, P-24 explanation, spontaneous context, frequency note, clinician absence. Covers ~50-60% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "P-9 quote verifiable and accurate. Keppra from P-23 verifiable. Causal claim grounded in patient's words but 'known precipitant for seizures' not explicitly in transcript (plausible medically, based on patient implication). No major hallucinations; citations correct. Minor external detail.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both question parts: connection of missed dose to seizure, evidence of patient's recognition with transcript quote. No irrelevant content or tangents."
