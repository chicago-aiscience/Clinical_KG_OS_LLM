  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies no current medications for anxiety (stopped 2-3 years ago, P-24), no prescribed meds for acid reflux with dietary management only (P-25), and notes the patient's request for cough medication (P-35) without confirming any prescribed. However, it hallucinates non-pharmacological management for anxiety by incorrectly inferring dietary avoidance (P-25, which is reflux-specific) applies to anxiety; introduces COVID-19 as a 'condition' with PPE 'treatment' despite negative test and it not being a diagnosed condition (P-17, P-35); omits hay fever entirely and the explicit overall statement of no current meds (P-23). These are significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold Answer's precise summary of zero meds across conditions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: no prescribed meds overall (implied), anxiety stopped years ago (100%), reflux diet only no meds (100%), cough request but none prescribed (partial). Missed: hay fever no treatment described (P-27), explicit no cough meds yet and doctor's plan (D-37), direct quote/emphasis on P-23 'used to, not anymore,' full summary of zero meds across all conditions (anxiety, reflux, hay fever, cough). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: anxiety (P-24), reflux diet (P-25), cough request (P-35), negative COVID test (P-35). Unverifiable/hallucinated: anxiety managed via diet/triggers inferred from P-25 (reflux only); COVID-19 as condition with PPE treatment (preventive at work P-17, not treatment); extra cough symptom details verifiable but not central. Multiple hallucinated inferences.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses current meds/treatment by condition, specifies reflux diet and no prescribed meds; structured response focused on question. Minor tangents: excessive cough symptom details, irrelevant COVID-19 section."
