  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately captures the patient's initial reports from P-1 and P-8. However, it fails to incorporate the clarification in P-4 regarding the 'loss of taste', which the patient later explains is only partial (can still taste salty food). By only quoting P-1, it implies a total loss of taste which contradicts the later clarification in the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses significant details requested by the prompt and present in the Gold Answer. It omits the specific sensory details from P-4 (perceiving 'really bad' smells, 'really salty' foods, and the inability to taste 'normal things' like a banana). It also misses the duration (two days), the non-productive nature of the cough (no sputum/blood), and the concurrent onset of symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript, using specific quotes from P-1 and P-8.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but fails to follow the specific instruction to 'Include any details the patient provided about what they could and could not still perceive,' particularly regarding the sense of taste."
