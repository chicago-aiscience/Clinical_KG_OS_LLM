  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant temporal error: it claims the doctor prioritized the lung/heart exam [D-1] because of the family history, but that history is not revealed until [P-28]. Additionally, it attributes the mother's statements in [P-28] ('he's been worked up') to the patient. However, the core identification of the absence of wheezing and shortness of breath is correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including: the specific mention of the runny nose symptoms [D-11, D-12], the doctor's summary of 'some asthma' [D-30], and the patient's own observation that previous illnesses were shorter and didn't involve this specific dry cough [P-24].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates a causal link between the asthma history and the initial exam plan in [D-1], which happened before the history was taken. It also misattributes the speaker of [P-28] (the mother) to the patient.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the two parts of the question, focusing on the connection of asthma history and the differentiating symptoms."
