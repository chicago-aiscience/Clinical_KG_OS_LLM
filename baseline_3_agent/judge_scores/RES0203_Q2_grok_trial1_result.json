  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient tried no prior treatments, matching the Gold Answer's reference to P-9 and implicitly P-24. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test as the recommended intervention with matching instructions on timeline and isolation from D-39. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points: no prior treatments (100%), doctor's recommendation of swab test (100%), instructions on results timeline and isolation protocol (100%). Misses minor details like explicit no regular medications (P-24), potential other tests, and consultation with supervising doctor (D-40), covering ~90% of Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: no prior treatments from P-9, symptoms from P-1/P-8, test/swab/reasons/timeline/isolation from D-39; citations accurate. Minor issue: mentions non-existent 'knowledge graph', but no impact on factual content from transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question with sections on prior treatments, recommended treatment, and instructions; no off-topic content."
