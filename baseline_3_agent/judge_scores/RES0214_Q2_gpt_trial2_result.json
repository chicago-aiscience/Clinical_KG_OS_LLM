  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient only takes multivitamins and that her reported drug allergy is penicillin. However, it is factually incorrect in stating that the transcript does not specify the adverse reaction to penicillin—she explicitly says she gets a rash [P-38] and denies trouble breathing [P-39]. Because the question specifically asks for the adverse reaction, this is a significant error.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points: (1) regimen limited to multivitamins only; (2) no prescription meds for pre-diabetes/other conditions; (3) penicillin allergy; (4) reaction is rash; (5) no trouble breathing. The Generated Answer includes (1) and (3), partially addresses pre-diabetes but adds an unsupported claim about management, and omits/gets wrong (4) and omits (5) and (2). Overall, it covers about half of the required key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The statement that the reaction is \"not specified\" is contradicted by the transcript [P-38]. It also introduces content not present in the provided transcript (e.g., references to a \"Knowledge Graph\" and that pre-diabetes is managed with multivitamins), which is not verifiable from the source. These issues reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to answer exactly what was asked (medication regimen, allergy, reaction) and does not contain major tangential content, but the adverse reaction section is incorrect."
