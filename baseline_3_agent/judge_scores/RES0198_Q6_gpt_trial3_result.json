  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on the working diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), supportive care (hydration, OTC meds like Tylenol Cold), COVID swab testing, and isolation while awaiting results with a 48-hour timeframe. No contradictory or incorrect statements were added. Minor omission of some plan elements does not create factual inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) diagnosis: viral infection/common cold; (2) supportive care: hydrate, OTC meds like Tylenol Cold; (3) diagnostic test: COVID swab; (4) result timeline: ~48 hours; (5) public health guidance: isolate at home/avoid others while awaiting results. Missing elements from Gold Answer: (a) expectation-setting that symptoms may take a few weeks to resolve and that there is little beyond supportive care; (b) statement that after results return the patient will receive further instructions from public health. Overall this is substantial but not fully complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by [D-39] (viral/common cold, hydration, Tylenol Cold, swab today with results in 48 hours, isolate at home/avoid others). No notable hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested end-of-visit management plan components (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic testing, and public health guidance)."
