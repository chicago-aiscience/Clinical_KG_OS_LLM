  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer precisely matches the Gold Answer's identification of symptoms for the general infectious process ('fevers and fatigue and muscle aches' from D-36) and the additional symptoms leading to COVID-19 not being ruled out ('difficulty breathing, sore throat, and cough' from D-36). It accurately quotes the transcript and aligns with the Gold's interpretation without any factual errors or contradictions, including the two-layer synthesis in D-36.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: symptoms for general infection (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches), additional COVID-concerning symptoms (difficulty breathing + sore throat/cough), direct citations to D-36, and the doctor's assessment structure. Missed: explicit note that loss of taste/smell were not cited in D-36, reference to doctor's orders (swab, isolation), and patient's worry – these are supplementary context, not core symptom lists required by the question. Covers 100% of primary key symptom points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript: quotes from D-36 exactly match ('fevers and fatigue and muscle aches', 'difficulty breathing', 'sore throat and cough'); patient correlations (e.g., shortness of breath in P-1) are accurate and cited. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by clearly delineating and citing the exact symptoms from the doctor's D-36 assessment for each category (general infectious process vs. COVID-specific concern), with a focused breakdown and no extraneous content."
