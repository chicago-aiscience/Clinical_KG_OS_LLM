  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states assessment includes symptoms consistent with COVID and patient otherwise generally well [D-16]; Generated partially covers consistency [D-39] but omits 'otherwise well'. Correctly covers test (swab [D-39]), timeline (day or two [D-39]), self-care (self-isolate until results, potentially longer [D-39]). However, Generated incorrectly states no mention of additional tests or supervising physician consult, contradicting Gold and transcript [D-40] ('might be a couple other tests', 'go over this with the doctor that I'm working with'). Significant contradictions on key management elements.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: assessment (COVID consistent + otherwise well) - partial; COVID test/swab - yes; self-isolate details - yes; timeline - yes; possible additional tests - no (denied); consult supervising physician - no (denied); possible more questions/follow-up - no; reassurance - no. Covers core assessment/test/timeline/self-care (~60-70%), misses/contradicts additional tests, consult, follow-up.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: assessment [D-39], test/swab [D-39], timeline [D-39], self-isolate [D-39]. However, falsely claims 'prompt and transcript segments do not mention' supervising consult or additional tests, despite clear evidence in [D-40] ('couple other tests', 'go over with doctor I'm working with'). This introduces hallucinated absence, a significant fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address question elements (assessment, tests/method, timeline, self-care, additional/follow-up); directly responds without irrelevant content or tangents."
