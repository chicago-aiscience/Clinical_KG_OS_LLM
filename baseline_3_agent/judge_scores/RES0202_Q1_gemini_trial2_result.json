  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error: it states the boy had a 'big appetite,' whereas the transcript (P-15) and Gold Answer explicitly state he did not. Additionally, it fails to include the runny nose reported by the mother. It also fails to identify wheezing, sore throat, and chills as denied symptoms, despite these being specifically requested as examples in the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The answer is missing several key reported symptoms (runny nose) and the vast majority of the pertinent negatives (denied symptoms) found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it ignores 3 out of the 5 symptoms explicitly mentioned in the prompt's parenthetical examples (wheezing, sore throat, and chills).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the transcript in its description of appetite, claiming a 'big appetite' when the source says 'doesn't seem to have a big appetite.' It also references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source materials, indicating a degree of hallucinated context.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address the question, but it falls short by failing to provide the specific symptoms listed as examples in the question (wheezing, sore throat, and chills)."
