  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the productive cough resolving after 4-5 days, persistent cough for 2 weeks, transition to dry cough, and chest soreness/pain when coughing excessively, all matching the Gold Answer and transcript. Minor discrepancy in labeling 'chest hurts a little bit' and 'sore' as 'Chest Pain' without noting it is not independent chest pain, but core facts are consistent without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: resolved productive cough with whitish clear mucus for first 4-5 days [P-6]; persistent cough for 2 weeks [P-2]; dry cough since day 4-5 [P-6]; chest soreness with excessive coughing [P-15]. Key points missed: resolved sore throat for first 2-3 days [P-13]; resolved runny nose in first couple days [P-14]; early 'flu symptoms' resolved in 3-4 days except cough [P-14]; cough details like 3-4 times/hour [P-9], spontaneous/no triggers [P-10], stable intensity [P-7] and frequency [P-8]; pertinent negatives (no difficulty breathing [P-11], no fevers [P-12], no nausea/vomiting [P-19], no abdominal pain [P-20]). Covers ~30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: productive cough/mucus [P-6], persistent cough [P-2], dry cough transition [P-6], chest pain/soreness when coughing [P-15]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by categorizing symptoms into 'Resolved Symptoms' and 'Symptoms Still Present' with specific details from the transcript, containing no off-topic content."
