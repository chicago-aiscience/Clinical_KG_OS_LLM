  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is entirely consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It accurately lists the respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea) and systemic symptoms (fever, sinus pressure) and correctly identifies the cough as the most bothersome symptom.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures about 80% of the symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer. It includes the primary respiratory and systemic complaints but omits the patient's reduced exercise tolerance (walking the dog/block) and the mild headache. It also excludes the pertinent negatives provided in the Gold Answer, which, while not specifically requested, added to the Gold's completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is highly faithful to the transcript, with all claims directly supported by the text and accompanied by accurate speaker turn citations. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The response is perfectly relevant, focusing specifically on the respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, and the most bothersome symptom as requested by the prompt."
