  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer lists specific constitutional symptoms denied (night sweats [D5/P5], weight loss [D6-8/P6-8], hemoptysis [D10/P10]) and exposure risks (sick contacts [D14/P14, D15/P15, D32/P32], travel [D33-34/P33-34], IV drug use [D40/P40], cocaine/heroin [D39/P39]), plus others like stiff neck. Generated vaguely references constitutional symptoms and hemoptysis via D47 summary only, misses naming/listing specifics with citations; incorrectly includes irrelevant cat exposure and focuses on smoking/marijuana (partial overlap with substance use but wrong emphasis, misses IVDU/cocaine); TB exclusion mentioned but not tied accurately to denied specifics. Significant discrepancies and omissions contradict Gold's detailed facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3 specific constitutional symptoms with citations, 5 exposure risks with citations, explanations for TB/malignancy/chronic infections, additional screens (stiff neck, N/V, pain), D47 summary. Generated covers: vague constitutional symptoms/hemoptysis (via D47), TB/chronic infections generally; adds irrelevant cat/smoking. Misses night sweats, weight loss details/citations, all sick contacts, travel, IVDU/cocaine/heroin, other screens. Covers ~20-30% (general constitutional denial, hemoptysis, TB).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims verifiable in transcript: constitutional summary [D47], hemoptysis [D47/D10], cat allergy [P27], smoking/marijuana [P36]; TB screening symptoms (night sweats etc.) are in transcript (D4-8) though not cited specifically; patient denials partially accurate but sleep disturbance was affirmed [P20-21], not fully denied; no major fabrications, minor selective/misgrounded emphasis on D47 over earlier details, irrelevant but grounded inclusions like cat.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer around screened symptoms/exposures denied and conditions excluded (TB/chronic infections), addressing question core; minor tangents/irrelevancies (cat allergy, detailed smoking/vaping not key for TB exposures); mostly focused despite misses."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question with vague coverage of constitutional symptoms and TB exclusion but misses most specific denied symptoms/exposures from the Gold Answer, includes irrelevant details, and relies heavily on the closing summary rather than primary screening exchanges."
