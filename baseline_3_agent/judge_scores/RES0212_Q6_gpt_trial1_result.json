  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s end-of-visit statements in [D-47]: (1) the plan to “go review your story with the doctors,” (2) the summary that the cough has been present for a while but worsened over the last three days, with nighttime awakening and greenish sputum and no blood, and (3) the doctor’s statement that there are no constitutional symptoms. Its description of what would guide next steps (reviewing the history/story with the doctors) is consistent with the Gold Answer’s framing that next steps would depend on the supervising physician’s assessment after hearing the case. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: plan to review story with other doctors; summary of chronic cough with acute worsening, nighttime waking, green sputum, no blood; explicit absence of constitutional symptoms; and that next steps depend on that review. Key elements missing or less explicit: that this implies a trainee presenting to a supervising physician; that no tests/imaging/treatments were ordered in the transcript; and the patient’s closing concern about exercise interference / the doctor’s “We’ll see what we can do.” Overall, it captures most of what the question asks but not all contextual details included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in [D-47] (and the immediately surrounding content). It does not introduce specific tests, diagnoses, or treatments not present. Minor interpretive language (“history and current presentation”) is a reasonable paraphrase of “your story” and does not add unsupported specifics.",
    "relevance": "The answer is directly organized around the three items asked (plan, assessment, and what would guide next steps) and stays on-topic without tangents."
