  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer matches the Gold Answer on all elements asked in the question: the condition to rule out (COVID-19), the diagnostic test (a swab), the expected turnaround time (24–48 hours), and the alternative diagnosis if negative (another viral illness). No incorrect or contradictory statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "For the specific question, the generated answer includes all required components: (1) COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, (2) swab testing, (3) 24–48 hour turnaround time, and (4) alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative. It does not include additional counseling points present in the Gold Answer (isolation, contact tracing, supportive care), but those were not asked by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript at [D-52]. No details beyond the transcript are added.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what was asked (rule-out condition, test + turnaround, alternative diagnosis) with no tangential content."
