  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states that 'The provided transcript does not contain evidence that the doctor used an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map,' but the transcript clearly shows at [D-13] the doctor says 'I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up' and then states 'Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.' This directly contradicts the Generated Answer's claim. The attachment duration reasoning is correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the attachment duration aspect well (approximately 50% of key points), but completely misses or denies the geographic map justification that is explicitly present in the transcript. It fails to include the doctor's actual statements about checking the distribution map and finding Strathroy to be a concerning location. The conclusion about moving forward with antibiotics based on geography is omitted.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination by denying information that is clearly present in the transcript. At [D-13], the doctor explicitly discusses the Lyme disease distribution map and Strathroy's position on it. The statement 'does not contain evidence' is a fabrication that contradicts verifiable transcript content. The rest of the answer is grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses both parts of the question - attachment duration and geographic justification. However, by incorrectly denying the geographic map evidence, it fails to properly answer the second part of the question. The attachment duration portion is relevant and focused."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly explains the 72-hour attachment duration calculation based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening activities. However, it contains a critical factual error by denying that the doctor used the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, when the transcript at [D-13] explicitly shows the doctor referencing this map and concluding that Strathroy's position justifies concern. This significant omission results in an incomplete and partially incorrect response that misses approximately half of the required information."
