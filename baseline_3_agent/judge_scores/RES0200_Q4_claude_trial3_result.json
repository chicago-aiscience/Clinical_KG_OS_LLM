  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 (referred to as 'Covid') as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the specific test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All core facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and are accurately extracted from [D-52]. The answer is factually correct in all respects.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key components of the question: the alternative diagnosis (COVID), the specific test (COVID swab), and the turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, the Gold Answer provides additional context about symptom overlap (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) and includes more detailed explanation from the transcript. The Generated Answer is more concise but still addresses all required elements of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The answer uses bullet points for clarity and correctly cites the source. There is no hallucination or fabrication - everything stated can be traced back to the doctor's statement in [D-52]. The answer is completely grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question in a clear, organized manner. The bullet-point format enhances readability and ensures each component is explicitly addressed. There is no irrelevant content - the answer is perfectly focused on what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly accurate and well-structured, correctly identifying COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All information is properly cited and grounded in the transcript. While slightly less detailed than the Gold Answer (missing contextual information about specific overlapping symptoms), it fully addresses all required elements of the question with perfect factual accuracy and relevance."
