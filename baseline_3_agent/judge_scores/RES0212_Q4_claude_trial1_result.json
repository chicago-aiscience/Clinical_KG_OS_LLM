    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It completely misses the most critical constitutional symptoms that were screened: night sweats [D-5, P-5], unexplained weight loss [D-6 to D-8, P-6 to P-8], and hemoptysis [D-10, P-10]. It incorrectly states hemoptysis screening was at [D-47] when it actually occurred at [D-10]. The Generated Answer also fails to mention key exposure screenings: sick contacts at pole dancing class [D-14], recent sick contacts [D-15], roommate illness [D-32], recent travel [D-33-34], and IV drug use [D-40]. While it mentions substance use screening, it focuses on marijuana/vaping rather than the more critical IV drug use and cocaine/heroin screening [D-39, D-40]. The answer also incorrectly lists 'cat exposure' as a relevant screening item for TB or chronic infections, when this was an allergy question unrelated to infection risk.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 30% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: 1) Night sweats screening [D-5], 2) Weight loss and loose-fitting clothes screening [D-6-8], 3) Hemoptysis at the correct location [D-10], 4) Sick contacts at pole dancing class [D-14], 5) Recent sick contacts [D-15], 6) Roommate illness screening [D-32], 7) Travel history [D-33-34], 8) IV drug use [D-40], 9) Cocaine/heroin use [D-39], 10) Stiff neck [D-18], 11) Nausea/vomiting [D-17], and 12) Body pain [D-19]. The answer only partially addresses constitutional symptoms and substance use, and incorrectly emphasizes cat exposure which is not relevant to TB/chronic infection screening.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer shows moderate hallucination. It incorrectly cites [D-47] as the location where hemoptysis was screened, when this actually occurred at [D-10]. It mischaracterizes [D-47] as screening for 'constitutional symptoms' generally, when this was actually the doctor's summary statement. The claim about 'sleep disturbance and general illness' assessment at [D-47] is a misinterpretation - this was a summary, not a screening question. The inclusion of cat exposure as a relevant screening item for TB/chronic infections is misleading, as this was purely an allergy question [D-27-28]. However, the substance use screening is accurately represented, and the patient's denials cited are verifiable in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is partially relevant but significantly off-target. It attempts to address what was screened and denied, and mentions TB and chronic infections as conditions to exclude. However, it focuses heavily on less relevant items (cat exposure, marijuana/vaping) while omitting the most critical screening elements for TB (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis). The answer does address the question's core components but with incorrect emphasis and major omissions of the most clinically significant screening questions that are specifically designed to exclude TB and other serious chronic infections."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It contains major factual errors, particularly in misidentifying where hemoptysis screening occurred and completely omitting critical constitutional symptoms like night sweats and weight loss. The answer covers less than 30% of key screening points from the Gold Answer, missing essential TB screening questions and exposure risk assessments. While some citations are accurate (substance use screening), there are notable hallucinations and misinterpretations of the transcript. The answer is partially relevant in addressing TB and chronic infections but emphasizes less critical items (cat exposure) while omitting the most important screening elements. The average score of 2.5 reflects these substantial gaps in correctness, completeness, and appropriate clinical focus."
