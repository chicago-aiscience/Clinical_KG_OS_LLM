  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the husband's illness as a reason to prioritize COVID-19 and the lack of a flu shot as a reason to maintain influenza on the differential diagnosis. The medical logic aligns perfectly with the doctor's statements in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the three main risk factors mentioned in the question: the husband's illness, the shared household, and the lack of a flu shot. However, it lacks the specific details regarding 'limited outside contact' that are present in the Gold Answer (specifically the patient working from home and the hiking trip being the only notable exposure). These details provide context for why household transmission is the most likely route.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes significant references to a 'knowledge graph' (e.g., [KG: fever/sore throat --RELATED_TO--> husband_current_illness]), which was not part of the provided source material. While the clinical facts themselves are supported by the transcript, the attribution to an external knowledge graph constitutes a hallucination of source material. The transcript citations for turns (e.g., [P-19], [D-53]) are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question, structuring the response around the three specific epidemiological factors requested and explaining how they shape the doctor's differential diagnosis."
