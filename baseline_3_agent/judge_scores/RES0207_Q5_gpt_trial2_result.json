  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main contributors described in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose) and (2) hereditary predisposition (maternal history of epilepsy). However, it adds a potentially misleading clinical claim that the recent seizure “definitively establishes”/“confirms” the epilepsy diagnosis. In the transcript, the patient already has a known epilepsy diagnosis (“I do have a seizure disorder I have epilepsy” [P-8]); the seizure episode does not newly establish that diagnosis. This is a minor but real overstatement relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core required points: missed Keppra dose as precipitant and maternal epilepsy as hereditary risk, and it links family history to underlying epilepsy susceptibility. It omits two supporting details emphasized in the Gold Answer: (1) the reason for missing the dose (daughter’s birthday/routine disruption [P-24]) and (2) that seizures are usually infrequent (suggesting baseline control when adherent [P-9]). Overall, most key content is present but not all.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by transcript citations (Keppra use [P-23], missed dose likely trigger [P-9], family history/mother [P-26], epilepsy diagnosis [P-8]). The statement that the seizure episode “definitively establishes/serves as clinical evidence confirming” the diagnosis is not explicitly supported and is an interpretive leap; the transcript supports pre-existing epilepsy rather than diagnostic confirmation. Thus, minor ungrounded inference but largely faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on hereditary and medication-related risk factors and explicitly addresses how family history relates to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis. No meaningful tangents."
