  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the clinician’s conclusion of a viral URI/common cold [D-39], the main symptoms (stuffy/runny nose) [P-1], and symptom progression from congestion to mostly runny nose [P-3]. It is mostly accurate on duration (~1 week) [P-1, P-2] and references the clinician’s comment that colds may take a few weeks to resolve [D-39]. Minor issues: it states symptoms were “on and off for the past week,” whereas the patient later described symptoms as “pretty constant for the past week” [P-8]; it also introduces interpretive comparisons (e.g., “rapid-resolution allergic reaction,” “sudden onset of bacterial infection”) that are not supported by the transcript or Gold Answer framing.",
    "completeness": "It captures only a subset of Gold Answer evidence: symptom type (congestion/rhinorrhea), progression, duration/timeline, and the explicit clinician assessment. It omits several key Gold Answer supports that specifically differentiate viral from allergic/bacterial causes: clear discharge/no colored mucus [P-5]; absence of cough, sore throat, SOB, fever/chills, post-nasal drip [P-4, P-6, P-7]; lack of allergen exposures (fumes/dust/animals) and no allergy history [P-22, P-28]; lack of headache [P-14]; and the daycare exposure context [P-11, P-12]. Overall, it covers well under half of the Gold Answer’s key discriminating points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the provided transcript, notably references to a “Knowledge Graph” and claims like “According to the Knowledge Graph… indicate viral illness,” which are not present in the source. Other claims are generally consistent with transcript content (symptoms, course, clinician conclusion). Because it introduces an external source and some unsupported comparative reasoning, faithfulness is moderate rather than high.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on explaining why the clinician thought the illness was viral, but it only weakly addresses the ‘rather than allergic or bacterial’ part of the question and does not use the key differentiators (clear discharge, absent systemic/lower respiratory symptoms, lack of allergen exposure). It is partially relevant but does not directly answer the full comparative reasoning requested."
