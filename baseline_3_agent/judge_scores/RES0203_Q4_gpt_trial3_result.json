  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer lists multiple specific review-of-systems (ROS) negatives explicitly denied in the transcript (no fever, no dyspnea, no headache, no sore throat, no chills/night sweats, no myalgias/weakness, no chest pain, no sputum/blood, no triggers). The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript does not explicitly contain denials of symptoms like fever/dyspnea/sore throat, which directly contradicts P-10 through P-15 and P-22. It also incorrectly states negative confirmations for immunizations and family history are not visible, though P-20 (“Yes” immunizations up to date) and P-27 (“No, nothing like that”) are present. Therefore, it is largely inconsistent with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points include: no fever; no difficulty breathing; no headaches; no sore throat; no chills/night sweats; no muscle aches/general weakness; no chest pain; no sputum or blood; no cough triggers; plus denials of chronic conditions, meds, surgery/hospitalization, allergies, and relevant family history. The Generated Answer only mentions immunizations and family history screening (and even mishandles the responses), and does not list the ROS negatives requested. It omits the vast majority of required negative findings and the intended clinical interpretation tied to those negatives. Coverage is far below 20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Some elements are grounded (patient has smell/taste loss and dry cough; doctor asked about immunizations and family history). However, the answer introduces an unprovided “knowledge graph” and makes multiple claims that denials are not in the transcript when they are. This represents several unfaithful/unsupported statements and misreadings of the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for all negative ROS findings and how their absence informed the clinical picture. The Generated Answer mostly discusses positive symptoms and testing rationale, fails to list the negative ROS items, and focuses on unrelated meta-claims about missing data. Thus it only minimally addresses the question’s intent."
