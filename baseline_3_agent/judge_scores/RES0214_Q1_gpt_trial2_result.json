  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle aches) match the Gold Answer and are supported by the transcript ([P-1], [P-13]). The denied clinically significant symptoms list (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing) also matches the Gold Answer and transcript content ([P-10], [P-8], [P-7], [P-5], [P-24]-[P-26]). However, the supporting-evidence narrative contains a factual error: it claims the patient did not answer the neck stiffness question and only implied absence, but in the transcript she explicitly answers \"No\" to neck stiffness [P-7]. This is a minor but clear inaccuracy in justification, even though the final denial list is correct.",
    "completeness": "For the question asked, the Generated Answer includes all required elements: (1) the four symptoms reported at the visit and (2) explicit denials for cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing. It does not add optional additional negatives (vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, bowel changes), but those were not required by the prompt. Overall coverage of the asked-for key points is complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly grounded in the transcript (reported symptoms and the five denials). The answer includes one ungrounded/incorrect statement: it asserts the patient did not answer the neck stiffness question and merely implied its absence, which contradicts the transcript where she explicitly denies neck stiffness [P-7]. Aside from that, the content is consistent with the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses exactly what was asked: four reported symptoms and explicit denials of the specified clinically significant symptoms. No meaningful irrelevant content."
