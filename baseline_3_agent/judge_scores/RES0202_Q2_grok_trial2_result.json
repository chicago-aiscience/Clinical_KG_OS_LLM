  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core recommendations from the Gold Answer: COVID swab test with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation specifically from the younger sister, and ER precautions for worsening symptoms. Minor discrepancy in presenting asthma consideration from [D-45] as tied to a negative swab and persistent symptoms, whereas the Gold Answer emphasizes false negatives or other viral illnesses from [D-44], and [D-45] contexts asthma hypothetically without fever. Household parents are not mentioned in Generated but not central to isolation instruction. No major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: COVID swab and timeline (100%), isolation for 14 days from younger sister (100%), ER precautions (nearly verbatim). Partially covers household (sister yes, parents missed), false-negative/other viral illness (missed, asthma partially substitutes), no medications/supportive care (missed), school requirement/mother's acknowledgment (missed). Covers ~70-80% of Gold's points, prioritizing question-specific elements (test, isolation, specific person).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: test/isolation/sister/ER symptoms from [D-44]; asthma reference from [D-45] accurate citation though interpretive linkage to negative swab. No fabrications; minor stretch on asthma context but grounded. Citations precise.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question's core: diagnostic test (COVID swab), isolation instructions/duration (14 days), specific household member (younger sister). Additional safety netting is directly relevant management advice; structured bullets enhance focus."
