  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the husband's illness, the patient's lack of a flu shot, and the resulting prioritization of COVID-19 with influenza as a differential. The clinical reasoning attributed to the doctor (ruling out COVID-19 first) matches the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all three epidemiological factors mentioned in the question. However, it is slightly less complete than the Gold Answer regarding the 'limited outside contact' factor; while the Gold Answer explains that limited contact supports the theory of household transmission over independent exposures, the Generated Answer focuses more on the clinical action (isolation) resulting from the shared environment.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer includes multiple references to a 'knowledge graph' (e.g., [KG: ...]) which is not present in the provided source transcript. While the factual information contained in these references is generally supported by the dialogue, the attribution to a non-existent knowledge graph constitutes a minor structural hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's specific request to explain how these three factors collectively shape the differential diagnosis."
