  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness) and increased bronchodilator use as pointing to asthma exacerbation, aligning with the Gold Answer's core facts. However, it has minor discrepancies like inaccurate citations (e.g., chest tightness cited as P-4/P-9 instead of P-20; increased use as P-9 instead of P-8), refers to a non-existent 'knowledge graph,' and calls it a 'triad' while listing four symptoms. Core message is consistent, no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: symptoms with examples (dry cough P-1/P-14, SOB P-1/P-19, wheezing P-15, chest tightness), bronchodilator relief (P-1), escalation in use (P-8 details), triggers (exercise/cold P-9/P-11). Missed or undetailed: explicit asthma history since age 8 (P-2/D-3), wheezing more frequent than use (P-17), extensive no-infection screening (P-21-P-28, dry cough no gunk), need for med adjustment. Covers ~70% of keys.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: symptoms verifiable (P-1, P-15, P-20 etc.), increase in use (P-8), triggers (P-9/P-11), bronchodilator helps (P-1), family history (P-32). Hallucinations: 'knowledge graph' not in transcript; inaccurate citations (chest tightness P-4/P-9 wrong; use P-9 wrong); implies question states frequency but cites poorly. Multiple citation errors and fabricated element reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by explaining how the specified symptoms and bronchodilator increase indicate worsening asthma vs. new condition, with structured evidence breakdown focused on the query. No off-topic content."
