  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s prescribed medication for epilepsy (matches Gold: Keppra for chronic epilepsy). It also correctly states the patient missed a dose because they forgot (true per transcript), but it does not provide the *specific* situational trigger described in the Gold Answer (daughter’s birthday/changed dinner routine). No directly false statements are made.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: (1) Keppra for chronic epilepsy, (2) missed dose acknowledged, (3) specific circumstance: daughter’s birthday celebration earlier + altered routine/no usual dinner leading to forgetting, (4) situational/isolated lapse rather than ongoing adherence issue, and (5) patient links missed dose to seizure. Generated answer includes (1) and a generic version of (2) only; it misses (3)-(5).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are supported by the transcript: Keppra (P-23) and forgetting the medication (P-9). No hallucinated details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic and addresses both parts of the question, but the second part is answered only generally (“forgot”) rather than giving the specific circumstance requested (birthday/changed routine)."
