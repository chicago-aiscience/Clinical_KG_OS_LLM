    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple significant factual errors. Most critically, it incorrectly states that smoking history was not elicited, when in fact the patient clearly states he smokes 'a pack a day' [P-37] and has done so since age 15 [P-38]. It also incorrectly interprets the cannabis reference [P-40] as the smoking history. Additionally, it claims occupational history wasn't elicited when the patient clearly states he works as a consultant for a chemical plant in Sarnia [P-33]. These are fundamental misreadings of the transcript that contradict the Gold Answer's accurate representation.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover most key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) the correct smoking history (pack-a-day since age 15), (2) the occupational exposure details and safety measures, (3) the hemoptysis finding (bloody sputum), (4) the connection between risk factors and clinical presentation, (5) the differential diagnosis considerations, and (6) the pathophysiological mechanisms. It only partially addresses the family history. This represents coverage of less than 20% of the Gold Answer's key content.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple hallucinations and misinterpretations. It fabricates that smoking history 'was not elicited' when it clearly was. It conflates cannabis use [P-40] with tobacco smoking [P-36-38]. It invents that 'no information regarding employment was elicited' when this is explicitly discussed [P-33-34]. These are not minor extrapolations but direct contradictions of clearly stated transcript content. The answer is largely unfaithful to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question about risk factors but does so inaccurately. While it discusses family history, smoking, and occupation, it fundamentally misrepresents what was actually elicited. It also spends significant space on irrelevant details (Lipitor, Tylenol, raw throat) while missing the core connection between risk factors and the acute presentation with hemoptysis. The answer is partially on-topic but fails to meaningfully address the question's actual content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates severe deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It contains multiple critical factual errors, most notably completely missing or misrepresenting the patient's pack-a-day smoking history since age 15 and his occupational role at a chemical plant—both of which are clearly stated in the transcript. The answer conflates cannabis use with tobacco smoking and falsely claims key information wasn't elicited. It covers less than 20% of the Gold Answer's key points, omitting hemoptysis, pathophysiological connections, and clinical implications entirely. The response shows poor faithfulness to the source material with multiple hallucinations and misreadings. While attempting to address risk factors, it does so with such fundamental inaccuracy that it fails to meaningfully answer the question posed."
