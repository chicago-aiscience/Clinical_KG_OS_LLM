  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medications (Reactine and OTC) and the lack of prescriptions. However, it incorrectly states that the patient is currently being evaluated for a viral infection; the transcript indicates she had viral infections in the past [P-15], but no diagnosis has been made for the current episode. It also refers to a knowledge graph [KG] not present in the source.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key points from the gold answer, including the specific use of Reactine for allergies, the use of OTC drugs, the lack of prescriptions, and the fact that no medication is taken for current episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates an external source 'knowledge graph [KG]' and misattributes the cause of the current respiratory episode to a viral infection by conflating past medical history [P-15] with current symptoms [P-1].",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and specifically addresses the question about medications and treatments for both current and other conditions."
