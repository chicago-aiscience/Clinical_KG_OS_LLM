  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor DID systematically explore living situation [D-45, D-46], workplace [D-47, D-48], travel [D-49], and sick contacts [D-47, D-50]. The Generated Answer states these were 'not explored' which directly contradicts the transcript evidence. This is a fundamental factual error.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) living situation details (apartment, alone), (2) environmental trigger screening (carpets, dust, mold, pets), (3) workplace details (car dealership), (4) sick contacts at work inquiry, (5) travel inquiry, (6) substance use screening. The Generated Answer covers 0% of the Gold Answer's key content.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains major hallucinations and contradicts the transcript. The claim that exposure sources were 'not explored' is false - the transcript shows explicit questions at D-45 through D-50. The statement about contact tracing is accurate but irrelevant to the question asked. The answer demonstrates lack of grounding in the actual transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question. The question asks what exposure sources were explored; the Generated Answer incorrectly claims they weren't explored at all. While it mentions the four categories from the question, it provides the opposite of what was requested - stating these areas were not investigated when they clearly were."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect and fails on all evaluation dimensions. It falsely claims the doctor did not explore living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts, when the transcript explicitly shows these were systematically investigated through questions D-45 through D-50. The answer covers none of the key details from the Gold Answer (apartment living, environmental triggers, car dealership workplace, etc.) and contradicts verifiable facts from the source transcript. This represents a fundamental misreading or hallucination of the clinical encounter."
