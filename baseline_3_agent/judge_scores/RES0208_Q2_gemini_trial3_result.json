    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all aspects of the multi-part question: the current medications, the specific conditions, the change made to the previous regimen, and the reason for that change. While it omits minor details found in the Gold Answer (like the doctor's reaction or the specific mention that the prostate condition isn't cancer), these were not explicitly requested by the question.",

    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and concise, focusing exclusively on answering the specific questions asked without adding unnecessary information."
