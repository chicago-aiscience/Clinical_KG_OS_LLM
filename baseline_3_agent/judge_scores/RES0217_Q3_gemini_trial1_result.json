{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the duration (>72 hours) and the patient's prior history as key factors. However, it fails to mention the specific geographic location (Strathroy) or the Ontario distribution map mentioned in the transcript and Gold Answer, which were the actual basis for the 'geographic risk assessment.' It also attributes reasoning to a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the provided source text.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific location 'Strathroy' and the use of a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario. 2) The patient's specific observation that all ticks in that area are now considered potential carriers, which addressed the concern about the tick's visual appearance.",
    "faithfulness": "The mention of a 'knowledge graph' [KG: hiking, gardening] is a hallucination as it refers to external data structures not present in the provided transcript. The rest of the answer is well-grounded in the text with accurate citations for the points it does cover.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address the components of the question (duration, history, etc.), though the content within those sections is slightly incomplete."
