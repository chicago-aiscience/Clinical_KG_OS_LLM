  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's diagnosis of 'Asthma (specifically exercise-induced asthma exacerbated by cold weather and allergic rhinitis)' is factually consistent with the Gold Answer's 'pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the context of an atopic predisposition,' with only minor phrasing differences. Key supporting facts like exercise triggers [P-3, P-41], cold weather [P-38], multiple settings [P-38], and seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36] align perfectly. However, it inaccurately frames past viral history [P-15] as a supportive trigger, whereas the Gold Answer uses current negatives to rule out infection, introducing a minor discrepancy.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: diagnosis; exercise triggers [P-3, P-41, P-6]; reversibility [P-6, P-33]; cold weather [P-38]; multiple settings [P-38]; allergies [P-35, P-36]; nocturnal episode [P-43, P-44]; pertinent negatives [P-7, P-8, P-10, P-31]. Generated covers diagnosis, exercise, cold, settings, allergies (~70% of supports), but misses explicit reversibility citations, nocturnal episode, and negatives; adds symptom descriptions and viral history not central to Gold.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited transcript segments [P-1, P-2, P-3, P-32, P-35, P-36, P-38, P-41] are accurate and verifiable. However, references to a 'knowledge graph' (twice: linking allergies/Reactine and wheezing/SOB) are not present in the transcript, representing hallucinated external content. Viral history [P-15] is verifiable but misinterpreted as a current trigger rather than historical. Overall, mostly grounded with some unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly names the diagnosis and lists specific transcript findings with citations addressing the question perfectly; minor additions like knowledge graph and extra symptoms are tangential but do not derail focus."
