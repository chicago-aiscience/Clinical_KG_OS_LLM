  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate on the bullseye rash assessment and absence [D-6, P-6], localized symptoms [P-1], and proposed tests (tick ID, serology, physical exam), with no contradictions to the Gold Answer or transcript. However, it underemphasizes that multiple other Lyme features were assessed (e.g., joint pain, fever) by presenting only the rash as 'specifically assessed,' creating minor discrepancies in scope.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: bullseye rash (yes); tick species ID (yes); blood serology (yes); physical exam (partial, as 'physical exam' vs specific 'bite site'). Missed: joint pain [D-7], fever/illness [D-8], headaches [D-19], feeling well/systemic symptoms [D-18], no other bites [P-9], supervising physician consult [D-13,D-22], no test results note. Covers ~25-40% of key points, mainly one feature and core tests.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript: rash inquiry/denial [D-6,P-6]; bite symptoms [P-1]; tick lab [D-18, cf. D-5,D-6]; serology [D-18]; physical exam [D-18]. Minor unverifiable detail: cites [D-6] for serology/tick sending (actually D-18 primary), but claims grounded overall, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses both parts of the question (features assessed/absent, tests proposed) with structured, focused response and no irrelevant or off-topic content."
