{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the patient's smoking history, COPD diagnosis, and medication (LABA). It correctly identifies the medical logic linking COPD to increased COVID-19 risk, which aligns with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it does not mention that the patient quit smoking two years ago, it fails to note that the difficulty breathing is a new and unique experience for the patient, and it entirely omits the social context (living alone, retired, limited outings) which is included in the Gold Answer as relevant for exposure and isolation planning.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer significantly fails on faithfulness by repeatedly citing a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source materials. While the medical conclusions drawn are plausible, the attribution to a non-existent source constitutes a hallucination of the context. However, it does correctly cite several transcript tags ([P-35], [P-27], [P-28], [D-43]).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and stays focused on explaining the link between smoking, COPD, and current respiratory risks as requested by the prompt."
