  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold states assessment as asthma 'reoccurring in some capacity' top of differential pending exam/findings (D-35). Generated correctly identifies asthma recurrence as primary but presents it more definitively without emphasizing 'pending exam'; minor discrepancy. Generated inaccurately states patient 'utilizes rescue inhalers [P-25]'—transcript shows patient takes daily puffer (likely ICS), hasn't used/needed rescue (salbutamol) in years, no refill (P-17,P-18,P-19). 'Continue to have rescue puffers' wrong—doctor recommends making them available (implying obtain). Cardiac ischemic lower correct (D-36). Some factual errors but core assessment/plan correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) asthma top differential pending exam; 2) quick PE + lung auscultation + further invx if needed; 3) obtain rescue puffers (notes lacks them) for trial on walks; 4) if no help, reassess/other directions/stepwise; 5) consult supervising doc. Generated covers 1 (asthma top), 2 (quick PE + lungs), 3 (rescue trial on walks), 4 (if not effective, reassess/other directions). Misses 'pending exam' nuance, patient lacks rescue, further invx detail, consult doc. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims verifiable: assessment/PE/tx/contingency from D-35/D-36. Citations accurate where used. Minor issues: 'utilizes rescue [P-25]'—P-25 mentions salbutamol but context shows not current rescue use (P-17/18); 'continue' not in transcript (doctor says 'try having those rescue puffers available'); doctor interprets no SOB exercise (D-36) though patient reports dyspnea on exertion. No major hallucinations, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer perfectly structured around question elements: overall assessment, PE components, first-step tx, contingency plan. No tangents, directly addresses all parts of query with clear headings."
