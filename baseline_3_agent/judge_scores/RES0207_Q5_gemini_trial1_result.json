  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer's primary points. It correctly identifies Keppra as the medication, the patient's mother as the family history link, and the patient's admission of missing a dose.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a few supporting details found in the gold answer, specifically the context of the missed dose (the daughter's birthday celebration disrupting the routine) and the mention that the patient's seizures are usually infrequent when medication is taken regularly.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, providing accurate citations (e.g., P-23, P-9, P-26, P-8) for all claims made.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is perfectly relevant, addressing both the risk factors (hereditary and medication-related) and the relationship between family history and the epilepsy diagnosis."
