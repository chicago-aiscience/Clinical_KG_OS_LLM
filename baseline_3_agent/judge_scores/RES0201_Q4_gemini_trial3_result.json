  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses the vast majority of negative findings documented in the transcript and the Gold Answer, including cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, sick contacts, and travel. It also incorrectly cites [P-26] as the patient implying breathing issues, whereas [P-26] refers to the onset of muscle aches. It focuses almost exclusively on smell loss.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer identifies ten distinct negative findings or denied symptoms/history. The Generated Answer only identifies one (loss of smell). It fails to mention the lack of cough and runny nose, which the Gold Answer highlights as key for narrowing the diagnosis away from typical upper respiratory infections.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source context. It also misattributes [P-26] to breathing issues when the transcript clearly associates that turn with muscle aches. The logic regarding Mononucleosis and smell loss is not supported by the transcript's content.",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer attempts to address both parts of the question, its narrow focus on a single symptom (smell loss) makes it largely non-responsive to the requirement to identify the symptoms the doctor 'specifically screened for' (plural)."
