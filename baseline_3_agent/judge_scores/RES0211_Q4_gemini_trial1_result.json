  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by citing [P-1] as the confirmation that Jessica does not have asthma; [P-1] is actually her opening statement about a dry cough and headache (the asthma denial is in [P-29]). It also identifies [D-58] as the point of screening, whereas [D-58] is the doctor summarizing findings at the end of the encounter. It fails to identify any other screened conditions besides asthma, whereas the Gold Answer and transcript show several.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. The prompt specifically asked for conditions 'such as asthma, eczema, allergic reactions requiring an EpiPen, and night sweats.' The Generated Answer only discusses asthma and general viral symptoms. It completely misses eczema, EpiPen usage, night sweats, productive cough, GI symptoms, rashes, and joint pain—all of which are covered in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates that [P-1] contains information about asthma. While it correctly identifies that a brother's illness was discussed, it ignores the vast majority of the 'systematic screening' dialogue present in the transcript (D-5 through D-33).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. While it addresses the differential diagnosis of a cold, it fails to address the specific list of conditions provided in the prompt's examples (eczema, night sweats, etc.), focusing instead on a very narrow subset of the interaction."
