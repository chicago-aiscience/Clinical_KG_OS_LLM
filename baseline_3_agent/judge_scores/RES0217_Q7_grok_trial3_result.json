  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details precise timeline elements like uncertainty of attachment ('don't really know when I got it', hoped from hiking not garden), discovery 'earlier today' due to soreness, doctor's >72h estimate, and specific engorgement contrasts (prior 'quite swollen', current 'pretty small'/'little bit but not as much', doctor's 'not grape'). Generated covers core timeline (Fri hike, Sat garden, discovery behind knee, container, >72h) and comparison (prior rash/abx/swollen, current less severe/no rash/less swelling), but has minor discrepancies: invalid [KG] citation, attributes 'stuck pretty good' to engorgement (embedding, not size), omits hope for hiking origin and soreness as discovery trigger, misses doctor's grape confirmation. Core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: hiking Fri/gardening Sat, discovery location/container, >72h est, prior ~10y bullseye rash/abx/quite swollen, current red/tender/no rash/smaller engorgement/less severe. Missed/partial: exact uncertainty/hope hiking-not-garden, 'earlier today'/soreness trigger for discovery, 'sore in one spot', P-4/D-4 small tick confirmation. Covers ~85-90% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: timeline/activities [P-1], >72h [D-6], location/symptoms [P-1/P-6], prior details/comparison [P-3], small tick [P-4 implied]. Minor issues: [KG] not in transcript (hallucination/typo), 'manageable symptoms' plausible but not quoted, slight stretch on 'tick did not look like past one' (refers to symptoms). No major fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around timeline (hiking->gardening->discovery/presentation) and comparison (current local symptoms/engorgement vs prior rash/abx), matching question precisely with no off-topic content."
