  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate based on the transcript. It correctly identifies the timeline for the cough (4-5 days) and the runny nose (last couple of days), and correctly notes the lack of improvement in the cough and the clear nature of the nasal discharge.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer and the prompt. It fails to explicitly mention that the cough was 'dry', which was specifically requested in the prompt. More importantly, it misses the patient's direct comparison in [P-24] where they state they have never had a dry cough like this before and that previous runny noses did not last this long. Instead, it focuses on fever and asthma history for the comparison.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is present in the transcript and correctly attributed.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant, but it includes a section on 'Planned Interventions' (chest X-ray and COVID swab) which was not requested by the question regarding symptom development and history."

  "summary": "The answer is factually sound but incomplete as it misses the specific 'dry' characteristic of the cough and the patient's direct comparison of current vs. past symptom duration, while adding irrelevant information about planned tests."
