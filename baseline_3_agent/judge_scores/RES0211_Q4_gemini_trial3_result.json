  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that asthma was screened for, but it attributes the confirmation to [P-1], which is the patient's opening statement about a dry cough and headache, rather than [P-29]. It also focuses on the doctor's summary [D-58] rather than the actual targeted questioning. It misses all other specific conditions (eczema, EpiPen/allergic reactions, night sweats, GI issues, etc.) mentioned in both the prompt and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. The prompt specifically asked for conditions like asthma, eczema, allergic reactions requiring an EpiPen, and night sweats. The Generated Answer only addresses asthma and then pivots to general symptoms of a cold and exposure history, completely omitting eczema, EpiPen requirements, night sweats, and the several other differential screenings (GI, joint pain, productive cough) included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination regarding the transcript: it claims [P-1] confirms Jessica does not have asthma, whereas [P-1] is actually the patient's initial description of her symptoms. The actual confirmation is at [P-29].",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it addresses the general topic of screening, it fails to address the specific conditions explicitly listed in the prompt's parenthetical (eczema, EpiPen, night sweats). It focuses more on the final diagnosis (viral URI) than the systematic screening process requested by the question."
