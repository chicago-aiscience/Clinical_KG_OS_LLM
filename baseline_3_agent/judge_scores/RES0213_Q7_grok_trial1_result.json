  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer provides a precise timeline: smoking start at ~18, overlapping teen anxiety discussed with doctor, 8-year gap without anxiety, past 2 years escalated to 10 cigs/day, few months ago reduced to 5, dad's recent heart attack causing fear, recent weeks thesis stress escalation, 1.5 weeks ago new chest pain onset, with links to stress/anxiety return. Generated Answer covers core phases (teen anxiety, smoking reduction, recent stress, chest pain onset) accurately but starts with anxiety instead of smoking, omits smoking start age/escalation details, 8-year gap, dad's heart attack, and anxiety return; adds interpretive links that align but minor order discrepancy; core facts consistent, minor omissions/discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: teen anxiety [P-21], smoking reduction to 5/day [P-13/14/18 partial], recent weeks stress/thesis [P-15/16], chest pain 1.5 weeks ago [P-2/3]; relationships via stress-anxiety-chest pain. Missed: smoking start at 18 [P-18], 2-year escalation to 10/day [P-18], few months ago cut-down specifics, 8-year anxiety gap [P-22], dad's heart attack/fear [P-8/30], anxiety possibly returning [P-22], pain noticeable when alone [P-9/29]. Covers ~60-70% of key timeline details and relations.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable: teen anxiety [P-21], smoking quit attempt/reduction [P-13/14/18], stress/thesis [P-13/15/16], chest pain details/onset [P-1/2/3/6/17], links to stress [P-8/19], anxiety history [P-20/21/22]; citations accurate. Minor issue: references 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript) for SOB/heart flutter (which are in [P-19/20]); 'smoking as risk factor' is general knowledge, not hallucinated facts but slightly extraneous; mostly grounded with accurate transcript support.",
    "relevance": "Directly traces timeline of history phases (anxiety, smoking, stress, chest pain) with relations (stress triggers anxiety-like symptoms and chest pain), addressing question's sequence (though starts with anxiety not smoking); includes how phases connect via stress progression; minor tangent on KG/risk factors but focused on question."
