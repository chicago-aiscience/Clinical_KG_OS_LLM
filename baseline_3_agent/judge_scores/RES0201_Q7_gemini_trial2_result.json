  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It states the sore throat remained 'pretty constant' when the transcript explicitly says it was 'getting worse' [P-4]. It claims the sense of smell was 'entirely lost,' whereas the patient stated 'not smell' [P-19], meaning it was unaffected. It also incorrectly lists the onset of taste changes as 'immediately after' the sore throat, while the transcript says 'two days ago' [P-20].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two major symptoms: difficulty breathing (the most alarming symptom, which started 'yesterday' [P-8]) and muscle aches/fatigue (which started 'immediately after' the sore throat [P-26]). It only covers about 50-60% of the symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the patient lost their sense of smell. It also misattributes citations: P-21 (referring to taste) is used to describe the sore throat, and P-26 (referring to muscle aches) is used to describe taste/smell onset.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to follow a chronological structure as requested, it fails to include the most critical symptom (difficulty breathing) and provides an inaccurate timeline for the others, reducing its utility as a clinical summary of symptom progression."
