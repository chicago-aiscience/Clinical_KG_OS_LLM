  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all core facts from the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52], including the COVID-19 swab test with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and all supportive care elements (hydration, nutrition, rest, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Minor issues: retains transcript's 'anseads' typo (Gold corrects to NSAIDs), omits alternative diagnosis of 'another viral illness,' and does not explicitly state 'no prescription medications beyond supportive measures,' but these are minor discrepancies with core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnostic test (swab, timeline), isolation duration (14 days), contact tracing condition (if positive), all supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleeping well, Tylenol for fevers, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Missed: explicit alternative diagnosis mention ('another viral illness if negative') and 'no prescription medications beyond supportive.' Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] with accurate citations. Symptoms overlap noted is grounded in patient history and doctor's statement. Minor issue: 'knowledge graph' reference not in transcript (potential hallucination, but does not affect claims). 'Anseads' is faithful to transcript misspelling. No significant fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Answer is perfectly structured around the question's specified elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), with no off-topic content or tangents."
