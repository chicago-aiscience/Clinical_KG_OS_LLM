  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it claims that the doctor's concluding remarks (D-turns) are not included in the provided text. However, D-33 is clearly present in the source transcript and contains the stated plan. Consequently, the answer fails to provide the 'stated plan' requested in the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 100% of the information regarding the stated plan (history-taking/triage, relaying findings to another physician). Regarding the clinical information, it covers the symptoms, medication trials, and history well, but it completely misses the 'pertinent negatives' (trauma, fever, asthma, family sudden death) included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the transcript is incomplete or truncated. The claim that the specific stated plan cannot be determined is directly contradicted by the presence of D-33 in the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The answer only addresses the second part of the two-part question. Because it incorrectly assumes information is missing, it does not provide a relevant response to the first half of the prompt regarding the stated plan."
