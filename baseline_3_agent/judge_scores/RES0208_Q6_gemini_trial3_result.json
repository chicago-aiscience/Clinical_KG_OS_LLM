  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer regarding the management plan, diagnostic tests (X-ray, swab), physical examination, and isolation protocols. It correctly identifies the role of the Public Health Nurse and the 24-48 hour timeline.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers every component requested in the question: diagnostic tests, physical exam details, specific isolation instructions, the source of instructions, timeline, and hospital admission criteria. It misses no key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript. However, there are minor citation errors: it attributes the chest X-ray and physical examination to [D-36], whereas these are actually discussed by the doctor in [D-37]. The facts themselves are present in the text, but the specific turn mapping is slightly off for the initial diagnostic plan.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, providing a structured breakdown that directly addresses each part of the multi-part clinical question without including unnecessary information."
