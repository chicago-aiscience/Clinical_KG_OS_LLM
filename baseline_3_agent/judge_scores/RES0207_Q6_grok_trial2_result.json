  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims there are no doctor turns in the transcript and that it cuts off at [P-26], which is false as the transcript includes [D-1] to [D-38], with [D-37] and [D-38] directly addressing the next steps as described in the Gold Answer. This is a complete factual contradiction, as the Gold Answer accurately cites the relevant doctor statements about consulting another doctor, returning shortly, and discussing tests or next steps.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: doctor will review info with 'the doctor who's working today' [D-37], collaborative decision-making, come back shortly to discuss tests/move forward [D-37,D-38], no specific tests ordered, patient agreement [P-37]. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying transcript content and speculating on unrelated inferences like medication management or symptom investigation.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript has no [D-X] turns and ends at [P-26], which is entirely untrue—multiple doctor turns exist, including the critical [D-37] and [D-38]. All claims about transcript content are fabricated; inferences are not grounded in doctor's communication.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly refuses to address the question by claiming insufficient transcript (falsely), then pivots to off-topic clinical inferences not communicated by the doctor, failing to describe the actual next steps mentioned."
