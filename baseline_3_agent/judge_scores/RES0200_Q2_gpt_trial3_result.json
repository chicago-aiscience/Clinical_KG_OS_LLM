  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple factual inaccuracies versus the Gold Answer/transcript:\n- It omits atorvastatin (“Torva Staten”) as a current non-respiratory medication [P-38].\n- It incorrectly lists the diuretic as an **existing/current** medication. The transcript indicates the patient **used to** take a diuretic for blood pressure but **stopped** [P-34–P-36].\n- It incorrectly states the patient did not provide a specific Ventolin frequency; the patient quantified use as “almost like 10 times this past week” [P-12].\n- It correctly identifies that the patient discontinued the blood-pressure diuretic without physician approval [P-36], though the explanation is somewhat muddled.\nGiven these errors (especially Ventolin frequency and current medication list), correctness is low.",
    "completeness": "Key elements required by the question/Gold Answer:\n- Respiratory inhalers prior to visit: Ventolin and Spiriva — **covered**.\n- Ventolin use frequency in past week: ~10 times — **missed/incorrectly stated as not provided**.\n- Non-respiratory meds currently taking: atorvastatin — **missed**.\n- Previously prescribed med stopped without approval: diuretic for BP — **covered**.\nOverall, only part of the required medication list is included and the Ventolin frequency is not provided, so coverage is well under 80%.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded accurately in the transcript:\n- “Non-respiratory drugs: … taking a diuretic” is not supported; the transcript indicates past use and discontinuation [P-34–P-36].\n- “Did not provide a specific frequency” contradicts [P-12], where the patient provides a numeric estimate.\nThe answer is therefore only partially faithful, with multiple misinterpretations of clearly stated transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic (meds prior to visit, Ventolin frequency, and self-discontinued med), but it fails to supply the requested Ventolin frequency and misstates the patient’s current meds. It is relevant in intent but only partially answers the question as asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is on-topic but contains multiple substantive errors (misses atorvastatin, misclassifies the diuretic as current, and denies the clearly stated Ventolin frequency), making it incomplete and poorly faithful to the transcript."
