{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies chronic cough for 10 years [P-3], but Generated cites only 'normally have' [P-1] without timeline; COPD diagnosis clarified to ~5 years [P-2], but Generated uses initial 'couple years ago' [P-1]; cough worsening and sputum change to yellow correctly noted as last week [P-1, P-5, P-6]; acute SOB as last few days correct [P-1, P-8]; misses baseline intermittent SOB [P-8] and chills [P-29]. Some factual discrepancies on chronic timelines but recent acute events accurate.",
    "completeness": "Covers: cough chronic (partial), COPD diagnosis (partial), cough worsen last week, sputum change last week, acute SOB last few days. Misses: precise 10-year cough onset, 5-year COPD clarification, baseline SOB with puffers, chills last couple days. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in cited transcript sections [P-1, P-6]; sputum description minor paraphrase but accurate ('clear to yellow/white' before vs 'more yellow' now matches [P-6]); no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly traces timeline in bullet points addressing chronic cough, COPD diagnosis, recent worsening (cough/sputum), and acute SOB, perfectly matching question's requested elements without off-topic content."
