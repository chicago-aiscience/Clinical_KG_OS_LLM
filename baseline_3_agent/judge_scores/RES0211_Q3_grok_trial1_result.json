  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key symptoms like dry cough [P-1, P-4], scratchy throat [P-1, P-4], headache [P-1], and implies subjective fever via doctor's summary [D-58], aligning with Gold's core facts. It addresses absence of sputum (though misattributes to [D-58] instead of [P-5, P-6]) and vaguely covers GI/joint pain absences as exclusion of systemic symptoms. However, errors include introducing 'Knowledge Graph' (not in Gold or transcript), specifying 'common cold' (Gold says URI), incorrect citation of doctor's sputum question in [D-58] (actual questions in [D-5, D-6]), and omitting Gold's details like timeline, malaise, fatigue, brother's cold. Some factual errors but main point of symptom support for URI correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: scratchy throat [P-4], dry cough [P-1,P-4], subjective fever [P-7,P-9], headache [P-1,P-2], malaise [P-14,D-15], fatigue [P-13], 3-4 days [P-1,P-3], no sputum/phlegm [P-5,P-6], no nausea/vomiting [P-11], no diarrhea [P-12], no joint pain [P-13], brother's cold [P-39], doctor summary [D-58]. Generated covers dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, feeling crappy (partial malaise), absence sputum, vague GI/joint exclusion; misses explicit fever description, timeline, fatigue, malaise characterization, brother's exposure. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms citations [P-1,P-4] verifiable. Absence of sputum verifiable [P-5,P-6] but wrongly cited to [D-58] (summary, not question). 'Knowledge Graph' entirely fabricated/not in transcript. Misattributes sputum question to [D-58]. 'Common cold' plausible but not stated by doctor. Systemic exclusions plausible from denials [P-11-P-13] but phrased as patient not listing (doctor elicits). Multiple hallucinated/unverifiable elements like Knowledge Graph and citation error.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how listed symptoms and absences support URI assessment via structured points on indicators, sputum absence differentiating from lower respiratory, and systemic exclusion; minor tangent with 'Knowledge Graph' but stays on-topic."
