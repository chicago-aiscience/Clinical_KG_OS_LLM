  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the COVID swab test, 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation including from sister, false negative possibility, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and all specific warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms/seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). The information is factually consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: (1) COVID swab test, (2) turnaround time, (3) 14-day isolation recommendation, (4) false negative possibility, (5) alternative viral illness diagnosis if negative, (6) specific ER warning signs with examples. However, it omits the doctor's note about asthma being considered if only cough/shortness of breath without fever [D-45], and doesn't explicitly state 'no medications prescribed' or 'watchful waiting approach'. These are minor omissions but represent approximately 10-15% of the Gold Answer content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [D-44, D-45]. The isolation recommendation, test turnaround time, alternative diagnosis, and warning signs are all grounded in the doctor's statements. No hallucinated information is present. The answer appropriately uses direct quotes and paraphrases from the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the multi-part question: diagnostic test ordered, turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negative possibility, and warning signs with examples. The answer is well-organized according to the question structure and contains no off-topic content. Every element responds specifically to what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-organized response that covers nearly all key elements of the doctor's assessment and management plan. It correctly identifies the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation including from sister, false negative acknowledgment, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and all specific ER warning signs. All information is faithfully grounded in the transcript with proper citations. Minor deductions for completeness due to omitting the asthma differential note and not explicitly mentioning the watchful waiting approach without medications, which represent 10-15% of the Gold Answer content."
