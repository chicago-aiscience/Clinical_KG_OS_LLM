  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the assessment (symptoms in line with COVID-19), the diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), the isolation protocol (until results return), and the condition for extended isolation (continued symptoms even if negative).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the specific components requested in the prompt: assessment, diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, and conditions for continued isolation. It misses minor contextual details present in the gold answer, such as the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician and the patient's underlying COPD as context for the chest X-ray, but these were not explicitly demanded by the prompt's specific list.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically turn [D-43]. There are no hallucinations or external information introduced.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the prompt closely. It provides a clear, categorized response to each part of the question without irrelevant tangents."
