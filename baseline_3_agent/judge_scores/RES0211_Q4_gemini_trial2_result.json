  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the transcript: it claims Jessica confirmed she does not have asthma in [P-1], but [P-1] describes her symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache). The actual denial of asthma occurs in [P-29]. Furthermore, it fails to identify almost all conditions mentioned in the prompt (eczema, night sweats, EpiPen/severe allergies) and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. It missed three out of the four specific conditions explicitly listed in the prompt's parenthetical examples (eczema, allergic reactions/EpiPen, and night sweats). It also missed several other conditions mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as productive cough, GI symptoms, joint pain, and skin changes. It focuses heavily on the final diagnosis rather than the screening process requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that [P-1] excludes asthma is a hallucination/misattribution, as that part of the transcript is about current symptoms. While the general conclusion that she doesn't have asthma is true based on other parts of the transcript ([P-29]), the specific grounding provided is incorrect.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. It addresses 'asthma' but ignores the other specific examples provided in the prompt (night sweats, eczema, EpiPen). It shifts focus toward explaining why she has a cold rather than answering the specific question about systematic screening for other conditions."
