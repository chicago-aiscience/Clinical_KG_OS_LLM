  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition both identified, with matching citations [P-1] and [D-39]; specifies the swab test (aligning with Gold's 'COVID swab'); turnaround time of 48 hours [D-39]; and isolation instructions [D-39]. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., Gold specifies 'today' for the test, but core facts match). No errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 identified by both (covered); (2) COVID swab test 'today' (swab covered, 'today' implied but not explicit); (3) 48 hours turnaround (covered); (4) stay isolated/not see anyone else (covered); (5) further instructions from public health (missed). Covers ~90% of key points, missing minor details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: patient concern [P-1], doctor's statements on COVID symptoms, swab today, 48 hours, isolation [D-39]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question's four elements (condition, test, turnaround, instructions) in a structured, bullet-point format with no off-topic content or tangents."
