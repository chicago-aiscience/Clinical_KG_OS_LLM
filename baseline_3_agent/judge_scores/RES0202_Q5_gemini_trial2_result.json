  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a factual error regarding the onset of symptoms, stating the cough developed on Thursday, whereas the transcript [P-1] says it started Wednesday night. It also includes an external reference to a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the clinical facts provided in the transcript. However, the core conclusion about the school being the suspected source is correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific detail that the mother was certain ('for sure') about no contacts outside of school. 2) The school's requirement for a COVID test to return and the purpose of notifying other families. 3) The exclusion of other potential sources like travel or home environmental factors (mold/asbestos) which strengthened the school-source theory.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' to explain symptom associations. It also incorrectly cites [P-1] for the school notification information, which actually appears in [P-39]. Furthermore, it misrepresents the timeline of the cough onset relative to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the prompt's questions regarding school attendance, sick contacts, and school notifications."
