  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details onset one week prior, initial stuffy nose shifting to mostly runny, possible decongestant influence, initial 'on and off' description reconciled with later 'pretty constant' clarification suggesting continuous symptoms overall, and no improvement. Generated Answer correctly captures onset, initial stuffy nose first then shift to runny, but inaccurately emphasizes only the initial 'on and off' as intermittent without mentioning or reconciling the explicit 'pretty constant' report, omitting decongestant influence and lack of improvement. Core progression facts match, but errors in symptom pattern representation.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1-week onset [P-1,P-2]; initial congestion [P-3]; shift to rhinorrhea [P-3]; decongestant influence [P-10]; initial 'on and off' [P-1]; clarified 'pretty constant' [P-8]; overall continuous; no improvement [P-1]. Generated covers: onset, initial stuffy first, shift to runny, initial 'on and off'. Misses: decongestant, constant clarification, continuous interpretation, no improvement. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated (1-week onset [P-2], 'on and off' [P-1], stuffy first to mostly running [P-3]) directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around onset, symptom sequence (first stuffy, shift to runny), and intermittency, precisely matching question elements on progression, first symptom, change in predominant symptom, and pattern, with no off-topic content."
