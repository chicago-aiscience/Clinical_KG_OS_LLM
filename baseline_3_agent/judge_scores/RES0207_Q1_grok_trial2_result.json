  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the sudden shortness of breath [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure the previous night [P-8], and fever measurement of 37.4°C [P-5], all fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: sudden-onset shortness of breath [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure [P-8], fever of 37.4°C [P-5]. Key points missed: shortness of breath upon waking and ~3 hours prior to consultation [P-1, P-11], cough onset that morning [D-2, P-2], explicit no sputum [P-4], underlying epilepsy [P-8], felt fine after seizure and went to bed [P-8], fever described as mild and confirmed as morning measurement [P-5, P-6], pertinent negatives (no prior SOB [P-3], no chest pain [P-7], no faintness [P-8], no sore throat [P-20], no runny nose [P-21]). Covers approximately 50-60% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer (sudden SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure previous night [P-8], temperature 37.4°C [P-5]) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured around the exact elements of the question—respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and fever measurement—with no off-topic content."
