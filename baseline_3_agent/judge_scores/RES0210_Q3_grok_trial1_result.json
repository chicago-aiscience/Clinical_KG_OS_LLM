  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Generated accurately describes productive cough with yellow 'custard' sputum [P-6] and red spots [P-4], matching Gold; systemic fever (cites P-5, Gold P-8/P-5) and chills [P-9] consistent; right-sided chest pain [P-17] noted. However, incorrectly cites P-15 (sore throat 'raw' after coughing) for pleuritic chest pain worsening, while true details are in P-18/P-19 (deep breath/cough); misses exertional dyspnea [P-10/P-11] and smoking [P-37/P-38]; adds Tylenol [P-14] not emphasized in Gold. Pleuritic pathophysio similar but less precise on constant dull pain [P-20/P-21]. Some factual errors and omissions, but core points correct. Score: 3",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Productive purulent sputum + red spots [P-4/P-6]: covered; 2) Fever [P-8] + chills [P-9]: covered; 3) Exertional dyspnea [P-10/P-11]: completely missed; 4) Right chest pain constant/dull [P-20/P-21], worsens deep breath/cough [P-18/P-19], persists lying [P-20]: partially (location + worsening, misses constant/persists); 5) Pleuritic pleural inflammation/right localization: covered in explanation; 6) Smoking risk [P-37/P-38]: missed. Covers ~60% of keys (cough, systemic, basic pain/pleuritic). Score: 3",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: cough [P-1], sputum [P-4/P-6], fever/chills [P-5/P-9], pain location [P-17], Tylenol [P-14]. Error: P-15 ('raw' after coughing) is sore throat, not chest pain—misrepresentation/hallucination for pleuritic worsening (actual [P-18/P-19]); 'sputum likely from right lung' inferred/plausible but not direct; pathophysio derived, not verbatim. Minor hallucinations from mis-citation, mostly grounded. Score: 3",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by listing specific transcript findings (cough/sputum, fever/chills, pain) supporting pneumonia and explaining pleuritic pain's diagnostic role with pathophysio; focused, no tangents. Score: 5"
