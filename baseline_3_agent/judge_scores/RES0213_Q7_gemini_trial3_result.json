  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the current symptoms and the teenage history of anxiety. However, it fails to mention the patient's father's heart attack, which is a significant part of the patient's relevant history and current anxiety. It also attributes certain symptoms like 'heart flutter' to a 'knowledge graph' rather than the patient's own report in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific age (18) when smoking began; 2) The specific smoking history of 10 cigarettes/day for the last two years; 3) The significant detail of the father's heart attack occurring last year; 4) The specific 8-year gap in anxiety symptoms; and 5) The relationship regarding symptoms being worse when alone.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the provided source transcript. While most clinical facts are accurate to the transcript, referencing an external data structure constitutes a minor hallucination/grounding error. The medical claims themselves (smoking as a risk factor) are plausible but not explicitly discussed as such by the doctor in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question's request to trace the history, but it fails to follow the specific instruction to 'start from when she began smoking' by omitting the start age (18). It focuses well on the relationship between stress and pain but ignores the familial history component requested by the prompt's 'relevant history' scope.
