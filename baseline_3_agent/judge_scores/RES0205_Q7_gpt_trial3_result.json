  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most statements align with the Gold Answer/transcript: 2-week duration; initial flu-like symptoms early; mucus described as whitish/clear for ~4–5 days; then cough became dry and persisted; chest soreness with heavy coughing. However, the answer introduces some imprecision: it implies flu-like symptoms were present for the “first two or three days” and “resolved entirely within the first three or four days” without distinguishing sore throat (2–3 days) vs other symptoms (3–4 days). It also states the cough frequency “remained high throughout,” which is not stated; the transcript says frequency did not increase and gives an estimate (3–4 times/hour).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: overall 2-week timeline; early flu-like symptoms; mucus duration and appearance; transition to dry cough; persistence of cough; chest soreness with coughing.\nMissing or insufficiently covered: (1) explicit mention of sore throat and runny nose and their distinct resolution timing; (2) explicit statement that there were no fevers; (3) cough intensity stayed the same (not better/worse); (4) cough frequency stayed stable and specific estimate (3–4 times/hour); (5) spontaneous/no triggers; (6) COVID test timing/result and staying home awaiting improvement. Overall coverage is partial (~50–79%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in cited transcript lines (P-14, P-13, P-6, P-2, P-15). The main partially ungrounded element is characterization that cough frequency “remained high throughout,” which is not directly supported (only stability/no increase is stated, with a numeric estimate). No major hallucinated events, but some details requested by the question are omitted rather than fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested symptom-progression timeline (onset, mucus, transition to dry cough, resolution of other symptoms, cough effects). It is relevant, but it does not fully answer the question’s requested elements (frequency/intensity trend, triggers, fever absence, COVID test), reducing overall responsiveness."

  "summary": "The generated answer is mostly accurate and on-topic but omits several key timeline details (fever absence, intensity/frequency stability with estimate, triggers, COVID test) and contains minor imprecision about symptom resolution and cough frequency characterization."
