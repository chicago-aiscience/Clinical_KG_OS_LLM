  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma and links it to exercise-induced triggers, cold weather, and allergies, which is consistent with the Gold Answer. The citations to the transcript for the symptoms provided are accurate.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses three significant points from the Gold Answer: the evidence for spontaneous resolution with rest (which was explicitly mentioned in the prompt), nocturnal symptoms, and the pertinent negatives (lack of fever/phlegm) used to rule out infection. It covers about 50-60% of the key points found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally grounded in the transcript; however, it repeatedly refers to a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source material, suggesting a hallucination regarding the available resources. Otherwise, the clinical claims are supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant as it addresses the diagnosis and provides supporting evidence. However, it fails to provide transcript evidence for the 'resolution with rest' finding that was specifically mentioned in the prompt's list of findings to justify."
