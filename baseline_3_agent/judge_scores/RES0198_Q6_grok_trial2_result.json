  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript: diagnosis as viral infection/common cold, supportive care (hydration and OTC like Tylenol Cold), swab for COVID with 48-hour results, and isolation until results. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'confirm or rule out' infers symptom overlap) are consistent and not erroneous.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnosis (viral/common cold), supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (COVID swab, 48 hours), public health (isolation at home, avoid others until results). Missed: explicit 'swab done today', 'symptoms take a few weeks to resolve', 'not much besides supportive care', and 'further instructions from public health' (covers ~85% of details).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-39]: viral infection/common cold, stay hydrated, Tylenol Cold OTC, pandemic context/swab for COVID (symptoms overlap), 48-hour results, isolate at home/not see others. No hallucinations; structured summary grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to match question's request (diagnosis, specific supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance) with no off-topic content or tangents."
