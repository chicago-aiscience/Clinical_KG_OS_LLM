  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by stating that the specific questions asked for in the prompt (fever, runny nose, sick contacts) were not present in the transcript. In reality, these are clearly present in the provided text (D-7, D-8, D-10, D-11, D-13, D-31). Consequently, it fails to identify the conditions the doctor was screening for (pneumonia, URTI, contagious etiologies, etc.) as detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It does not explain what the questions about fever, runny nose, travel, rashes, or phlegm were intended to screen for or exclude. It focuses instead on the patient's existing history of allergies and cold weather triggers, which only partially addresses the 'narrowing the differential' part of the question while ignoring the primary screening logic requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript is missing segments. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' multiple times, which is not part of the source transcript or the provided context. These are external hallucinations that detract from the grounding in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely off-topic because it fails to answer the specific 'why' behind the doctor's screening questions. While it attempts to discuss the narrowing of the diagnosis, it does so based on different evidence than what the prompt specifically requested (the doctor's specific screening questions)."
