  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly accurate. It correctly identifies the history of asthma and the presenting symptoms. It also correctly notes the exclusion of cardiac ischemia. However, it states the patient is currently taking salbutamol based on P-25, but the transcript (P-17, P-18) clarifies that the patient hasn't refilled the rescue inhaler (salbutamol) in years and only takes a 'daily one,' which is a distinction the doctor notes in the synthesis.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The significance of the patient skipping his evening maintenance dose and having no rescue inhaler available (medication non-adherence), which the doctor explicitly summarizes in D-34. 2) The patient's own acknowledgement that it might be related to asthma despite feeling 'different.' 3) The lack of new environmental triggers. 4) The use of a therapeutic trial (rescue puffers) to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in the transcript. The use of P-25 to say the patient takes salbutamol is technically in the text, though it lacks the context found earlier in the dialogue regarding the lack of a refill.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question, structuring the response into symptoms, history, and the diagnostic link."
