  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for cholesterol, matching Gold [P-25, P-26], and Tylenol with partial effectiveness ['helps a little bit' [P-14]]. However, it inaccurately attributes specific conditions to Tylenol (fever, sore throat, chest pain) via a non-existent 'knowledge graph' rather than patient-reported symptom relief for feeling feverish/unwell, and does not note it as the only prescribed medication or specify atorvastatin. Minor discrepancies but core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: Lipitor for cholesterol, Tylenol taken and its partial effectiveness. Misses explicit confirmation of Lipitor as the only prescribed medication [P-27], precise Gold phrasing for Tylenol (symptom relief for feverish/unwell, acetaminophen), no other meds mentioned, and non-medication relief [P-13]; covers ~80-90% of core medication-related points.",
    "faithfulness": "Lipitor claims and citations [P-25, P-26] verifiable; Tylenol mention and effectiveness [P-14] verifiable in transcript. However, 'knowledge graph' references, Lipitor linked to [MEDICAL_HISTORY], and Tylenol's specific uses (fever, sore throat, chest pain) are not in transcript (plausible general knowledge but hallucinated attribution); minor quote inaccuracy ('haven't taken some'). Some unverifiable but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists prescribed (Lipitor) and OTC (Tylenol) meds with conditions and OTC effectiveness, perfectly matching question structure; minor extraneous 'knowledge graph' but no significant off-topic content."
