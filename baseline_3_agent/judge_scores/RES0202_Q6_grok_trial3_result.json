  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript without errors or contradictions. It correctly describes the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation including sister, false negative possibility, alternative of another viral illness/infection, and exact warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weak/dizzy, fainting). References to [D-44] and [D-45] are precise, and no new incorrect facts are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) assessment as viral/COVID-like infection (missed explicitly, only implied); (2) COVID swab/24-48h (covered); (3) 14-day isolation incl. sister (covered); (4) false negatives (covered); (5) alt dx another viral illness (covered); (6) warning signs with examples (covered fully); (7) asthma note if no fever (missed); (8) no meds/watchful waiting (missed). Covers core plan elements (80-99%), misses assessment summary, asthma differential, and no-meds note.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: swab/turnaround/isolation/false neg/alt dx/warnings all from [D-44]; infection from [D-45]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated content; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around exact elements requested (test/turnaround, isolation, alt dx/false neg, warning signs), with clear headings matching query components; no off-topic content."
