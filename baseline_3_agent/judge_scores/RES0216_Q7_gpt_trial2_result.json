  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly notes a ~3-day duration and that symptoms worsen with walking/dog-walking, and that tightness occurs with breathing in. However, it contains important inaccuracies versus the Gold Answer/transcript: (1) it states the trend over three days is not explicitly stated, but the patient clearly says it is “staying the same”/“pretty steady” (P-2, P-3); (2) it says the patient continues his daily walking routine, but the patient reports reducing from a couple walks/day to usually one walk/day due to symptoms (P-22). It also omits that symptoms first appeared while on a walk (P-4) and that there was no trigger (P-3), which affects the developmental timeline asked in the question.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements missing: first noticed while on a walk (P-4); no specific trigger/“just kind of came on” (P-3); progression staying the same (P-2, P-3); baseline constant tightness with exacerbations (P-9, P-10); specific exacerbators beyond walking (getting up from a chair; big breath in) (P-9); functional impact of reducing walks from a couple/day to one/day (P-22), and that it didn’t cause missed work and only mildly limited day-to-day function (P-21 to P-23). Included elements: ~3 days duration, inspiratory tightness, worse with walking/dog-walking. Overall coverage is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s required points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (3-day duration; inspiratory tightness; worse on walks; hoarseness/phlegm). However, there are multiple statements that conflict with the transcript: claiming the trend is not stated (it is), and implying the walking routine is unchanged (it is reduced). These are not \"hallucinated\" details but are misrepresentations of the transcript content, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response generally targets the question (onset, triggers, impact), but it fails to address several required components (trend over time, specific non-walking exacerbators, and the documented reduction in walking frequency). It also adds minor irrelevant detail (hoarseness/phlegm; “knowledge graph”) not asked in the question."
