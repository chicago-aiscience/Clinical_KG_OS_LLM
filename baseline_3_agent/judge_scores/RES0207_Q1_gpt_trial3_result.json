{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reports the patient’s sudden shortness of breath, dry cough, seizure the prior night, and measured temperature of 37.4°C. These are all consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript, with no contradictions or incorrect additions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: sudden shortness of breath, cough described as dry (implying no sputum), seizure the previous night, and objective fever measurement of 37.4°C. Missing compared with the Gold Answer: explicit statement that the cough also began suddenly that morning, the approximate 3-hour symptom duration estimate, the explicit mention of underlying epilepsy, and that the patient felt fine after the seizure. (Some of these are context beyond what the question strictly requires, but they are present in the Gold Answer.)",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate bracketed references; no clear hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked respiratory and neurologic symptoms and the objective fever measurement, without tangents."
