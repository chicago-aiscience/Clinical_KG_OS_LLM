  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) with accurate citations. However, it contains a major factual error: it claims the doctor did NOT screen for fever, joint pain, or headaches, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor asked about joint pain [D-7, P-7], fever/feeling ill [D-8, P-8], and headaches [D-19, P-19, P-20]. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the local symptoms well but completely omits the critical information about systemic screening. The Gold Answer explicitly states the doctor screened for joint pain, fever/illness, and headaches - all of which the patient denied. The Generated Answer fails to include this entire component, missing approximately 40% of the required content.",
    "faithfulness": "The local symptom descriptions are faithful to the transcript with accurate citations. However, the claim that 'the doctor did not explicitly screen for fever, joint pain, or headaches' is a hallucination that contradicts the transcript. The exchanges [D-7]/[P-7] for joint pain, [D-8]/[P-8] for fever/illness, and [D-19]/[P-19, P-20] for headaches are clearly present in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question's structure by attempting to cover both local and systemic symptoms. However, the second part provides incorrect information rather than answering what was actually screened for and denied, making half the response misleading despite being topically relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately describes local symptoms at the tick bite site with proper citations, but contains a critical factual error by claiming the doctor did not screen for fever, joint pain, and headaches when the transcript clearly shows these screenings occurred (with the patient denying all). This omission of the entire systemic screening component represents a major gap in completeness and introduces hallucinated content that contradicts the source material."
