  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient takes Keppra and that the patient linked the seizure to forgetting their medication, citing the key quote from P-9 (“I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have yeah”). However, it overstates causality by asserting the missed dose is “causally linked… because non-adherence… is a known precipitant,” which is general medical knowledge and not established within the transcript; the Gold Answer explicitly notes there is no clinician-confirmed causality and that the connection is based on the patient’s recognition. So the core point is right, but the rationale is slightly misframed/overconfident relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures one main required evidence element (P-9 quote showing the patient recognized the link) and mentions Keppra (P-23). It misses several key Gold Answer points: (1) temporal connection that the seizure happened the same night as the missed dose, (2) the context explaining why the dose was missed (daughter’s birthday/disrupted dinner routine, P-24), (3) that the patient offered the attribution voluntarily in response to a question not directly about adherence (D-9→P-9), (4) the ‘seizures are usually rare for me’ remark implying the episode was unusual/triggered (P-9), and (5) the Gold’s caution that there is no clinician assessment confirming causality. Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "The quotation from P-9 and the identification of Keppra from P-23 are supported by the transcript. The statement that non-adherence is a ‘known precipitant’ is not stated in the conversation (unverifiable from transcript) and the answer implies a definitive causal link, whereas the transcript only shows the patient’s suspicion. This is a minor-to-moderate lack of grounding but not wholesale fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the asked connection between missed anti-epileptic medication and the seizure, and on evidence that the patient recognized the link. No major tangents."
