  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies both current medications (Avodart and Tums) and correctly links them to the conditions described in the transcript: Avodart for prostate enlargement/BPH and Tums for reflux. It also correctly states that the patient stopped his prior reflux medication because he identified dietary triggers/foods that helped. No contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It covers the key elements required by the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) Avodart for enlarged prostate, (2) Tums for reflux, and (3) stopping the prior reflux medication due to dietary modification. Minor omissions vs the Gold Answer include: specifying BPH/“not cancer,” that Tums is used PRN (“here and there”), and the Gold Answer’s note about no allergies (not asked in the question).",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims (current meds, indications, stopping prior reflux med and rationale) are directly supported by the transcript citations [P-26], [P-27]. The mention of a “knowledge graph provided” is not supported by the transcript and is an unnecessary framing detail, but it does not introduce incorrect clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on medications, their indications, and the patient-initiated change to reflux therapy with the reason—exactly what the question asks."
