  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies Avodart for prostate enlargement (consistent with Gold's enlarged prostate/BPH) and Tums for reflux (matches Gold's gastroesophageal reflux). The change (stopped previous reflux med due to figuring out foods) matches exactly. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., no 'dutasteride' or OTC details) but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: two current meds (Avodart for prostate issue, Tums for reflux), specific conditions, independent change to reflux regimen (stopped prior med), and reason (figured out foods). Missed details: full name 'dutasteride', explicit BPH, Tums as OTC/as-needed 'here and there', doctor's response 'Great', no allergies. Core question points fully covered (~90%).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Avodart [P-26] and Tums/reflux/change [P-27] are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, repeated references to a 'knowledge graph' (e.g., 'According to the knowledge graph') are not present in the provided transcript, introducing unverifiable/hallucinated elements, though facts remain grounded.",
    "relevance": "Answer is perfectly structured around the question: lists current meds with conditions, details the change and reason with citations. No off-topic content or tangents."
