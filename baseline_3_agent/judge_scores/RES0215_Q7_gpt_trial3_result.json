  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states the duration (4–5 days) and identifies wheeze/difficulty with deep breaths and exertional worsening, including the tag episode and colder weather. However, it makes major errors on two core asked elements: (1) it states wheezing “initially began without a reported acute trigger,” which contradicts the transcript where the initial onset is linked to running/playing tag with a cousin and becoming quite out of breath. (2) It states the transcript does not explicitly detail a nocturnal episode, but the parent clearly reports one night with wheeziness that resolved on its own and caused trouble falling asleep. It also over-interprets “progression in severity of dyspnea,” which is not established as worsening over time in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key gold points covered: 4–5 day onset; wheeze and difficulty taking deep breaths; exertional trigger mentioned (tag); cold weather as worsening factor; cough present. Key points missed or inadequately covered: the clear fluctuating/episodic pattern tied to activity → resolves with rest → recurs with activity; that cough emerged later (“and now”); non-productive nature of cough (no phlegm); the single nocturnal wheeze episode and the detail that it caused trouble falling asleep; pertinent negatives (no fever, no cyanosis, looks fine otherwise). Overall, it captures some timeline elements but omits several specific developments and misstates the nocturnal episode.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded or directly contradict the transcript: claiming no acute initial trigger, and claiming no explicit nocturnal event. The “progression in severity” assertion is also not supported. Other included details (past viral infections, seasonal allergies/Reactine) are in the transcript but are tangential to the question. Due to multiple contradictions/unverifiable inferences on central queried elements, faithfulness is low.",
    "relevance": "The response is partially focused on symptom development/patterns, but it introduces tangential history (prior infections, allergy medication, ‘knowledge graph’) and fails to directly describe the nocturnal episode as asked. It addresses the question only incompletely and with some off-target content."
