  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID) and the test (COVID swab) as specified in the Gold Answer and transcript [D-43]. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain details regarding the patient's recent social contacts. This is a significant factual error as the transcript explicitly mentions the patient meeting friends to walk dogs and one friend being sick [P-20].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers two of the three main components of the question (condition and test) but completely fails to provide the third component (the detail about social contacts), claiming the information is missing when it is present.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a 'hallucination of absence'. It claims the transcript lacks social contact details, which directly contradicts the source text where the patient discusses walking dogs with a sick friend [P-20, P-21].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant as it directly addresses all parts of the question, though the final part is answered incorrectly."
