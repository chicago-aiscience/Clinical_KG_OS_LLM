  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the dialogue in the transcript. It correctly identifies the doctor's plan to review the story with colleagues, the assessment of the cough duration and symptoms, and the lack of constitutional symptoms. It correctly identifies that the 'story' guides next steps. One minor detail: the Generated Answer refers to the doctor as 'she', which is not specified in the transcript, but this is a negligible discrepancy.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three parts of the question. It captures the main points of the Gold Answer but omits the clinical inference mentioned in the Gold Answer (lowered concern for TB/malignancy) and the contextual inference that the speaker was a medical student or trainee. It also omits the patient's specific comment about exercise at the end, though this was less central to the 'doctor's stated plan'.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, specifically referencing D-47. It does not hallucinate medical tests or diagnoses not mentioned in the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and structured to directly address each part of the user's multi-part question without unnecessary filler."
