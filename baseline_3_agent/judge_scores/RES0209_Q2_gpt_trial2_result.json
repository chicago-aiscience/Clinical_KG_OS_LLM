  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: (1) only asthma med is a bronchodilator/rescue inhaler, (2) administered as a “puffer” (inhaler), (3) clinician asked about a daily controller/maintenance med taken “every day no matter what,” which patient does not have. Generated answer is only correct on item (1): it identifies bronchodilator use. It is incorrect in stating the route is not specified (transcript explicitly says it’s a “puffer” at D-7/P-7) and incorrect in stating the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication (D-5, P-5 clearly covers this).",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: \n- Bronchodilator is the only asthma med (covered).\n- Used PRN/as-needed (not clearly stated as PRN in the generated answer, though implied).\n- Administered via puffer/inhaler (missed/contradicted).\n- Doctor asked about a daily controller/maintenance med taken every day; patient does not have it (missed/contradicted).\n- Patient denies any other meds (missed).\nOverall, it captures only a small portion of required elements (primarily medication name), missing most of the administration/controller/“no other meds” details.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains multiple statements that conflict with the transcript: it claims administration method is not specified, but D-7/P-7 specify a puffer; it claims no evidence the doctor asked about controller medication, but D-5/P-5 explicitly show that. These are not merely omissions; they are contradictions of available transcript evidence, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address the three parts of the question (current med, how administered, what controller med was asked about) and does not add major irrelevant content. However, it misidentifies/denies key asked-for information. Still, it remains focused on the question."

  "summary": "The answer is only partially correct (identifies bronchodilator) but contradicts the transcript on administration method and the clinician’s inquiry about daily controller medication, resulting in low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness despite being topically relevant."
