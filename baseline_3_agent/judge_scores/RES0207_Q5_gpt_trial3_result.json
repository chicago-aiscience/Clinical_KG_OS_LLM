  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main contributors highlighted in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose) and (2) hereditary predisposition (maternal history of epilepsy). It accurately cites the patient’s statements about taking Keppra [P-23], forgetting medication and linking it to the seizure [P-9], and family history (“My mom had it”) [P-26].\n\nHowever, it adds a partially inaccurate/overstated interpretation: that the “recent seizure episode definitively establishes the medical history of epilepsy.” In the transcript, the patient already reports a pre-existing diagnosis (“I do have a seizure disorder…I have epilepsy”) [P-8]. The seizure is consistent with epilepsy but does not “definitively establish” the diagnosis within this encounter; it is simply another event in someone with known epilepsy. This is a minor conceptual error rather than a core factual contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered:\n- Hereditary risk: epilepsy runs in family; mother affected [P-26].\n- Medication-related risk: missed Keppra dose [P-23], patient thinks it triggered seizure [P-9].\n- Connects family history to underlying epilepsy diagnosis (genetic predisposition).\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed or under-emphasized:\n- The reason for missing the dose (daughter’s birthday/routine disruption) [P-24].\n- The note that seizures are usually infrequent, suggesting better control with adherence [P-9].\n\nOverall, it captures the main risk factors but omits some contextual details included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations (Keppra use [P-23], missed dose and suspected trigger [P-9], maternal epilepsy history [P-26], patient’s stated epilepsy diagnosis [P-8]).\n\nThe main ungrounded/over-interpreted element is the assertion that the seizure “definitively establishes” the diagnosis; the transcript supports that the patient has epilepsy and had a seizure, but does not support a diagnostic conclusion being established in this visit. This is a minor departure from strict transcript-grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers the question by identifying hereditary and medication-related risk factors and explicitly explaining how the family history relates to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis. No major irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key hereditary (maternal epilepsy) and medication-related (missed Keppra dose) risk factors and links family history to predisposition, but it omits some contextual details (birthday disruption, baseline infrequency) and slightly overstates the seizure as definitively establishing the diagnosis."
