  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the medication as Keppra and uses the correct patient quote to establish the causal link.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several significant details present in the Gold Answer: it does not mention that the disclosure was spontaneous (unprompted by questions about adherence), it omits the specific context of the daughter's birthday/disrupted dinner routine as the reason for the missed dose, and it ignores the patient's remark that they rarely have seizures, which strengthens the causal link.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript and the Gold Answer without any hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the prompt regarding the connection between the missed dose and the seizure, as well as the evidence of the patient's recognition of that link."
