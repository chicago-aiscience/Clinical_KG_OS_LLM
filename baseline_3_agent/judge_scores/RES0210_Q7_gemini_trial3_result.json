  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies Sunday as the 'Initial Onset'. According to the transcript and Gold Answer, the illness began approximately a week prior with a runny nose [P-16] and included a raspy cough on Friday [P-3]. By starting the timeline on Sunday, the answer misrepresents the duration and early symptoms of the patient's condition. It also places the chest pain on Wednesday, whereas the patient noted it 'over the last day' [P-20], implying a Tuesday onset.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key elements from the Gold Answer: the runny nose (~1 week ago), the raspy cough (Friday), the yellow color of the sputum ('yellow custard'), and the exertional dyspnea (feeling winded on stairs). It fails to provide a 'complete' timeline as requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is generally grounded in the transcript, but it selectively ignores specific chronological details provided by the patient in [P-3] and [P-16]. The claim that chest pain was 'likely as a result of severe coughing' is an inference; the patient says it gets worse with coughing but does not explicitly state the cause.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly attempting to trace the timeline and clinical progression as requested, even though it fails to include all the data points."
