  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer. It correctly identifies COVID as the condition to rule out, the swab as the diagnostic test with a 24-48 hour turnaround, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all parts of the specific question asked. However, compared to the gold answer, it omits several contextual details provided in the transcript such as the 14-day isolation period, the mention of contact tracing if positive, and the note on supportive management being the same for both conditions.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the source transcript, specifically turn [D-52]. There are no hallucinations or external information added.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific questions asked without adding unnecessary filler, though it lacks the supplemental details included in the gold answer."
