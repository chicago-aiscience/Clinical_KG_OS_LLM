  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three key symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough) matching the Gold Answer, accurately quotes the doctor's connection in D-39, and specifies the swab test with citation. Minor discrepancies include not mentioning the patient's initial concern about COVID in P-1, omission of the doctor's confirmation of absent symptoms (e.g., no fever P-10, no breathing issues P-11), and adding 'nasopharyngeal' which is inferred but not explicitly stated; however, core facts align without major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: three symptoms, doctor's explicit connection via D-39 quote, swab test ordered, self-isolation advice. Missed points: patient's initial worry in P-1, systematic confirmation of absent symptoms (fever P-10, breathing P-11, sore throat P-13, chest pain P-22, 'pretty well' D-16), and explanation of narrow symptom profile supporting the diagnosis and testing decision. Covers approximately 60-70% of Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims (symptoms from P-1/P-4/P-7, doctor's statement and swab/self-isolation from D-39) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. Minor issues: references non-existent 'knowledge graph provided' (hallucination as none is in input) and specifies 'nasopharyngeal swab' (plausible for COVID context but transcript only says 'swab'). Mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists the symptom combination, explains the doctor's connection with quote and citation, and details the test method (swab) and rationale, perfectly addressing the question without off-topic content."
