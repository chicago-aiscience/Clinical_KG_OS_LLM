  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the details provided in the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the physical exam components, the COVID swab, the consultation with the attending, and the criteria for admission.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses the preliminary clinical impression (COPD exacerbation due to infection) which the gold answer included as part of the doctor's comprehensive statement. It also groups 'labs' only under decision criteria rather than listing them as an intended diagnostic test alongside the COVID swab.",
    "faithfulness": "All points in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript segment [D-43]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address the components requested in the prompt (examinations, tests, consultations, and criteria)."
