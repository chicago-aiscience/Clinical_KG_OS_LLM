  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies Sunday as the 'Initial Onset' of the illness. According to transcript [P-3], a raspy cough was present on Friday, and a runny nose was present approximately a week prior [P-16]. Additionally, it places the onset of chest pain on Wednesday, whereas the patient stated they noticed it 'over the last day' [P-20], which corresponds to Tuesday. It correctly identifies the onset of the fever (Monday) and the chills (Tuesday/Wednesday).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the runny nose (1 week prior), the Friday raspy cough (the actual initial symptom), the specific 'yellow custard' description of the sputum, and the exertional dyspnea (getting winded on stairs). It addresses most of the requested symptoms but fails to provide the correct onset for two of them (raspy cough and chest pain).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, using specific citations. However, it hallucinates the 'Initial Onset' as Sunday by overlooking the patient's clarification in [P-3]. The claim that chest pain started on Wednesday is a misinterpretation of the phrase 'noticed over the last day'.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant as it directly attempts to structure the timeline and progression as requested by the prompt, despite the factual inaccuracies regarding the specific dates."
