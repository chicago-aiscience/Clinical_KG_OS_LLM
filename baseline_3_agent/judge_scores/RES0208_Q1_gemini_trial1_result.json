{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies several symptoms (weakness, achiness, loss of taste, fever, loss of appetite) but makes a significant error regarding 'sore throat' and 'cough'. It claims the patient 'explicitly stated' these in [P-1], but [P-1] only mentions shortness of breath and fatigue. These symptoms aren't discussed until later turns [P-7, P-8, P-9].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: the diminished sense of smell [P-6], the specific mention of headaches [P-11, P-12, P-13], and the explicit denial of runny nose/congestion [P-10]. It covers about 60% of the relevant symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The citation [P-1] for sore throat and cough is a hallucination; the patient does not mention those symptoms in that turn. While the symptoms are mentioned later in the transcript, the generated answer misrepresents the dialogue's flow and content at that specific point. Other sections are well-grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested categorization (Upper Respiratory, Musculoskeletal, Sensory, Constitutional) perfectly."
