  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the three triggers (exercise during gym/recess, cold air/winter, spring/pollen) and links them to worsening asthma symptoms, consistent with P-9 and P-11. It also correctly notes increased symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheeze) and increased bronchodilator reliance (P-1, P-15), and correctly cites sister with asthma (P-32). However, it introduces non-transcript elements (“knowledge graph,” and that triggers are ‘specifically linked’ to diagnoses within it) and adds interpretive claims (e.g., ‘confirms an acute worsening’) that are reasonable but not explicitly stated in the transcript. No major contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core relationship: triggers (exercise/cold/pollen) contributing to exacerbation and pollen prompting suspicion of allergies; includes family history (sister with asthma) as supporting context. Missing several Gold Answer details: (1) explicit change in rescue inhaler use from ~once every two weeks to 5–6 times/week (P-8); (2) that patient suspected allergies but was never formally diagnosed (P-12) and clinician response (“that would make sense,” D-13); (3) clinician revisited allergies later (D-31/P-31); (4) the point that rescue-only regimen/no daily controller and suggested medication change for better control (P-5/D-43); (5) patient reported no other triggers (D-10/P-10). Overall ~50–79% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Some content is grounded with appropriate citations (P-1, P-9, P-11, P-15, P-32). But repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and claims about how it classifies pollen/allergen and links triggers to diagnoses are not in the transcript. Also, labeling family history as a ‘significant risk factor’ is plausible general medical knowledge but not stated. These reduce grounding, though the main clinical narrative remains consistent with the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers how the listed triggers and sister’s asthma relate to the current exacerbation and why pollen raises suspicion of undiagnosed allergies. Minimal extraneous content aside from the unnecessary ‘knowledge graph’ framing."
