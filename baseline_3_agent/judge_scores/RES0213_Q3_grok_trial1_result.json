  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as anxiety-induced or functional chest pain due to stress, aligning closely with the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' Core supporting facts like academic stress [P-13, P-15], anxiety history [P-21], somatic symptoms during nervousness [P-19], and patient attribution [P-8] match the Gold Answer without contradictions. However, it uses 'Functional Chest Pain' which is slightly broader/less specific than Gold's phrasing, and omits key details like the situational pattern and pertinent negatives, representing minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: 1) Situational pattern (alone vs. distracted) [P-4,P-9,P-29]; 2) Anxiety history [P-21,P-22]; 3) Thesis stress [P-13,P-15,P-16]; 4) Nervousness-induced breathing changes [P-19]; 5) Patient considers stress [P-8]; 6) Pertinent negatives (no fevers [P-12], no exertional [P-10], rest pain [P-11], no palps [P-20], no asthma [P-23,P-24]). Generated covers stress (partial, misses P-16), anxiety history (partial, misses P-22), breathing/nervousness [P-19], patient attribution [P-8], and pain description; misses situational pattern entirely and all pertinent negatives, covering approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: academic stress [P-13,P-15], anxiety history [P-21], pain characteristics [P-3,P-6], breathing changes tied to nervousness [P-19], patient suspicion of stress [P-8]. Citations are accurate. No fabricated details; the diagnosis term 'Functional Chest Pain' is a plausible clinical interpretation grounded in the anxiety/stress context described.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly states the diagnosis and lists specific transcript-supported observations in bullet points, perfectly addressing the question about diagnosis and supporting clinical findings without any off-topic content."
