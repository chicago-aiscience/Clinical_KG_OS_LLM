  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all factual elements of the Gold Answer: COVID-19 swab with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and all listed supportive care items (hydration, nutrition, rest, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/anseads for aches). It correctly notes symptom overlap from transcript. Minor difference: keeps transcript's 'anseads' (vs Gold's 'NSAIDs' interpretation), but no contradiction. Omits alternative viral illness diagnosis and explicit 'no prescriptions' note, but these are not errors in stated facts. Fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: diagnostic swab/24-48h (covered), 14-day isolation (covered), contact tracing if positive (covered), alternative viral illness if negative (missed), supportive care details all covered (hydration, food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches), no prescriptions beyond supportive (implied but not explicit). Covers ~90% (misses alternative diagnosis explicitly).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] of transcript: swab, results timeline, isolation duration, contact tracing condition, exact supportive recommendations including 'well hydrated,' 'nutritious food,' 'sleeping well,' 'antipyretics like Tylenol for fevers,' 'Tylenol or anseads.' Symptoms overlap stated in [D-52]. 'Knowledge graph' mention is extra but unverifiable/minor; no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, all supportive care); no off-topic content, directly mirrors query structure."
