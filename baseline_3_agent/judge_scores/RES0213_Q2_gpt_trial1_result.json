  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC products the patient tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer) and correctly states they were not very effective (\"hasn't really helped very much\"), matching [P-6]. However, it incorrectly states there is no indication the patient takes any routine OTC supplements; the patient explicitly reports taking a multivitamin as their only routine supplement/medication [P-25]. This is a material factual error relative to the question and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer tried for chest pain; (2) minimal/ineffective relief. Key points missed: (1) routine daily multivitamin [P-25]; (2) the clarification that they take no other medications besides the multivitamin (i.e., no prescription meds) [D-25, P-25]. Gold also mentions stress management and smoking reduction, but those are not OTC meds/supplements and are less central to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The chest-pain OTC meds and their lack of benefit are directly supported by the transcript [P-6]. The statement that there is no indication of routine supplements is not supported and contradicts [P-25] (multivitamin). The mention of a \"knowledge graph\" is extraneous and not grounded in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on OTC medications for chest pain, their effectiveness, and routine supplements (the asked domains). The only issue is the incorrect omission/denial of the multivitamin, but the content remains on-topic."
