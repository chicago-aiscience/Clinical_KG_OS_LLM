  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that loss of smell, loss of taste, and mild dry cough began about two days before the visit and that the cough started at the same time as the sensory changes (supported by P-1/P-2 and D-6/P-6). It is also correct that the cough did not worsen and remained consistent (D-8/P-8). However, it incorrectly states there is “no mention” of prior similar symptoms; the patient explicitly denied any prior episodes (“No, no, nothing like this” at D-3/P-3). This is a key factual error because the question explicitly asks about prior similar symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer include: (1) simultaneous onset ~2 days prior (covered); (2) sensory symptoms consistent/no fluctuation (missing); (3) cough consistent/no worsening (covered); (4) none intermittent/variable (partially implied but not clearly stated for sensory symptoms); (5) partial nature of anosmia/ageusia (missing); (6) explicit denial of prior similar symptoms (missed/incorrect). Overall coverage is partial, with notable omissions about smell/taste course and the partial deficits, and an incorrect handling of prior history.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations for timing and cough consistency. The statement that there is “no mention” of prior similar symptoms is not faithful to the transcript and directly conflicts with D-3/P-3, where the patient clearly denies prior similar symptoms. The answer also omits transcript-supported details (partial smell/taste loss), but omission alone is not hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer remains focused on the asked symptom timeline: relative onset, progression/fluctuation, and prior history. It does not add major irrelevant material."
