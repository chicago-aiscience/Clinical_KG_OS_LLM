  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer has two minor factual errors. First, it attributes the observation that the condition 'feels different' to the doctor, whereas the transcript shows the patient made this observation (P-16). Second, it suggests the patient should 'continue' to have rescue puffers, but the transcript clarifies the patient currently does not have a supply of rescue medication (P-17, D-18), and the gold answer correctly notes they need to obtain them.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all four specific components requested in the prompt (assessment, physical exam, treatment, contingency). However, it misses the detail included in the gold answer regarding the doctor's immediate plan to consult with a supervising physician ('the doc') before finalizing the steps.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful but suffers from the attribution error mentioned in correctness (attributing the patient's description of symptoms to the doctor) and a slight hallucination regarding the patient's current possession of rescue medication ('continue to have' vs 'obtain').",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the prompt exactly, addressing each part of the question clearly."
