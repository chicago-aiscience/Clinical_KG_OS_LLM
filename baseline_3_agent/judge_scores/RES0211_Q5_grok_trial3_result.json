  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately integrates family history (father's allergies [P-33], cousin's asthma [P-30]), notes allergies not yet seasonal [P-16,P-17], brother's cold as viral source [P-39,D-58], and isolated farm/homeschool life [P-41-P-44,P-48] pointing to intra-household transmission. Generated Answer partially covers brother's cold and own allergies but ignores father's allergies, cousin's asthma, and farm/homeschool isolation; falsely claims transcript lacks these details (hallucination); adds unconfirmed 'common cold' diagnosis not in Gold or transcript; contradicts by underemphasizing collective relation to symptoms. Significant errors warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: father allergies, cousin asthma, allergies not started, brother cold ~2wks, farm life, homeschool/COVID isolation, mom/dad home/farm work, minimal leaving house, only dog. Generated covers brother's cold partially and own allergies; misses father/cousin specifics, farm/homeschool/COVID isolation emphasizing transmission source. Covers ~25-30% of points. Score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absence of transcript info on father allergies [P-33 present], cousin asthma [P-30 present], farm [P-43-44 present], homeschool [P-41 present], COVID context [P-41-42 present]; cites [D-58] inaccurately for diagnosis/exposures; infers 'common cold' diagnosis not stated; claims no current Claritin use via [D-58] (partially verifiable but overstated). Multiple hallucinations/misreads. Score 2.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for collective relation of specified factors (family history, brother cold, farm/homeschool/COVID) to symptoms. Generated addresses symptoms/brother/allergies somewhat but denies key factors exist in transcript, adds off-topic diagnosis/exposure analysis without isolation context; partially on-topic but derailed. Score 3."
