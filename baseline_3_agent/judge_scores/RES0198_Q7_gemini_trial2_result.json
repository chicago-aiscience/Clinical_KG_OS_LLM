  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the onset (one week ago) and the sequence of symptoms (stuffy nose first, then runny nose). However, it incorrectly concludes that the symptoms were intermittent 'rather than constant'. While the patient initially said 'on and off' [P-1], they later explicitly clarified that the symptoms had been 'pretty constant for the past week' [P-8] when asked directly. By ignoring this clarification, the generated answer provides a factually misleading description of the symptom pattern compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the basic chronology (onset, first symptom, and shift). However, it misses several key nuances provided in the Gold Answer: 1) the patient's clarification that symptoms were actually constant, 2) the potential influence of over-the-counter decongestants on the symptom shift, and 3) the fact that symptoms were not getting better, which prompted the visit.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the specific sections of the transcript it cites (P-1 and P-3). It does not hallucinate outside information, though it selectively omits the contradictory information found in P-8.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the onset, the first symptom, the shift in predominance, and the frequency (constant vs. intermittent)."
