  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: productive cough with whitish clear mucus for first 4-5 days resolved (matches [P-6]); persistent cough for 2 weeks ([P-2]); transition to dry cough ([P-5, P-6]); chest pain/soreness when coughing too much, not independent ([P-15]). No errors or contradictions, even in phrasing 'chest pain' which aligns with patient's 'hurts a little bit' and 'sore'. Score: 5.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: persistent cough lasting 2 weeks; productive cough/mucus first 4-5 days resolved; dry cough persisting since ~day 5; chest soreness/pain with excessive coughing. Missed: sore throat first 2-3 days; runny nose first couple days; collective 'flu symptoms' resolved in 3-4 days except cough; cough frequency (3-4x/hour); spontaneous/no triggers; stable intensity and frequency; pertinent negatives (no dyspnea, fever, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain). Covers core cough evolution and chest soreness (~50% of key points). Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations ([P-6], [P-2], [P-15]); productive mucus details match [P-6]; dry cough [P-5/P-6]; persistence [P-2]; chest pain timing [P-15]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by categorizing symptoms into 'Resolved' and 'Still Present' sections, focusing solely on patient-reported symptoms from the two-week illness without tangents. Score: 5."
