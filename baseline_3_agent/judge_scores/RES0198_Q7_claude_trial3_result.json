  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding symptom pattern. In [P-1], the patient initially describes symptoms as 'on and off,' but when directly asked in [D-8] if symptoms are constant or come and go, the patient clarifies they have been 'pretty constant for the past week' [P-8]. The Generated Answer incorrectly presents the symptoms as intermittent throughout, contradicting this clarification. The chronological progression and symptom shift (stuffy first, then runny) are correctly identified.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main chronological elements: onset timing (one week), initial symptom (stuffy nose), and symptom progression (to runny nose). However, it omits several key details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the potential influence of decongestants on symptom transition [P-10], (2) the explicit clarification that symptoms were 'pretty constant' despite initial 'on and off' description [P-8], (3) the lack of improvement prompting the visit, and (4) the nuanced explanation of the apparent contradiction between initial description and later clarification. Coverage is approximately 60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript but contains a critical unfaithful representation. While [P-1] does mention 'on and off,' the answer fails to acknowledge the subsequent clarification in [P-8] that symptoms were 'pretty constant.' By presenting only the initial 'on and off' description without the correction, the answer creates a misleading impression not fully supported by the complete transcript evidence. The other facts about symptom progression are accurately cited.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: (1) which symptom appeared first (stuffy nose), (2) how the predominant symptom changed (shifted to runny nose), and (3) whether symptoms were constant or intermittent (incorrectly states intermittent). Despite the factual error on the third component, the answer remains focused on the exact elements requested without tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the chronological sequence of nasal symptoms (stuffy nose first, then runny nose) but contains a significant error in characterizing symptom pattern. It presents symptoms as intermittent based on the initial statement in [P-1] while omitting the critical clarification in [P-8] that symptoms were 'pretty constant for the past week.' This represents both a correctness issue (contradicting the patient's clarification) and a completeness issue (missing key contextual details including decongestant use and the nuanced explanation of the apparent contradiction). While the answer is relevant and mostly grounded in the transcript, the misrepresentation of a directly answered question component significantly impacts its overall quality."
