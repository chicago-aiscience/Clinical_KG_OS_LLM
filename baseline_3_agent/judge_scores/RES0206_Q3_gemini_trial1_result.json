  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly categorizes green-yellow sputum as a symptom used to distinguish COPD exacerbation from infection, whereas the Gold Answer (and standard clinical logic) identifies purulent sputum as a sign of an infectious trigger. It also includes hemoptysis, which is in the transcript but not part of the Gold Answer's diagnostic reasoning for the dual assessment.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, including increased cough frequency, increased sputum volume, decreased exercise tolerance (walking the dog), sinus pressure, headache, and exposure to a sick contact. It also omits the exclusion of environmental triggers and medication non-adherence.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer repeatedly hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information and diagnostic links, which does not exist in the provided transcript or prompt. This is a significant breach of faithfulness to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant as it attempts to answer both parts of the specific question regarding symptoms and the distinction between diagnoses."
