  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key elements of the management plan as described in the Gold Answer, including diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), physical examination of the chest, self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate), timeline (24-48 hours), public health nurse follow-up, and disposition criteria based on test results. Minor discrepancies include incorrect citations (e.g., chest X-ray and physical exam attributed to [D-36] instead of [D-37]) and categorizing physical exam as a diagnostic test, but core facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam planned (chest due to breathing difficulty), diagnostic tests (CXR to check for chest infection, COVID swab), self-isolation (away from everyone incl. wife, self-isolate as much as possible), timeline (24-48 hours), public health nurse if positive, disposition based on results (no specific thresholds). All key points covered (100%), though exact phrasing/reasons slightly less detailed and [D-38] transition not mentioned.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript, primarily [D-37]: tests, exam, self-isolation, timeline, criteria, and PHN role. No hallucinations or fabricated content. Minor issue: citations inaccurate ([D-36] used for elements only in [D-37]), but content precisely grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured as bullet points directly addressing each element of the question (tests, phys exam, self-isolation incl. from whom, timeline, criteria), with no off-topic content or tangents; perfectly focused on the doctor's management plan."
