  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the reported nasal symptoms (stuffy nose and runny nose, with progression from stuffy to mostly running, citing P-1 and P-3 accurately, matching Gold). However, it incorrectly states that the character of the nasal discharge is not specified, contradicting P-5 ('mostly clear') and Gold Answer. It also erroneously claims that denials of related symptoms (cough [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat etc. [P-7], loss of taste/smell [P-16]) are not explicit due to missing context, despite full transcript availability, representing significant factual errors and contradictions on key elements.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: stuffy/runny nose for 1 week, progression (stuffy first, now running). Missed: clear discharge, mild fatigue, explicit denials of cough, post-nasal drip, sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills, loss of taste/smell, and other pertinent negatives. Covers ~30% of key points (mainly nasal reports).",
    "faithfulness": "Nasal symptom claims verifiable in P-1, P-2, P-3; D-39 summary accurate. However, assertion that discharge character not specified hallucinates absence (contradicts P-5); claim of missing context for denials fabricates lack of evidence (full transcript has explicit queries/denials in P-4, P-6, P-7, P-16). Multiple hallucinated absences.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the question's three parts (reported symptoms, discharge character, denied symptoms), with no off-topic content beyond minor doctor summary; perfectly focused."
