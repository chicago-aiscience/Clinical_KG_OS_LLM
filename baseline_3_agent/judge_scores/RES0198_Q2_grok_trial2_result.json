  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the patient tried decongestants [P-10], matching the Gold Answer. The assessment of effectiveness as 'working a little bit' with the implication of relieving stuffiness due to the nose becoming runny is fully consistent with the patient's quote and Gold's description of ambiguity and reasoning. The doctor's recommendation of Tylenol Cold [D-39] is correct, though Gold includes additional context like hydration, but no factual errors present.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) tried OTC decongestants [P-10] - covered; (2) assessment ambiguous/'little bit'/reasoning on runny nose [P-10] - covered with similar detail; (3) recommended hydrated + OTC like Tylenol Cold + viral context [D-39] - partially covered (Tylenol Cold yes, but misses hydration and full supportive care/weeks expectation). Covers core question elements (~80-90%), minor misses on fuller recommendation details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: decongestants and quote 'worked a little bit' from [P-10]; runny nose implying relief from patient's words; Tylenol Cold from [D-39]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question (medication tried, effectiveness assessment, doctor's OTC rec) with no off-topic content."
