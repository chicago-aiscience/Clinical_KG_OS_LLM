  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies 'Covid' as the alternative diagnosis (matching Gold's 'COVID-19'), the 'covid swab' test, and '24 to 48 hours' turnaround time, with correct citations to [D-52]; minor capitalization differences (Covid vs COVID-19) are negligible, and all facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: alternative diagnosis (COVID-19/Covid), specific test (COVID swab/covid swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours); citations match; Gold's additional symptom details are elaborative but not core requirements of the question, so 100% coverage of essentials.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] of transcript ('symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid', 'covid swab', 'hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours'); accurate citations, no unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is perfectly structured and focused on the three-part question (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time), using bullet points for clarity with no off-topic content."
