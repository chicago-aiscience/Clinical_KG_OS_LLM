  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains all core facts from the Gold Answer with minor formatting differences. It correctly identifies the physical exam, tick laboratory identification, blood work for Lyme serology, prophylactic antibiotics, physician consultation, and preventive garden advice. The reference to D-5 for tick identification is appropriate as it discusses the deer tick. The factual content aligns with the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components: diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick lab identification, blood work), treatment (prophylactic antibiotics), physician consultation, and preventive advice (garden inspection, insecticide). It includes the rationale for antibiotics (>72 hours attachment) and specific details about tick habitat. The answer is slightly more structured with bullet points but captures 95%+ of the Gold Answer's key information. Missing minor details include the plastic container mention, specific geographic risk from Strathroy, and the exact phrasing about 'safer than not' for medication initiation.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with appropriate citation tags. The physical exam is mentioned in D-18, tick laboratory identification in D-6 and D-18, blood work in D-18, antibiotics discussion in D-6 and D-18, physician consultation in D-13 and D-22, and garden advice in D-18. No hallucinated information is present. The reference to D-5 for deer tick discussion is accurate. All citations can be traced to specific statements in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the question: diagnostic tests (laboratory and physical), treatments, physician consultation, and preventive advice about garden/outdoor environment. The structure follows the question's organization logically. No irrelevant information is included. The answer stays focused on the clinical plan without digressing into the patient's history or symptoms beyond what's necessary to explain the plan."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-structured, and comprehensive summary of the clinical plan. It correctly identifies all major diagnostic tests, treatment recommendations, consultation plans, and preventive advice with appropriate transcript citations. The answer is highly faithful to the source material with no hallucinations. Minor completeness deductions are due to missing some contextual details (plastic container, Strathroy geographic risk, exact medication phrasing) present in the Gold Answer, but all essential clinical components are covered. The response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses all aspects of the question."
