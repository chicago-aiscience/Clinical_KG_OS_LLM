  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it claims that specific questions about fever, runny nose, and sick contacts were not present in the transcript. However, these are explicitly found in [D-7], [D-8], and [D-10]. It also fails to identify that these questions were used to exclude conditions like pneumonia, bronchitis, and URTI, as stated in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It does not explain how fever screens for pneumonia, how runny nose screens for URTI, how travel screens for exposure-related infections, or how rashes screen for systemic conditions. It focuses on identifying a likely diagnosis rather than explaining the screening/exclusion process requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript is missing segments. It also misidentifies [D-14] and [D-20] as being related to fever/runny nose, whereas they are about pain and growth parameters respectively.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it attempts to address the 'narrowing the differential' part of the question, it fails to address the first part of the question regarding what specific conditions the listed symptoms (fever, travel, etc.) were meant to screen for or exclude."
