  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer highlights three core elements: COVID swab (D-29), explicit medication change suggestion ('little change to your medications', D-43), and consultation (D-29, D-43). Generated correctly identifies COVID swab. Consultation is noted but only from D-29, missing fuller D-43 context of presenting case and returning. Critically, Generated states 'transcript does not explicitly state a directive to change the medication', contradicting Gold's emphasis on D-43 suggestion; it implies review instead. Adds 'asthma exacerbation [D-29]' not stated in transcript. Significant factual discrepancies on key medication point specified in question.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) COVID swab despite negative screens (100% covered); 2) Medication change suggestion (D-43), patient context of only rescue inhaler, sports goal (poorly covered; denies explicitness, no D-43 or sports); 3) Consultation as trainee presenting case, return shortly (D-29/D-43; only partial D-29 coverage). Covers swab fully, ~50% on meds/consult. Overall 50-79% key points.",
    "faithfulness": "COVID swab verifiable [D-29]. Consultation [D-29] accurate. Medication review inferred plausibly from symptoms/consult, but claim of no 'explicit directive' overlooks D-43 suggestion (verifiable). 'Asthma exacerbation [D-29]' hallucinated—not in transcript (clinician takes history, no diagnosis). Citations [D-29], [P-1], [P-15] accurate. Minor unverifiable details/hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer around three steps matching question's specified elements (diagnostic test, medication regimen change suggestion, consultation next steps). No tangents; focused on plan from transcript."
