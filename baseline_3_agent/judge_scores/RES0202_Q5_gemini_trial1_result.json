  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the child returned from school before getting sick and that no sick contacts or school notifications were reported. However, it contains a minor error regarding the timeline, stating the cough developed on Thursday, while the transcript says it started Wednesday night. It also misses the mother's explicit suspicion of COVID mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the school's requirement for a COVID test to return/inform others, the mother's explicit statement that she was 'sure' there were no contacts outside of school while being unsure about school, and the doctor's process of ruling out travel and environmental factors to narrow the source to the school.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer has significant issues with citations. It attributes the information about sick contacts and school notification to [P-1], but these facts are actually located in [P-38] and [P-39]. The transcript at [P-1] is the initial intake and does not contain the specific negative reportings mentioned in the later segments.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is very relevant, directly addressing each part of the user's question regarding school attendance, sick contacts, and school notifications."
