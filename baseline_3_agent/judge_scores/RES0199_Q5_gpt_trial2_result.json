  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the transcript. In the transcript, the doctor *did* explore: living situation (asked where the patient lives, lives alone in an apartment) [D-45/P-45]; home/environmental exposures (old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets) [D-46/P-46]; contact with sick individuals [D-47/P-47]; workplace and workplace illness (where they work; whether anyone at work has been sick) [D-48/D-50, P-50]; and recent travel [D-49/P-49]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states these were “not explored.”",
    "completeness": "Key points expected per Gold Answer: living situation (apartment, alone), environmental exposures (carpets/dust/mold/asbestos/pets), sick contacts (mostly home; possible lunchroom exposure), workplace (car dealership; no known sick coworkers), travel (none), and (optionally) substance use screening. The Generated Answer omits nearly all of these and instead claims they were not explored, only mentioning public health contact tracing. Coverage is therefore far below 20% of the required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not just unverifiable but contradicted by the transcript (e.g., “Living Situation: Not explored,” “Workplace Environment: Not explored,” “Travel History: Not explored”). The only grounded element is the mention of contact tracing if COVID-positive [D-52], but using that to imply the doctor didn’t ask about exposures is inconsistent with the documented questioning. Overall, the answer is largely unfaithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured around the exact exposure categories asked (living, workplace, travel, sick contacts), with only minor extra commentary about COVID-19. While the content is wrong, it remains on-topic for the question."
