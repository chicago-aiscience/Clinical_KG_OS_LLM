  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer accurately states multivitamins only [P-40], pre-diabetic with glucose monitoring but no prescription meds [P-33], no HTN [P-34]/cholesterol [P-35], penicillin allergy [P-37], rash reaction [P-38], no breathing trouble [P-39]. Generated correctly notes multivitamins [P-40] and penicillin [P-37] but claims transcript does not specify reaction (false, [P-38] explicitly states 'rash'), invents 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' nonexistent in transcript, and wrongly says pre-diabetes managed with multivitamins (not supported). Significant errors on reaction and extra fabrications contradict Gold's facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: multivitamins only; pre-diabetic monitoring no Rx meds; no HTN/cholesterol; penicillin allergy; rash no breathing trouble. Generated covers multivitamins and allergy (~50%), mentions pre-diabetes but inaccurately; completely misses reaction (rash, no dyspnea) and denials of other conditions. Covers 50-79% partially.",
    "faithfulness": "[P-40] verifiable for multivitamins; [P-37] for allergy. But 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' hallucinated (no KG in transcript); claims reaction 'not specified' false ([P-38] 'I get a rash'); pre-diabetes 'managed with multivitamins' not in transcript (separate mentions). Multiple hallucinations and unverifiable/misstated claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses all three question elements with structured sections (Medication Regimen, Drug Allergy, Specific Adverse Reaction), no off-topic content, perfectly focused despite errors."
