  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately states the test was negative. It correctly cites the patient's hospital employment and persistent cough. However, it misses some key details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific timeline (test done approximately two weeks ago at symptom onset), the patient staying home awaiting symptom resolution, and the specific mention of occupational exposure providing a rationale for testing. The core facts are correct but some contextual details are incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main components: diagnosis (COVID-19), evidence prompting investigation (hospital work, persistent cough, flu-like symptoms, coworker concerns), and test results (negative). However, it omits several key points from the Gold Answer: the voluntary nature of disclosure, specific PPE use details, the exact timing of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset), and the patient's decision to stay home post-test awaiting symptom resolution before returning to work. Covers approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations are accurate ([P-2], [P-15], [P-14], [P-17], [P-35]). The answer correctly quotes and references specific patient statements. There is no hallucination or fabrication - all information can be traced back to the source material. The inference about COVID-19 being the 'primary diagnosis investigated' is reasonable given the context, though slightly interpretive.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: what diagnosis was investigated (COVID-19), what evidence prompted it (persistent cough, hospital work, flu-like symptoms, coworker concerns), and what testing revealed (negative result). The structure mirrors the question format and stays focused on the relevant information without tangential content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates strong correctness and faithfulness with accurate facts and proper citations from the transcript. It identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis, provides relevant evidence (hospital employment, persistent symptoms, coworker concerns), and states the negative test result. However, it lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including specific timeline information (test done at symptom onset two weeks ago), the patient's subsequent home isolation, and certain nuances about PPE use and occupational exposure rationale. The answer is highly relevant and contains no fabrications, but completeness is reduced due to missing 30% of key points."
