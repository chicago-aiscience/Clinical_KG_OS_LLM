  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the main diagnostic conclusion (viral infection/common cold) and identifies several key supporting features mentioned in the Gold Answer. However, it omits critical details such as the clear discharge quality, absence of fever/systemic symptoms, absence of lower respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath), lack of colored discharge, absence of sore throat, and the systematic ruling out of allergic and bacterial causes. The Generated Answer mentions symptom progression and duration but lacks the depth of evidence presented in the Gold Answer regarding what was absent (negative findings) that helped exclude other diagnoses.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It addresses symptom type (nasal congestion/rhinorrhea), duration (one week), symptom progression (stuffy to runny), and the doctor's conclusion. However, it fails to mention: (1) clear discharge quality as evidence against bacterial infection, (2) absence of fever/chills/headache ruling out bacterial cause, (3) absence of cough/sore throat/shortness of breath, (4) no exposure to allergens/animals/dust ruling out allergic cause, (5) no known allergies, (6) no prior recent episodes, and (7) nephew's daycare attendance as potential viral exposure source.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, there is one minor inaccuracy: the patient said symptoms were 'on and off' only in P-1, but later clarified they were 'pretty constant for the past week' in P-8. The Generated Answer cites P-1 for 'on and off' without noting this clarification. The reference to Knowledge Graph is unexplained and potentially fabricated as no such external knowledge source was provided in the materials. All other claims are verifiable in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about evidence supporting viral infection diagnosis and attempts to distinguish it from allergic or bacterial causes. However, it provides limited comparative analysis between viral vs. allergic vs. bacterial etiologies as specifically requested in the question. The answer focuses primarily on positive findings supporting viral infection but gives minimal attention to the systematic exclusion of allergic and bacterial causes that the question explicitly asks about."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the viral infection diagnosis and provides some supporting evidence including symptom type, duration, and progression. However, it significantly lacks the comprehensive differential diagnostic reasoning present in the Gold Answer. Key omissions include: clear discharge quality, absence of fever and systemic symptoms, systematic exclusion of allergic triggers, and detailed evidence against bacterial infection. The answer contains one factual inconsistency regarding symptom constancy and an unexplained reference to a 'Knowledge Graph.' While relevant to the question, it only partially addresses the comparative diagnostic reasoning (viral vs. allergic vs. bacterial) that was specifically requested."
