  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the timing of the dry cough (4-5 days prior, [P-2]) and runny nose (couple of days, [P-11]), and notes persistence without improvement, aligning with Gold's description of stable severity. It correctly notes clear runny nose discharge ([P-12]). However, it omits explicit mention of the cough being dry/non-productive despite the question specifying 'dry cough,' does not detail that severity 'stayed the same' precisely ([P-7]), and misframes the prior experiences comparison by focusing on past fevers ([P-13]) and family asthma/no SOB ([P-28]) instead of the Gold's emphasis on novel dry cough and longer-lasting runny nose ([P-24]). Includes irrelevant planned interventions not in Gold. Core timing facts correct, but significant omissions and off-focus comparison represent some factual discrepancies vs. Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: cough onset 4-5 days as first symptom (covered), dry/non-productive (missed), severity stable/not improving (partially covered as 'persisted without improvement'), runny nose later (couple days, ~2-3 after cough; covered), clear discharge (covered), progressive pattern (implicitly covered), prior: never dry cough like this, past runny noses shorter, healthy otherwise (missed), no SOB/wheeze history (partially as family check). Covers timing/duration/partial severity (~60%), misses core prior symptom comparison details and dry nature.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: cough 4-5d [P-2], runny couple days/clear [P-11,P-12], past fevers/no current [P-13], asthma workup/no SOB [P-28], plans [D-37,D-39]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded despite including non-symptom content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom onset/timing/duration of cough vs. runny nose and partial comparison/severity; however, diverts to irrelevant fever history, family asthma details, and planned interventions, which do not pertain to symptom development over time or prior similar experiences."
