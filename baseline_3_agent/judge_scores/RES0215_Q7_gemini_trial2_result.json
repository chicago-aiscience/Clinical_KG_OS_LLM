  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it claims the transcript does not detail a nocturnal episode, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions one in [P-43] and [P-44]. Additionally, it states the wheezing began without an acute trigger, contradicting the Gold Answer and the transcript [P-3] which links the onset to playing tag. It also characterizes the dyspnea as progressing in severity, which is not supported by the 'fluctuating' nature described in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer: the specific detail that symptoms resolve with rest [P-6], the fact that the cough is non-productive (no phlegm) [P-31], and the details of the nocturnal episode (difficulty falling asleep). It covers the 4-5 day timeline and the general symptoms but fails on the specific requirements of the prompt regarding the nocturnal episode.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript lacks information about a nocturnal event. Since the transcript clearly states, 'there was one one one night when she had some issues... with wheeziness' [P-43], the Generated Answer's claim is a failure of faithfulness to the source text.",
    "relevance": "While the answer addresses the timeline and some triggers, it fails to address the specific part of the question regarding the nocturnal episode. By claiming the information is missing, it provides an irrelevant/incorrect response to that specific component of the multi-part question."
