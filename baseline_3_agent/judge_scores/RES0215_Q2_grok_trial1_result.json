  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states no medications for current episodes (resolve on own with rest [P-33,P-34]), occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies [P-35,P-36], no prescribed meds [P-36,P-46,P-47], past viral infections no antibiotics [P-16]. Generated correctly identifies Reactine OTC for allergies, no meds for current episode, no prescribed meds. Minor discrepancies: calls Reactine 'currently part of regimen' (Gold emphasizes occasional/not regular), assumes current symptoms are 'viral infection' (transcript only notes past virals [P-15], current undiagnosed), references non-existent 'knowledge graph'. Core facts match, so minor errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: no meds for current (resolves own), occasional OTC Reactine for allergies, no prescribed/regular meds, past infections no abx. Generated covers OTC Reactine for allergies, no meds for current episode, no prescribed. Misses explicit 'resolves on own with rest' and past no abx, but covers ~85% of core medication-related points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like Reactine for allergies grounded [P-35,P-36], no prescribed [P-36], no current meds mentioned grounded. Citations accurate. Hallucinations: 'knowledge graph' confirms Reactine OTC (no KG in transcript), current episode as 'viral infection' (only past [P-15]), 'regimen' implies regularity (transcript: 'sometimes/occasional'). Some unverifiable/plausible additions (Reactine OTC common knowledge, viral plausible), but multiple extras.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists medications (Reactine OTC for allergies), notes none for current respiratory, confirms no prescribed management. Minor tangents (viral assumption) still tied to symptoms; perfectly addresses question."
