  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the key doctor-recommended measures: COVID swab with 24–48h turnaround and isolation for 14 days, including isolating from the younger sister (all in D-44). It also accurately reports the ER return precautions (high temperature, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, fainting) from D-44.\n\nMinor inaccuracy: it says that if the swab is negative and symptoms persist, asthma would be considered. In the transcript (D-45), the doctor’s asthma comment is conditional on a different presentation (cough/shortness of breath without fever), not explicitly contingent on a negative swab. This is a small but real shift in meaning.",
    "completeness": "Relative to the Gold Answer, it covers: COVID swab + timing, 14-day isolation, isolate from younger sister, and ER precautions.\n\nIt omits several Gold Answer elements: acknowledgement of possible false-negative swab and that it could be another viral illness (D-44), the explicitly supportive/observational plan/no medications and “wait for swab results” framing (D-44), and the school’s requirement for a COVID test to return (P-41).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (D-44 for testing/isolation/safety-netting; D-45 for mentioning asthma as a differential under certain circumstances). The only partially unfaithful element is the causal framing linking asthma consideration specifically to a negative swab and persistent symptoms, which is not stated that way in the transcript. Otherwise, no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "It directly answers what was asked: diagnostic test, isolation instructions and duration, and who specifically the child should isolate from. The added safety-netting is still part of management and remains relevant."

  "summary": "The answer is strongly aligned with the transcript on testing and 14-day isolation (including separation from the younger sister), but misses some Gold Answer counseling points (false negatives/other viral illness/supportive plan/school requirement) and slightly misframes the asthma comment."
