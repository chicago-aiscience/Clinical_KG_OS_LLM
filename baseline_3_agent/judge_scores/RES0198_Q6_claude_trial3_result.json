  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all the key factual elements from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the diagnosis as 'most likely a viral infection like the common cold,' lists the same two supportive care recommendations (hydration and OTC medications like Tylenol Cold), describes the COVID swab test ordered for today with 48-hour results, and includes the isolation guidance. The Generated Answer omits a few minor details present in the Gold Answer (symptoms taking 'a few weeks' to resolve, acknowledgment that 'there's not much beyond supportive care,' and the mention of 'further instructions from public health' after results), but contains no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer but misses some supporting details. It includes: (1) the working diagnosis, (2) both supportive care recommendations, (3) the diagnostic test ordered, and (4) the isolation instruction. However, it omits: (a) the timeline expectation that symptoms take 'a few weeks' to resolve, (b) the explicit statement about limited treatment options beyond supportive care, and (c) the mention that 'further instructions from public health' would follow after results. These omissions represent approximately 15-20% of the Gold Answer's content, though the core elements are all present.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the source transcript, specifically in segment [D-39]. The diagnosis, supportive care recommendations (hydration, Tylenol Cold), COVID swab test, 48-hour result timeline, and isolation guidance all appear verbatim or very close to verbatim in the doctor's statement. There are no hallucinated facts or unverifiable claims. The answer is well-grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question, which asked for the complete management plan including diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance. Each section is clearly labeled and corresponds to the requested information. There is no irrelevant content, and the structure closely mirrors what was asked for in the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and highly faithful response to the question, correctly capturing the diagnosis, supportive care measures, diagnostic testing, and public health guidance from the transcript. It earns perfect scores for correctness, faithfulness, and relevance. The completeness score is slightly reduced (4/5) due to the omission of a few supporting details present in the Gold Answer: the timeline for symptom resolution ('a few weeks'), the acknowledgment of limited treatment options, and the mention of further public health instructions post-results. Despite these minor omissions, the answer covers all major components of the management plan and is well-organized and directly responsive to the question."
