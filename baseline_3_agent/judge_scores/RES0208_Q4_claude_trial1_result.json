  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims there is 'no explicit evidence' of the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, when these are clearly documented in the transcript at [D-10/P-10], [D-15/P-15], [D-16/P-16], and [D-17/P-17]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies all these specific denials with exact citations. The Generated Answer also incorrectly focuses on symptoms that were confirmed rather than denied, which is the opposite of what the question asked.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not list the specific denied symptoms (runny nose, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling). It does not explain how each denial helps differentiate the diagnosis. It covers less than 20% of the required content, instead focusing on positive symptoms which were not the focus of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes claims that directly contradict the transcript. It states there is 'no explicit evidence' of systematic questioning about denied symptoms, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about runny nose [D-10], nausea [D-15], chest pain [D-16], and palpitations [D-17]. This represents a significant misrepresentation of the source material. However, the positive symptoms mentioned are verifiable in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely off-topic. The question specifically asks about symptoms that were 'explicitly asked about and negated,' but the response primarily discusses symptoms that were confirmed positive. Only the final paragraph attempts to address how denials help differentiate diagnoses, but it does so in a vague, generalized manner without the specific symptom-by-symptom analysis requested. The answer addresses less than 30% of what was actually asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misunderstands the question by focusing on confirmed symptoms rather than denied symptoms. It incorrectly claims there is no evidence of the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, when these questions and denials are clearly documented in the transcript. The answer fails to list the specific denied symptoms or explain their diagnostic significance in the systematic way shown in the Gold Answer. This represents a critical failure in both comprehension and factual accuracy."
