  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer accurately reports key acute symptoms from the transcript (increased cough, green-yellow sputum, small amount of blood with hard coughing, worse dyspnea) and that baseline COPD is usually manageable with puffers. However, it makes unsupported/overstated claims: calls it an “acute severe episode,” states “inability to manage … with home puffers alone” (not stated), and suggests likely need for admission (not stated; clinician only says admission vs discharge will be decided). It also fails to correctly characterize severity vs prior exacerbations because it omits the patient’s explicit statement that this is “probably the worst that I’ve had.”",
    "completeness": "Misses multiple key elements from the gold answer: (1) explicit trajectory over 3 days—patient says symptoms have “maybe [been] getting a little worse” and “definitely haven’t gotten better”; (2) decline in functional/exertional tolerance (dog walks harder though she walked to appointment); (3) baseline rescue inhaler use about once every two weeks; (4) possible fever the night before; (5) comparison to prior exacerbations: explicitly worst episode; (6) prior exacerbation history details—ED twice in 3 years and never admitted overnight. Covers only baseline being manageable and the main acute respiratory symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "Introduces content not grounded in the transcript: references a “knowledge graph,” asserts sputum color/hemoptysis are confirmed exacerbation indicators via that graph, claims the condition is not manageable with puffers alone, and speculates about likely need for admission. These are not directly supported by the transcript, constituting multiple hallucinated or speculative statements.",
    "relevance": "Mostly focused on symptom evolution and severity comparison, but the severity comparison is vague and partly speculative, and it does not directly answer whether symptoms improved or worsened over the 3-day period using the patient’s own statement. Includes minor tangential material (knowledge graph, admission speculation)."
