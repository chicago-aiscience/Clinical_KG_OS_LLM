  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- COPD diagnosis timing: Generated Answer states COPD was diagnosed ~2 years ago [P-1], but the transcript clarifies it was ~5 years ago [P-2]. This is a clear contradiction.\n- Smoking quantity: Generated Answer claims the transcript does not specify exact daily consumption, but it does: currently ~half pack/day, previously 1 pack and up to 2 packs/day [P-44]. This is another direct contradiction.\n- Family history: Correctly reports father had lung cancer and smoked a lot [P-43].\n- COPD exacerbation: Correctly notes clinician impression of COPD exacerbation [D-52].\n- Adds a “knowledge graph” linkage statement not present in the transcript, which is not factually supported by the provided source.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered:\n- Father had lung cancer and was a heavy smoker.\n- Patient is a current smoker.\n- Current visit assessed as COPD exacerbation.\n\nKey Gold Answer elements missed or incorrectly stated:\n- Current smoking level (half pack/day) and prior heavier use (1–2 packs/day) [P-44] (missed and contradicted).\n- Explicit patient concern linking own smoking to father’s lung cancer (“I also smoke so I sometimes worry about that”) [P-43] (not included).\n- Doctor’s acknowledgment/encouragement and offer of cessation resources [D-45] (not included).\n- Chronic cough duration (~10 years) and COPD diagnosis timing (~5 years) [P-3, P-2] (missed/incorrect).\n- Mother reported healthy and no other family history [P-43] (omitted).\n- Denial of other recreational drug use [P-45] (omitted).",
    "faithfulness": "- Contains multiple statements not grounded in, or contradicting, the transcript:\n  - COPD diagnosed ~2 years ago (contradicted by [P-2]).\n  - “Transcript does not specify exact daily consumption” (contradicted by [P-44]).\n  - “knowledge graph supports this context…” (no knowledge graph provided in the transcript; unverifiable).\n- Some elements are grounded (father lung cancer with smoking [P-43], COPD exacerbation assessment [D-52]), but the above issues substantially reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "- The answer is generally focused on smoking history, family history of lung cancer, and how these relate to COPD risk/exacerbation.\n- Minor tangents include treatment plan details; still related but not central to the question."
