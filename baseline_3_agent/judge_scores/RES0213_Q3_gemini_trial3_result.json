  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as anxiety-induced chest pain and provides supporting observations that are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two significant components of the Gold Answer's reasoning: the clinical observation that symptoms resolve during social interaction or distraction (which was part of the prompt's premise) and the use of pertinent negatives (no fever, no worsening with exercise, no asthma) to rule out physiological causes.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical observations and citations provided in the answer are grounded in the transcript. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on the diagnosis and the clinical evidence from the transcript as requested."
