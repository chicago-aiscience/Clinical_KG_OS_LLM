  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the red spots in sputum from P-4, right-sided chest pain from P-17, fever and feeling off from P-5, chills from P-9, bad cough from P-1, and raw throat from P-15, all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript; however, it has minor discrepancies by omitting the 'yellow custard' description of sputum (P-6), full quality of chest pain (constant, dull, worse with cough/deep breath from P-19-21), precise fever onset (Monday, subjective from P-8), and other details like dyspnea, making core facts correct but incomplete in detail.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: partial sputum (red spots yes, yellow custard/appearance no), partial chest pain (location yes, quality/constant/worsening no), systemic fever (partial, misses Monday onset and persistence), chills (yes); also covers cough severity and sore throat; missed: cough timeline (Fri-Sun), full sputum desc, full chest pain details, dyspnea on exertion, runny nose, no weight loss. Covers approximately 50-60% of key points, especially weak on specified sputum description and chest pain quality.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: red gunk/spots (P-4), right pain (P-17), fever/off (P-5), chills (P-9), bad cough (P-1), raw throat (P-15); no hallucinated facts or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around sputum, chest pain, and systemic symptoms as specified in the question, with additional relevant cough and throat symptoms from the consultation; no off-topic content, perfectly focused on reported symptoms."
