  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. Most importantly, it claims the transcript lacks details about nighttime symptoms, which are explicitly provided in P-18 (every other day or every two days). Additionally, it cites P-4 for chest tightness, but P-4 is a response to a question about bronchodilators; the correct citation for chest tightness is P-20. It also uses the 'past week' timeframe from P-1, ignoring the patient's later clarification in P-13 that it has been 'two weeks'.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to address a major part of the prompt regarding the frequency difference between daytime and nighttime. While it lists the symptoms correctly, it misses the specific 'every other day' frequency for nighttime reported in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates an absence of information, stating 'The transcript does not contain specific details regarding the frequency or severity of symptoms during the nighttime' when P-18 contains exactly that. The citation for chest tightness (P-4) is also inaccurate relative to the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. It addresses the list of symptoms but fails to provide the requested comparison of frequency, instead dismissing that part of the question as unanswerable based on the text provided."
