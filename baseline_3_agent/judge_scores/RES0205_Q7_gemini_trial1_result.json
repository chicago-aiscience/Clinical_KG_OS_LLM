  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly accurate but has minor discrepancies. It characterizes the frequency as 'high,' whereas the patient quantified it as 3-4 times per hour and stated it had not increased. Additionally, it omits the patient's specific statement regarding the 'intensity' of the cough remaining the same, which was explicitly asked for in the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it does not mention the absence of fevers, the negative COVID test, or the specific detail that the intensity of the cough remained stable. It also groups 'sore throat' and 'runny nose' under 'flu symptoms' rather than detailing them individually as the Gold Answer does.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. All chronological claims regarding the mucus production and the resolution of early symptoms are supported by the text and cited correctly.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested timeline structure, though it fails to fully address the specific sub-question regarding 'intensity' change."
