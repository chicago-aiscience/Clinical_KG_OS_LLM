  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer mostly aligns with the Gold Answer but contains one chronological error. It states the sore throat developed 'subsequently' to the fever, whereas the transcript [P-1] and the Gold Answer indicate the sore throat (along with the stuffy nose) occurred 'just before' the fever began. Other facts, such as the duration of the fever and the husband's one-week timeline, are correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points: the initial stuffy nose, the fever duration, the sore throat, the muscle aches, and the comparison to the husband's symptom onset (1 week vs 3 days). It successfully captures the core elements of the patient's history.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is grounded in the transcript, but it misinterprets the temporal relationship of the sore throat in [P-1]. By using the word 'subsequently,' it creates a timeline not supported by the patient's statement that the sore throat was present 'just before' the fever.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant. It uses a structured format to address the progression of symptoms and the comparison with the husband as requested in the prompt."
