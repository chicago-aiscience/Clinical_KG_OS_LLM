  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states that the transcript does not specify whether the cough is productive or non-productive. However, the transcript explicitly addresses this: the doctor asks if it is a 'dry cough' [D-5] and the patient confirms [P-5]. Furthermore, the patient explicitly denies bringing up any 'gunk' or sputum [D-6, P-6], confirming it is non-productive. Other details regarding the duration and the nasal discharge are correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies both primary respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and includes the 'pretty clear' description of the discharge. However, it fails to provide the characterization of the cough (dry/non-productive) requested in the prompt, claiming the information is missing when it is present.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a failure in faithfulness by claiming that information regarding the nature of the cough is absent from the transcript. This is a negative hallucination (claiming a lack of information that is actually present).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each part of the prompt (symptoms, duration, nature of cough, and appearance of discharge), though it provides an incorrect conclusion for one of those parts."
