{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the timeline (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening), the location of the tick (behind the knee), the comparison of symptoms (redness/soreness vs. bullseye rash), and the level of engorgement (less than the previous bite).",
    "completeness": "The answer covers nearly all key points. It misses the specific geographic location (Strathroy) and the specific timing of discovery ('earlier today') mentioned in the gold answer. It also omits the doctor's specific 'little grape' analogy for engorgement, though it captures the general comparison of swelling correctly.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript. However, it includes an anomalous citation tag '[KG]' which does not exist in the source transcript, suggesting a minor hallucination of the reference system, though the facts cited remain true to the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses the multi-part question regarding the timeline and the comparison to the prior tick bite experience without irrelevant tangents."
