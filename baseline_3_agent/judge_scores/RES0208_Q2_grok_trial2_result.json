  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists Avodart for prostate enlargement (consistent with Gold's 'enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia)' and transcript P-25/P-26) and Tums for reflux (matches Gold's gastroesophageal reflux and P-27). The change (stopped previous reflux med because figured out foods, P-27) is exactly as in Gold. No factual errors or contradictions, though it omits minor details like '(dutasteride)', OTC status, 'here and there', and patient quote; core facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points: current meds (Avodart and Tums), specific conditions (prostate enlargement/reflux), change to regimen (stopped previous med), and reason (figured out foods). Misses supplementary details from Gold like full drug name, BPH acronym, patient quote, doctor's response, and no allergies, but covers 100% of core question elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims (meds, conditions, change, reason) directly verifiable in cited transcript segments [P-25, P-26, P-27]. Citations accurate. Minor unverifiable addition of 'knowledge graph' (not present in provided transcript), but does not alter facts or introduce hallucinations; content otherwise fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly and comprehensively addresses the question by structuring response around current medications/conditions and the specific change/reason, with no off-topic content."
