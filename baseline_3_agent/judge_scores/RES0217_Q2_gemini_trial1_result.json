  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the current statin therapy and the proposal for prophylactic antibiotics. It also correctly notes the suggestion of insecticide. However, it cites [D-5] for the antibiotic recommendation, whereas the discussion on antibiotics begins in [D-6]. It also attributes the lack of a specific brand name for the statin to the patient not recalling it, which is correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers about 50-60% of the key points in the Gold Answer. It successfully identifies the statin, prophylactic antibiotics, and insecticide. However, it misses several specific points from the Gold Answer: the patient's lack of allergies, the past history of antibiotic treatment for a tick bite 10 years ago, and the doctor's intent to consult a supervising physician before finalizing the plan. It does add diagnostic measures (blood work, exam) which were discussed but not emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly faithful to the transcript but includes a hallucination/meta-reference to a 'medical knowledge graph [KG]' which is not part of the source text. Most other claims are grounded in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on medications and treatments as requested. It organizes the information well and directly addresses the components of the question."
