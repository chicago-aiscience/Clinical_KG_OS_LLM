  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly lists positive symptoms (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches, etc.) as the focus of the review of systems instead of the denied symptoms specified in the Gold Answer and transcript (e.g., runny nose [D-10/P-10], chest pain [D-16/P-16], etc.). It falsely claims no explicit denials of chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, or nausea exist in the transcript, directly contradicting both Gold and source. Introduces unsupported 'Knowledge Graph' for COVID diagnosis. Core facts are wrong, leading to full contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: lists 8 specific denied symptoms with citations (runny nose, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling); explains differentiation (excludes cardiac via chest pain/palpitations absence; GI via nausea/abdominal; common cold via no runny nose; neuro via others; leads to infection/COVID). Generated covers 0% of these, instead listing positives and denying negatives' existence.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims no evidence of denials in transcript, but transcript explicitly shows doctor asking and patient denying multiple symptoms (e.g., [D-10/P-10] runny nose 'No'; [D-15/P-15] nausea 'No'; [D-16/P-16] chest pain 'No'; etc.). Cites irrelevant [D-36] for symptoms; fabricates 'Knowledge Graph'; misrepresents sore throat/cough as fully confirmed when patient says 'starting to feel/maybe'. Multiple hallucinations and inaccurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Question specifically asks for denied symptoms in ROS and their role in differentiating diagnosis. Generated shifts to positive symptoms, denies negatives exist, and provides vague/incorrect differentiation using external references, failing to directly address or list the pertinent negatives or their diagnostic utility."
