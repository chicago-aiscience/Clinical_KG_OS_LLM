  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. While it correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) with accurate citations, it incorrectly states that the doctor did not screen for fever, joint pain, and headaches. The Gold Answer clearly shows the doctor asked about joint pain [D-7], feeling ill/feverish [D-8], and headaches [D-19], all of which were denied by the patient [P-7, P-8, P-19, P-20]. This is a major factual error directly contradicting the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50% of the key points. It accurately details the local symptoms but completely misses the entire second half of the question regarding systemic symptoms the doctor screened for and the patient denied. The Gold Answer explicitly documents three categories of systemic symptoms (joint pain, fever/feeling ill, headaches) with citations, while the Generated Answer incorrectly claims this screening did not occur.",
    "faithfulness": "The local symptoms section is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1], [P-3], [P-6]. However, the systemic symptoms section contains a critical faithfulness error. The transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about joint pain [D-7], fever [D-8], and headaches [D-19], yet the Generated Answer claims these questions were not asked. This represents a failure to accurately reflect the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question structure by separating local and systemic symptoms. However, the systemic symptoms portion fails to provide the requested information, instead incorrectly claiming the data is unavailable. While the local symptoms section is highly relevant and focused, the systemic symptoms section is incomplete and misleading rather than providing the clearly documented screening questions and denials."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies and documents the local symptoms at the tick bite site with proper citations, earning credit for that portion. However, it contains a critical error in stating the doctor did not screen for fever, joint pain, and headaches, when the transcript clearly shows these questions were asked [D-7, D-8, D-19] and denied by the patient [P-7, P-8, P-19, P-20]. This represents both a factual error and a failure to address half of the question's requirements, significantly impacting correctness, completeness, and faithfulness scores."
