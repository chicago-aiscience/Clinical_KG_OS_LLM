  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's plan from [D-37], including the specific physical exam components (quick listen to heart and lungs, quick physical exam) and the collaborative process (consult with supervising doctor, review discussion, return to discuss next steps), with no factual errors or contradictions compared to the Gold Answer's core description.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: physical exam specifics (auscultation of heart/lungs and quick physical exam), detailed collaborative process (consult supervising doctor, review everything discussed, return together for next steps). Missed: foreshadowing in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], note on no diagnosis/medication yet, and transcript ending before findings/decisions (about 20% of Gold's content).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-37] of the transcript with accurate paraphrasing and quoting (e.g., 'quick listen to your heart and lungs', 'go get the doctor that I'm working with', 'go over everything you talked about', 'where to go from here'); no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the two specified elements (physical exam components and process for next steps) with direct reference to the relevant transcript turn, no off-topic content."
