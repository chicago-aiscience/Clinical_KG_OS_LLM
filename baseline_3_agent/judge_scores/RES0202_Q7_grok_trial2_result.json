  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline: cough starting Wednesday evening as 'little dry cough' [P-1], persisting and slightly worsening Thursday with tiredness [P-1], worsening Friday with new fever >100°F [P-1, P-2]. It matches Gold on fever emerging Friday, decreased appetite [P-15, P-17], and fatigue (Thursday [P-1], continued Friday). Minor discrepancies include quoting Thursday cough as 'a bit of a cough' instead of explicitly 'little bit worse' (still consistent), attributing Friday fatigue to [P-8] speculation on breathing (mild overinterpretation), omitting runny nose [P-16] and mother's summary [P-12, P-4], and adding irrelevant doctor inquiries [D-13] and advice [D-44]. Core facts align with Gold without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Wed eve - fine post-school, dry cough onset; Thu - cough worse, tired; Fri - cough worsening, first fever (100+°F), appetite loss/taste suspicion, significant fatigue, runny nose, mother summary [P-12], 3-day correction [P-4]. Generated covers ~90%: cough progression and timing across days, fever Friday, fatigue Thu/Fri, appetite/taste Friday. Misses runny nose, explicit Thursday worsening phrasing, P-12/P-4 references. Adds minor extras but covers all major symptom evolutions.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims verifiable: cough details [P-1], tired Thu [P-1], worse Fri [P-1], fever [P-1/P-2], appetite [P-15], taste [P-17], less active [P-8]. Minor unverifiable: 'perhaps struggling slightly with breathing' infers from parent's speculation [P-8] ('maybe harder time breathing'); doctor inquiries [D-13] and COVID advice [D-44] are in transcript but not symptoms. No hallucinations, mostly grounded with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures day-by-day evolution matching question's focus on cough onset/severity changes (Wed-Thu-Fri progression), fever/other symptoms timing (fatigue Thu/Fri, appetite Fri). Minor tangents: speculative breathing, doctor questions [D-13], treatment summary [D-44] at end, but core content perfectly on-topic."
