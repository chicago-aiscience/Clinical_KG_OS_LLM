  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reconstructs the main timeline: hiking on Friday, gardening on Saturday, uncertain attachment timing, discovery and removal “earlier today,” and presentation with the tick in a plastic container. It also correctly captures the clinician’s estimate that, given Friday/Saturday outdoor exposure, the tick may have been attached >72 hours [D-6].\n\nComparison to prior episode is mostly correct: ~10 years ago there was a bullseye/target rash and antibiotics; prior tick was more engorged (“quite swollen”) while the current tick is less engorged. However, there are minor inaccuracies/ambiguities: it implies the “past event ... was described as ‘quite swollen’” in a way that could be read as the rash being swollen rather than the tick being engorged (in the transcript, “quite swollen” refers to the tick). It also says “the current tick did not look like the past one (referring to the target rash),” which conflates tick appearance with rash appearance and is not clearly supported by the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: Friday hike and Saturday gardening; patient unsure when she acquired the tick and hoped it was from hiking; discovery due to soreness/tenderness behind the left knee; embedded tick removed and brought in a plastic container; clinician comments on >72 hours; prior episode ~10 years ago with bullseye rash and antibiotics; current episode lacks bullseye rash and is mainly local redness/tenderness; current tick less engorged than prior.\n\nNot fully covered/missed: the hiking location (Strathroy along the creek) is omitted; the Gold Answer’s explicit contrast that the current tick was “pretty small” [P-4] and the clinician’s “little grape” engorgement description [D-4] are not explicitly included (the answer implies less engorgement but doesn’t clearly state the tick was “pretty small”).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript. Minor issues: the inclusion of an unexplained bracket “[KG]” suggests a non-transcript citation; “symptoms ... manageable” is interpretive and not directly stated. The tick-vs-rash wording (“did not look like that”) is slightly unfaithful to the patient’s actual phrasing (she said the current episode didn’t look like the prior episode with the target rash, and the prior tick was more swollen). No major fabricated events are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on what the question asked: (1) the Friday-to-Saturday-to-discovery/presentation timeline and (2) how the patient compared current local symptoms and engorgement to the prior tick bite with bullseye rash and antibiotics. No meaningful tangents."
