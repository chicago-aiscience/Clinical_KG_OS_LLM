  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error. It claims the patient reported a loss of smell (anosmia), whereas the transcript explicitly states the patient did 'not' lose their sense of smell [P-19]. It also overlooks critical symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as difficulty breathing and muscle aches.",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete as it misses several key components of the clinical picture: the new-onset difficulty breathing, the muscle aches, and the potential exposure settings mentioned in the Gold Answer. It focuses almost exclusively on the sore throat and the sensory changes.",
    "faithfulness": "The response exhibits significant hallucinations. It claims the patient reported a loss of smell despite quoting the opposite. Furthermore, it references an external 'Knowledge Graph' and specific mapping logic that does not exist in the provided source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer fails to address the specific nuance of the question, which asked how 'reduced taste without loss of smell' supported the reasoning. Instead, it incorrectly argued that the patient did have a loss of smell and used that as the primary justification for the diagnosis."
