  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the only reported medication use as intermittent OTC antihistamines (e.g., Reactine) for seasonal allergies and correctly states there are no prescribed/regular medications. However, it introduces an incorrect claim that the child is \"currently being evaluated for a viral infection\" causing the wheeze; the transcript does not support that (no fever/runny nose/sick contacts, and prior viral infections were historical). It also overstates Reactine as \"currently part of her regimen\" rather than clearly intermittent/occasional use.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) occasional OTC Reactine/OTC allergy meds; (2) no prescribed medications. Key points partially covered or missed: it implies no medication for the current episode but does not explicitly capture the mother’s clear statement that she gives the child nothing for wheezing episodes and that they resolve on their own with rest; it also omits the detail that past infections did not require antibiotics (less central to the question but included in the Gold Answer). Overall, most major medication-management points are present.",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not grounded in the transcript: (1) labeling the current presentation as a \"viral infection\"; (2) reference to a \"knowledge graph\" confirming Reactine’s use (not part of the provided transcript). Most other claims (Reactine/OTC use; no prescriptions; no meds mentioned for current episode) are supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the question (medications/treatments taken for the episodes or other conditions, and whether prescribed meds are involved) and does not add major irrelevant content."

  "summary": "Mostly matches the Gold Answer on OTC Reactine use and absence of prescribed meds, but includes ungrounded statements (notably calling the current episode a viral infection and citing a “knowledge graph”) and is less explicit about giving nothing for the wheezing episodes."
