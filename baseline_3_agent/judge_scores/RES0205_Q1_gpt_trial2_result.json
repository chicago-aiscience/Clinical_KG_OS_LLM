  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the persistent 2-week cough and that it was initially productive with whitish/clear mucus and later became dry. However, it inaccurately states the patient has “chest pain” as an ongoing symptom: the patient denied chest pain and described only mild chest soreness/hurting after coughing a lot (i.e., cough-related soreness rather than independent chest pain). This is a clinically meaningful nuance.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements missing include: (1) resolved sore throat (first 2–3 days), (2) resolved runny nose/“flu symptoms” that resolved in ~3–4 days, (3) current cough details (3–4 times/hour, spontaneous/no triggers, stable intensity and frequency), and (4) explicit pertinent negatives (no dyspnea, no fever, no N/V, no abdominal pain). It includes only the mucus phase as resolved and only a subset of persisting symptom characterization.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (persistent cough; initial mucus then dry). The “chest pain” phrasing is slightly overstated versus the transcript’s description of cough-related soreness, but it is still loosely traceable to the patient saying their chest hurts a little when coughing too much. No major fabricated symptoms beyond that wording issue.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on symptoms during the illness and distinguishes resolved vs ongoing symptoms. However, it omits several reported symptoms and symptom characteristics that are directly relevant to the question."
