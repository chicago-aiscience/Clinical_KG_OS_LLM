  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error. It claims the patient reported a 'loss of smell (anosmia)' and uses this as a primary clinical indicator for COVID-19. However, the transcript [P-19] and the Gold Answer explicitly state the patient had reduced taste *but not* loss of smell. Furthermore, the Generated Answer omits several key symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as difficulty breathing, fatigue, and muscle aches, which were central to the doctor's suspicion.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It misses the difficulty breathing (a major symptom started 'yesterday'); 2) It misses the muscle aches and fatigue; 3) It misses the context regarding the patient's exposure risk (grocery store/bank). It focuses only on the sore throat and the incorrectly interpreted sensory symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. In [P-19], the patient says 'maybe taste a little bit but not smell.' The Generated Answer claims the patient reported a 'loss of smell' and that this validated the diagnosis. Additionally, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the provided source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant because it fails to address the specific premise of the question. The question asks how 'reduced taste without loss of smell' supports the reasoning. The Generated Answer instead argues that 'loss of smell' supports the reasoning, directly contradicting the prompt's constraints and the transcript's facts."
