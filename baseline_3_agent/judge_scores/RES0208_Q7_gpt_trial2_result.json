  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly places shortness of breath, fatigue/rundown, weakness, and decreased appetite as present for the last couple of days (matches [P-1], [P-2]). It correctly places subjective fever as occurring yesterday ([P-4]). However, it incorrectly categorizes loss of taste as a symptom “just beginning to emerge at the time of consultation.” In the transcript and Gold Answer, loss of taste was noticed the morning of the consultation as a distinct new symptom ([P-4]), not merely “emerging” during the visit like the cough/sore throat. It also omits/does not address the “laborious” breathing characterization ([P-3]) and does not address smell loss timing ([P-6]) or the “entirely new” nature of sensory change ([P-5]).",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) onset symptoms: SOB, fatigue/rundown, weakness, decreased appetite; (2) yesterday: subjective fever; (3) emerging at consult: cough and sore throat.\nMisses key Gold Answer points: (a) breathing described as more laborious rather than inability to breathe ([P-3]); (b) generalized body aches/overall achy ([P-20], [P-21]); (c) diminished smell acknowledged when asked ([P-6]) and its linkage to the new sensory change ([P-5]); (d) mild headaches with unclear change from baseline ([P-11], [P-12]). Also misplaces loss of taste into the “emerging” bucket rather than “noticed that morning.” Overall coverage is partial (~50–79%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded with transcript citations (fatigue/SOB [P-1], weakness/appetite [P-2], fever [P-4], taste loss [P-4], cough/sore throat [P-7], [P-9], clinician summary [D-36]). However, referencing a “provided medical knowledge graph” and claims like “aligns with symptoms…relate to COVID-19 diagnoses” are not supported by the transcript and introduce extraneous, unverifiable content. Still, the core timeline reconstruction largely uses transcript data.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on reconstructing symptom timing and largely follows the asked structure (onset vs yesterday vs emerging). Minor issues: it misclassifies loss of taste into the ‘emerging’ category and includes irrelevant mention of a knowledge graph/COVID alignment, but it remains mostly on-task."
