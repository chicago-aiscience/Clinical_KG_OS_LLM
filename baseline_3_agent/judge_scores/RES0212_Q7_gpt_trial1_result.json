  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states initial onset ~3 months ago with intermittent course, productive greenish sputum in the past few days, and subjective nighttime “hot” feelings in the past couple days. However, it incorrectly places the onset of nightly sleep disruption in “the last three days.” The transcript specifies the cough has been waking her up “pretty well…every night…for…probably the last month” ([P-21]), not the last three days. This is a major timeline error relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) onset ~3 months ago, (2) cough intermittent/comes and goes, (3) became productive with greenish sputum a few days before visit, (4) subjective fevers in past couple days. Key elements missed or inadequately captured: (a) explicit clarification that nocturnal awakenings have been present for ~1 month (not 3 months), (b) that the cough was dry for most of the preceding period before turning productive, and (c) the more specific “~3 days” timing for onset of productive sputum. Overall coverage is partial due to the sleep-disruption timing error and missing dry-vs-productive evolution detail.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript ([P-2], [P-4], [P-9]). However, the claim that sleep disruption began in the last three days is not supported by the cited line ([D-47])—that line summarizes that the cough only became “bad” in the last three days, while the patient separately reports nightly awakenings for about a month ([P-21]). This is a misattribution/misinterpretation of the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested cough timeline (onset, nightly sleep disruption, productive green sputum, subjective fevers) and does not add unrelated material."

  "summary": "Relevant and partly accurate, but it contains a major error in the timing of when the cough began disrupting sleep nightly (should be ~1 month, not last 3 days), reducing correctness, completeness, and faithfulness."
