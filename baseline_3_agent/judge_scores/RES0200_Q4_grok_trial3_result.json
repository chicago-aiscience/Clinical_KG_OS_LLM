  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the alternative diagnosis as 'Covid' (equivalent to Gold's 'COVID-19'), the test as 'covid swab' (matches Gold's 'COVID swab'), and turnaround time as '24 to 48 hours' (exact match). It correctly notes symptom overlap and provides precise citations from [D-52], with no factual errors or contradictions compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: alternative diagnosis (Covid), diagnostic test (covid swab), expected turnaround time (24 to 48 hours), and citations [D-52]. Missed: full expansion to 'COVID-19', detailed patient symptoms (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills), and note that specific overlapping symptoms were not detailed by doctor. However, covers 100% of the question's core elements (diagnosis, test, TAT).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript: 'symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid', 'covid swab', 'hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours'. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the three specific elements (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time) with no off-topic content or tangents."
