  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as a “cardiac ischemic” (ischemic/cardiac) picture, consistent with the gold answer and transcript [D-36]. It accurately reports the clinician’s reasoning that symptoms were characterized as chest tightness rather than classic cardiac pain and that the patient “didn’t really get out of breath with exercise” per the clinician’s interpretation [D-36]. No direct contradictions or false claims are present.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the gold answer that are covered: (1) cardiac ischemic picture lowered on the differential; (2) chest complaints framed as tightness rather than pain; (3) clinician noted lack of exertional dyspnea in a classic cardiac pattern.\nKey points missed: the gold answer also includes pertinent negatives explicitly screened—denial of anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom [P-6/D-6]—as part of the rationale for lowering ischemia. The generated answer only mentions absence of pain and omits these additional “cardiac red flag” negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are supported by the transcript: ischemia being lower on the differential [D-36], the clinician’s statement about not getting out of breath with exercise and the symptom being tightness [D-36], and absence of pain [D-36/P-5]. No clear hallucinated symptoms or unsupported details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what condition was lowered and what symptom findings/absences supported that decision. It stays focused on the asked elements (condition + nature of chest complaint + absent symptoms), though it incompletely lists the absent symptoms."

  "summary": "Accurately identifies cardiac ischemia as lower on the differential and cites tightness/no exertional dyspnea and no pain, but omits other key pertinent negatives (no anxiety/sweats/impending doom) emphasized in the gold answer."
