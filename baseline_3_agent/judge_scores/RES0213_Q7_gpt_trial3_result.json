  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is broadly consistent with the transcript that the patient had anxiety attacks as a teenager (discussed with her family doctor), has been stressed in recent weeks due to a thesis/time crunch, and developed sharp pleuritic chest discomfort about 1.5 weeks ago lasting ~20 minutes and not relieved by OTC meds. However, it introduces inaccuracies/overstatements relative to the Gold Answer: it implies a more continuous/“long-standing” anxiety course, whereas the patient reported an ~8-year gap without significant anxiety symptoms. It also does not correctly place smoking onset/timeline (age 18 occasional use, then escalation to ~10/day over the last two years, then halving a few months ago) and omits the father’s heart attack as an important link to her cardiac worry. Some statements (e.g., smoking as a ‘risk factor’ in a ‘knowledge graph’) are not part of the source content and move beyond the Gold Answer framing.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: teen anxiety and discussion with family doctor; recent escalation of academic stress (Masters thesis/time crunch); onset of chest pain ~1.5 weeks ago with pleuritic quality; some linkage between stress/anxiety and symptoms. Key points missed or insufficiently specified: smoking began around age 18 and was occasional at first; escalation to ~10 cigarettes/day for the last two years; cutting down by half a few months ago; ~8 years without anxiety symptoms; father’s heart attack last year and the resulting fear of a cardiac cause; that pain is more noticeable when alone and less when distracted; explicit mention that she worries anxiety attacks may be returning. Overall, it covers roughly half to two-thirds of the Gold Answer’s timeline details and relational links.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “knowledge graph,” classification of smoking as a risk factor from that graph, and the framing of a continuous anxiety progression. The transcript does support that she breathes faster when nervous and that palpitations/flutter were only with past anxiety attacks, but the answer extrapolates these as baseline anxiety physiology. Most cited content about stress and chest pain timing/character is supported, but there are enough non-transcript additions and overinterpretations to reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested timeline (smoking/anxiety/stress/chest pain) and attempts to explain how phases relate, with minimal extraneous content beyond the “knowledge graph” framing."

  "summary": "Captures the general arc (teen anxiety → recent thesis stress → chest pain onset) but misses multiple key timeline/linking details from the Gold Answer (smoking onset/escalation, 8-year anxiety gap, father’s MI, distraction effect) and includes some ungrounded additions (\"knowledge graph,\" risk-factor claims)."
