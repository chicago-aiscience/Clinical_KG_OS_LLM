{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately matches Gold: first symptom scratchy throat then dry cough [P-4]; feeling hot is concurrent/constant alongside respiratory symptoms, head pounding, and malaise, with no specific before/after timing stated; physician summary as 'little bit of fever' included. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: 3-4 day duration implied but not explicit; initial scratchy throat then dry cough; hot sensation persistent/concurrent with cough/throat (covers no exact relative timing, constant day/night via citations); mentions alongside head pounding/crappy. Missed: explicit 3-4 days statement, full list of by-visit symptoms (fatigue [P-13], detailed malaise), wearing shorts/tank detail [P-9], explicit progression from upper airway to systemic. Covers ~85% core points focused on question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: throat-then-cough [P-4]; hot concurrent/constant [P-1,P-7,P-9]; physician fever summary [D-58 implied]; no hallucinations, citations accurate to transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom order (throat -> cough) and hot's relation (concurrent/constant alongside cough/throat, not before/after), perfectly focused on question with no off-topic content."
