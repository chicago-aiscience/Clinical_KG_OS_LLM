  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns with the Gold Answer on the core timeline (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening, uncertain acquisition, discovered tick behind left knee, removed and brought in container, clinician estimates >72 hours) and on the key comparison to the prior episode (~10 years ago with target/bullseye rash and antibiotics; prior tick more engorged; current tick small/less engorged; current bite has localized redness/tenderness without bullseye). Minor inaccuracies/ambiguities: it implies the past event’s “quite swollen” refers to the rash rather than the tick (in the transcript, swelling/engorgement refers to the tick), and it includes an extra “[KG]” tag and a lightly interpretive statement (“symptoms…manageable”) not explicitly stated. These do not overturn the main clinical facts.",
    "completeness": "Covers most Gold Answer elements: hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertainty about where exposure occurred, discovery after soreness, removal and bringing tick in container, clinician’s >72h estimate, prior bullseye rash and antibiotics, and current tick less engorged/small with only local redness/tenderness and no larger rash. Misses or under-specifies a few details present in the Gold Answer: the hiking location (Strathroy) and the doctor’s explicit “little grape” engorgement comparison. Overall coverage is high but not total.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (activity timeline, uncertainty of attachment time, location behind knee, container, engorgement comparison, prior bullseye rash and antibiotics, lack of current bullseye). Minor ungrounded/extra elements include the stray “[KG]” citation and a small interpretive phrasing about symptom severity (“manageable”), and slight imprecision about what was “quite swollen” in the past (tick vs rash). These are limited; the answer is largely grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by describing the exposure timeline from Friday hiking through Saturday gardening to discovery/presentation, and by comparing current local symptoms and engorgement to the prior episode with bullseye rash and antibiotic treatment. No meaningful tangents."
