  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on the core facts: the patient had not tried any OTC medications or self-treatment prior to the visit, and the clinician recommended a COVID-19 diagnostic swab test with expected turnaround of 1–2 days and self-isolation instructions (including potentially longer isolation if symptoms persist despite a negative test). No contradictory or incorrect treatment/medication claims were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) no self-treatment/OTC meds tried; (2) COVID swab test recommended; (3) results may take 1–2 days; (4) self-isolate until results, possibly longer if symptoms persist.\nKey points missed/understated: (a) the explicit confirmation that the patient takes no regular medications (Gold cites D-24/P-24); (b) the clinician’s mention that there “might be a couple other tests” and they would review with the supervising doctor before finalizing the plan (Gold cites D-40).",
    "faithfulness": "The statements made are supported by the transcript (notably D-9/P-9 and D-39). No medications were invented, and the isolation and timeline instructions are accurately represented. The brief mention of a “knowledge graph” is extraneous but does not introduce unsupported clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what the patient tried beforehand (nothing) and what the doctor recommended during the visit (COVID swab test) with associated instructions (timeline and isolation). No meaningful off-topic content."
