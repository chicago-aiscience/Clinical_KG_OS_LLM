  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the geographic distribution map. The transcript explicitly shows the doctor stating 'I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up' [D-13] and then concluding 'Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point' [D-13]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states 'The provided transcript **does not contain evidence** that the doctor used an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map.' This directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer adequately covers the timeline calculation (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, leading to >72 hours attachment), which matches the Gold Answer. However, it completely misses the geographic distribution map component, which is a critical element of the question. It covers approximately 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer - correctly addressing the duration calculation but incorrectly denying the map usage.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is partially faithful to the transcript. The timeline analysis is grounded in the source material [P-1, D-6]. However, the explicit denial of map usage contradicts the transcript evidence at [D-12] and [D-13], where the doctor clearly discusses checking the Lyme disease distribution map and using Strathroy's position on it to inform the decision. This represents a significant hallucination/misrepresentation.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both components of the question: duration calculation and geographic justification. However, by incorrectly denying one of the key elements asked about (the map usage), it fails to provide a complete and accurate response to what was specifically requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies and explains the 72-hour attachment duration calculation based on the Friday hiking and Saturday gardening timeline. However, it contains a critical factual error by explicitly denying that the doctor used an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor referencing this map at [D-13] and using Strathroy's position on it to justify treatment. This represents a significant omission of approximately 50% of the question's required content and directly contradicts both the Gold Answer and source material."
