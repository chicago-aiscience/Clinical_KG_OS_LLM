  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the Gold Answer's triad of symptoms (dry cough worsening over days with matching citations P-1/P-5 vs Gold's P-1/P-5/P-12; fever >100°F/100.1-101°F with identical citations P-1/P-2; possible loss of taste P-17). It correctly reflects the doctor's statements on COVID alignment [D-44, minor 'allowed' vs Gold's 'aligned' but transcript confirms 'allowed'] and use of fever to conclude infection over asthma [D-45], including systemic aspects like appetite loss. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key Gold points: exact triad symptoms with citations; explicit COVID alignment [D-44]; fever's role in favoring infection vs asthma [D-45]; collective use for viral/COVID prioritization including acute onset/systemic features. 100% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: cough details [P-1,P-4,P-5,P-12]; fever [P-1,P-2]; taste/appetite [P-17]; COVID alignment quote [D-44]; infection reasoning distinguishing asthma via fever [D-45]. No hallucinations; citations precise.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by structuring response around specified symptom combination (respiratory complaint, temperature, taste change) leading to COVID alignment and infectious conclusion via collective reasoning, with no off-topic content."
