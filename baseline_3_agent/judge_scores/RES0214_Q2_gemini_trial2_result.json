  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medication (multivitamins) and the drug allergy (Penicillin). However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the adverse reaction. Transcript segment [P-38] explicitly states that the patient gets a 'rash'.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including the specific adverse reaction (rash), the absence of breathing difficulties during the reaction, and the context that the patient is not on medications for her pre-diabetes, high blood pressure, or cholesterol.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness by claiming the transcript does not specify the reaction when it is clearly present in [P-38]. Additionally, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant as it structure itself to answer each part of the user's multi-part question directly."
