    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error in its opening statement, claiming that only patient turns are present in the transcript when in fact the full doctor-patient dialogue is provided, including all relevant questions [D-22] through [D-34]. This fundamental misreading invalidates much of the analysis. The response then attempts to infer what questions might have been asked rather than analyzing the actual questions and responses present in the transcript. The Gold Answer correctly references specific turn numbers for both questions and responses (e.g., [D-22]/[P-22], [D-23]/[P-23]), while the Generated Answer incorrectly claims these interactions are not present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the actual patient responses to the four screening questions, which is the core of what was asked. It misses: (1) The patient's denial of weight loss [P-22], (2) Travel to Sarnia about a week ago [P-23], (3) Denial of sick contacts [P-24], and (4) Limited chemical exposure working on engineering side [P-34]. Instead, it provides generic differential diagnosis reasoning without connecting to the actual responses. The Gold Answer covers all four questions with specific responses and their diagnostic implications.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination - it claims the transcript only contains patient turns and lacks the doctor's questions. This is directly contradicted by the source material which clearly shows the full dialogue including [D-22] through [D-34]. Additionally, it references symptoms and details that, while present in the transcript, are used to construct a hypothetical analysis rather than analyzing the actual exchange that occurred. The claim that 'the patient's responses to these specific inquiries are not available for analysis' is entirely fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the actual question asked. Instead of analyzing how the doctor's four specific screening questions (weight loss, travel, sick contacts, chemical exposure) related to differential diagnoses and how the patient's actual responses narrowed the differential, it provides a general discussion of what these questions theoretically screen for. The lengthy discussion of presenting symptoms in the summary section is largely irrelevant to the specific question about the four screening questions."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally fails the evaluation due to a critical factual error claiming the transcript lacks the doctor's questions and patient's responses to the four screening questions. This false premise invalidates the entire analysis. The response then provides generic theoretical reasoning about differential diagnoses rather than analyzing the actual documented exchange. It misses all specific patient responses (denial of weight loss, Sarnia travel, no sick contacts, limited chemical exposure) and fails to discuss how these responses affected the differential diagnosis. The answer demonstrates complete unfaithfulness to the source material and does not address the question asked."
