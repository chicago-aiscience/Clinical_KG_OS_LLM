  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two proposed procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) with accurate citations [D-37, D-39] matching the Gold Answer. The rationale for the COVID swab is quoted precisely from the transcript and aligns with the Gold's description of institutional protocol. Minor discrepancy: adds 'noted in the knowledge graph' which is not in the Gold Answer or transcript, but core facts remain consistent. No major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: two procedures (chest X-ray [D-37], COVID swab [D-39]), rationale for COVID swab (institutional protocol quote [D-39]). Missed: confirmation of no medications/history with cites [D-27/P-27, P-24/P-26], X-ray explanation [D-39], swab discomfort/reassurance details [D-39], plan to arrange/discuss [D-40], no treatments prescribed. Covers core question elements (~70% of Gold's detailed points).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about procedures and rationale are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [D-37, D-39]. Minor hallucination: 'knowledge graph' reference not present in transcript. Otherwise fully grounded, no other fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing proposed procedures and quoting the exact rationale for COVID swab; no off-topic content or tangents."
