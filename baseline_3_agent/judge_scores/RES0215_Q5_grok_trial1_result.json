  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links seasonal allergies to atopic constitution and asthma association [P-35, P-36]; recurrent viral infections [P-15, P-16] to airway inflammation/hyperresponsiveness; new carpets [P-54] as potential irritant without direct temporal link; cold weather [P-38] as non-allergic bronchospasm trigger; notes other environmental assessments (no smoking [P-53], pets [P-55], wood stoves [P-56], air filters [P-57]); ties to exercise [P-3, P-41] and rest resolution [P-6] suggesting hyperresponsive airways. Generated Answer covers similar links for allergies, virals, carpets, cold, and exercise; no direct contradictions, but adds unsubstantiated claims like 'recurrence/complication of viral trigger' (contradicts lack of fever/runny nose [P-7, P-8]) and omits nuances like no temporal link for carpets and other env factors. Core facts align with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: atopic from allergies/antihistamine; virals trigger inflammation; carpets irritant (no link); cold trigger; other env cleared; exercise/rest pattern → hyperresp asthma-like. Generated covers allergies (susceptibility), virals (vulnerability), carpets/cold (triggers), exercise; misses explicit atopic/asthma link, other env factors, rest resolution in conclusion, temporal nuance. Covers ~85% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript citations [P-1,2,3,15,35,36,38,41,54] accurate. However, multiple hallucinations: 'Knowledge Graph' references entirely absent from transcript (e.g., 'viral infection [CAUSES] wheezy', 'cold weather [WORSENS] wheezy', 'carpets [ASSOCIATED_WITH] wheezy', Reactine--[TAKEN_FOR]--> allergies); infers current as 'recurrence/complication of previous viral' not supported (no current infection signs [P-7-10]). Multiple fabricated causal claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the four specified factors (allergies, recurrent virals, new carpets, cold sensitivity) and their collective relation to exercise-induced wheezing/distress via structured sections and conclusion tying to triggers/predispositions; current presentation section contextualizes pattern without digression."
