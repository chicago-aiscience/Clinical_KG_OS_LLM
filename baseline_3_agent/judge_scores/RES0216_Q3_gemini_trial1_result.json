  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the history of asthma, the symptoms of chest tightness and difficulty breathing, and the exclusion of cardiac causes based on the absence of pain and specific exertional patterns. It matches the transcript's logic where the doctor moves cardiac issues lower on the differential.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several significant points found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention the patient's medication non-compliance (skipping evening doses and not having a rescue inhaler), which was a key part of the doctor's summary (D-34). It also omits the lack of environmental triggers and the doctor's proposal of a therapeutic trial with rescue puffers as a way to link the findings to the diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is grounded in the transcript. The citations provided ([P-1], [P-11], [D-35], [D-36], etc.) are accurate and correspond to the clinical discussion.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying the symptoms, history, and the linking logic used by the doctor."
