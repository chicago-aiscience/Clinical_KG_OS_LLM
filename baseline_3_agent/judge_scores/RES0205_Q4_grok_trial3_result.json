  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and the COVID test as the specific test used, with accurate negative result and citation [P-35]. Timing is described as during the 2-week symptom period citing [P-2] and [P-35], but Gold Answer precisely notes 'at onset, two weeks prior' from [P-36], introducing a minor discrepancy in precision without contradiction. Workplace concerns cover hospital employment [P-17] and coworkers' fear [P-35], aligning with core facts, but omit specifics like 'clerk' role [P-34], PPE use [P-17], staying home [P-36], eagerness to return, and medication desire tied to work—minor omissions but core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: COVID-19 (yes), COVID test [P-35] negative (yes), timing at onset two weeks prior [P-36] (partially, approximates duration but misses exact phrasing/citation). Workplace concerns: hospital work (partial), coworkers scared [P-35] (yes); missed: clerk [P-34], PPE [P-17], staying home post-test [P-36], desire to return without coughing [P-36], meds for workplace return. Covers ~70% of key points (core elements present but details incomplete).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: COVID/test/negative verifiable [P-35]; cough 2 weeks [P-2]; hospital [P-17]; scared coworkers [P-35]. Timing claim verifiable via [P-36] (though cited indirectly via [P-2]/[P-35]); no hallucinations or fabrications. Minor issue: timing attribution to [P-35] inaccurate (actual in [P-36]), but plausible and verifiable overall.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the four question elements (condition, test, timing relative to onset, workplace concerns) with no off-topic content, perfectly matching query focus."
