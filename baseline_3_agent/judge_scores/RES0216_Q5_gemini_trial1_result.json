  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error by stating that the transcript 'does not explicitly contain details regarding the patient's specific self-adherence behaviors.' In reality, the patient clearly states they stopped refilling the rescue inhaler (P-17) and skipped evening doses of the maintenance inhaler (P-19). This directly contradicts the source text and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to address the specific components of the question (skipping doses and failure to refill). While it correctly identifies the general diagnosis of asthma recurrence and mentions the history of asthma, it misses 80% of the key logical links provided in the Gold Answer regarding how these behaviors led to the current symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source transcript in two ways: first, it hallucinates that the adherence information is missing from the text; second, it cites a 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' which does not exist in the provided source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it correctly identifies the symptoms and the suspected condition (asthma), it fails to answer the 'how' part of the question regarding the specific behaviors mentioned in the prompt, essentially dismissing them as non-existent in the data provided. This makes the response largely avoid the specific query constraints. It also includes irrelevant references to a Knowledge Graph [KG]. "
