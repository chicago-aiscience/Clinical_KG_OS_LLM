  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the positive symptoms mentioned in the doctor's summary. It attributes the goal of 'next steps' to Jessica, which she agreed to, although the gold answer more accurately highlights her specific request about medication from P-60.",
    "completeness": "The response is significantly incomplete compared to the gold answer. It misses several clinical findings mentioned in the doctor's recap (D-58), including the absence of sputum, the absence of asthma, the clarification on her medication usage, and the detail regarding sick contacts. It also omits Jessica's specific primary goal regarding medication and her desire to rest as mentioned in P-60 and P-61.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly traceable to the transcript, specifically sections D-58 and P-60.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused and directly addresses both parts of the user's question without including extraneous or off-topic information."
