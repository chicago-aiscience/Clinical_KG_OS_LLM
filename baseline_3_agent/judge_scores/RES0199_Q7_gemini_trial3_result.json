  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the onset of headache and cough (4 days ago), loss of smell (1 day ago), and the stability of the cough and headache.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but is slightly less detailed than the gold answer. It misses the specific timing for the onset of diarrhea (2 days ago), instead grouping it with general gastrointestinal symptoms 'a few days back'. It also omits the specific 7/10 severity rating for the headache and the detail that it was a dry cough.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript, using direct quotes and correct speaker tags ([P-1], [P-24], [P-32], etc.). No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the timeline of symptom development, the specific order of onset, and the stability of the cough and headache."
