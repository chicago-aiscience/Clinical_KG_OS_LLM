  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the key findings in the gold answer. It correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19), the test, and the workplace concerns. However, it is slightly less precise than the gold answer regarding the timing of the test relative to symptom onset, stating it was 'during' the duration rather than 'when I first started having symptoms' as specified in P-36.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main points but misses some specific details present in the gold answer: it omits the patient's specific job title ('clerk'), the detail that the patient is currently 'staying home' waiting for symptoms to resolve, and the specific link between the desire for medication and the return to work.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is fully grounded in the transcript. It uses direct quotes and correct speaker tags (e.g., [P-35], [P-17]) to support its claims without any hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses all four parts of the multi-part question without including irrelevant information."
