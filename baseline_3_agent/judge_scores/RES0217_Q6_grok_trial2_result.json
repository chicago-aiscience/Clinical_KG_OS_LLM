  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer is factually accurate overall, matching Gold on diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick to lab, blood work), prophylactic antibiotics due to >72h attachment, physician consultation, and preventive advice on garden insecticide and tick habitats. Minor discrepancies: cites [D-5] for antibiotics (D-5 discusses deer tick appearance, not duration; duration from [D-6]); interprets physical exam purpose as 'assess condition and confirm risk' (Gold specifies bite site); consultation calls it 'colleague or specialist' (transcript implies supervising physician); omits explicit geographic risk [D-13] in treatment rationale. Core facts consistent, no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: all diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick lab ID [D-6,D-18], blood serology [D-18]); prophylactic antibiotics [D-6,D-13,D-18]; physician consultation/talk to doctor [D-13,D-18,D-22]; preventive advice on long grass/woods-fields intersection and insecticide [D-18]. Missed: explicit geographic risk (Strathroy) in treatment [D-13]; tick 'waving motion with legs' description [D-18]; note that no specific antibiotic details given. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable: tick lab [D-6,D-18], blood work [D-18], physical exam [D-18], antibiotics prophylactic >72h [D-6,D-18], consult doctor [D-18,D-22], preventive habitat/insecticide [D-18]. Minor issues: [D-5] citation inaccurate for antibiotics (deer tick ID only); physical exam purpose slightly interpretive ('assess condition/confirm risk' not verbatim); 'immediately' and '(or specialist)' added (not in transcript, plausible but stretched). No major hallucinations, mostly grounded with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structured around question components (diagnostic tests lab/physical, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice on garden/outdoor), uses transcript citations, no tangents or unrelated content. Perfectly focused."
