  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the doctor's concluding remarks are not included in the transcript, despite [D-33] explicitly providing them and stating the plan to pass information to another doctor for evaluation; it covers some symptom details (sharp pain on deep breath, 20 min duration, OTC failure), smoking, family history, past anxiety, and stress but omits key elements like 1.5-week onset, rest/alone triggers, distraction relief, no exercise worsening, multiple pertinent negatives (trauma, fevers, asthma, dyspnea, palpitations, family sudden death), lives alone, and multivitamin, representing significant factual discrepancies from the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers the plan (relay to another physician) and key points in 5 categories: detailed symptoms, failed OTC, pertinent negatives, relevant history, psychosocial context; Generated misses the entire plan, partial symptoms (misses onset, full pattern, relief), no pertinent negatives, incomplete history (e.g., full smoking reduction, lives alone), partial psychosocial; covers approximately 25-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims concluding remarks absent is directly contradicted by [D-33]; accurate citations for some symptoms/smoking/family/stress/anxiety but hallucinates 'knowledge graph' references not in transcript, infers anxiety diagnosis not stated, and misrepresents anxiety symptoms as constant rather than contextual; multiple unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly attempts to address key clinical information gathered but completely sidesteps the stated plan by falsely denying source material, introduces off-topic 'knowledge graph'; partially relevant to question."
