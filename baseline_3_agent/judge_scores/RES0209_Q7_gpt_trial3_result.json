  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is partially consistent with the transcript but contains notable errors relative to the Gold Answer.\n- It correctly reports current symptoms of dry cough, shortness of breath, and wheeze (P-1, P-15).\n- It correctly mentions triggers (exercise, cold air, spring/pollen) (P-9, P-11), though it incorrectly frames these as clearly causing the *current* exacerbation rather than being general triggers.\n- It incorrectly cites/attributes chest tightness: chest tightness is confirmed at P-20, but the answer cites an unrelated “Yeah” at P-4 (which is about using bronchodilator PRN).\n- It does not accurately describe the bronchodilator frequency change with the key numeric detail (baseline once every two weeks → now 5–6 times/week) which is central to the question.\n- It introduces an extraneous claim about “[Knowledge Graph] inference,” which is not in the transcript.\nOverall, the core idea of worsening symptoms and increased bronchodilator use is correct, but there are factual/citation errors and missing key temporal/quantitative details.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered vs missed:\n- Covered: current dry cough and SOB (P-1), wheeze (P-15); mentions exercise/cold/spring triggers (P-9, P-11).\n- Missed: diagnosis timing (age 8) and current age (10) / 2-year course (P-2, D-3/P-3); baseline bronchodilator frequency “once every two weeks” (P-8); current frequency “almost every day… five six times a week” (P-8); explicit two-week duration clarification (P-13 vs initial “week or so” P-1); statement that wheezing occurs even more often than bronchodilator use (P-16, P-17); nighttime symptoms every other day/every two days (P-18); denial of infectious trigger/workup negatives (P-21–P-28).\nBecause multiple central temporal and quantitative evolution points are omitted, coverage is well below 80%.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded in the transcript (cough, SOB, wheeze, triggers, family history). However:\n- The chest tightness citation is wrong (uses P-4 rather than P-20).\n- The answer references “[Knowledge Graph] inference,” which is not present in the transcript.\n- It implies the listed triggers specifically explain the current exacerbation, which is not established in the transcript.\nThus, there are multiple ungrounded/misattributed elements, though not wholesale fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically for the *evolution over time* from diagnosis at age 8, to baseline bronchodilator use once every two weeks, to the current two-week exacerbation with near-daily use 5–6 times/week. The Generated Answer discusses current symptoms and triggers and generally states use increased, but it fails to clearly narrate the requested time course with the key ages, timeframe (two weeks), and specific bronchodilator frequencies. It is on-topic but does not directly answer the evolution requested."
