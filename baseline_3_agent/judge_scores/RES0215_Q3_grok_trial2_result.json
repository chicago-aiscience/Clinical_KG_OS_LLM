  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's diagnosis of 'Asthma (specifically exercise-induced asthma exacerbated by cold weather and allergic rhinitis)' is factually consistent with the Gold Answer's 'pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the context of an atopic predisposition,' as both identify asthma with exercise and allergy triggers. Core supporting facts like exercise triggers [P-3, P-41], cold weather [P-38], multiple settings [P-38], and seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36] match. Minor discrepancies include framing past viral history [P-15] as supportive (Gold uses current negatives to rule out infection) and adding 'allergic rhinitis' (implied but not explicit). No major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) exercise-triggered [P-3,6,41]; 2) episodic/reversible with rest [P-6,33]; 3) cold weather [P-38]; 4) multiple settings [P-38]; 5) seasonal allergies [P-35,36]; 6) nocturnal episode [P-43,44]; 7) pertinent negatives (fever [P-7], runny nose [P-8], etc.). Generated covers exercise, cold, settings, allergies (4/7 ~57%). Misses explicit reversibility citation, nocturnal episode, and negatives; adds symptoms and viral history not central to Gold.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: citations [P-1,2,3,32,35,36,38,41,15] accurate from transcript. Hallucinations include two 'knowledge graph' references (not in transcript, fabricating external validation for allergies/Reactine and wheezing/SOB/chest discomfort); 'chest discomfort' not in transcript (only SOB/wheezing/deep breaths). Viral history presented as support is plausible but stretched beyond transcript. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses diagnosis and transcript supports with bulleted list matching question. Minor off-topic additions (knowledge graph, viral history, extra symptoms) but core content focused on question without major digressions."
