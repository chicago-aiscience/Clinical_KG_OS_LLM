  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually correct and aligns with the transcript and Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the key symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat) and the specific detail about the missing flu shot leading to the influenza differential.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most of the key points but misses two specific elements mentioned in the Gold Answer: the inclusion of 'muscle aches' in the symptom cluster and the epidemiological context regarding the husband's similar symptoms, which the doctor used to specifically prioritize COVID-19 as the first thing to rule out.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, providing specific turn citations ([P-1], [D-53], [P-53], [D-54]) for every claim made. No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question with a clear structure. It stays focused on the doctor's suspicions and the vaccination history without extraneous information."
