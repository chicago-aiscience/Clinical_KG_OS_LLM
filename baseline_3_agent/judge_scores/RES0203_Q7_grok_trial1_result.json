  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the simultaneous onset of all three symptoms two days prior, matching Gold [P-1,P-2]; correctly states no worsening or fluctuation, supported by transcript for cough [P-8] and implied for sensory; correctly notes no prior history, aligning with Gold [P-3]. Minor discrepancies include lacking explicit confirmation of cough timing [D-6,P-6], sensory consistency [D-5,P-5], partial sensory details [P-4], and doctor's COVID note [D-39], but core facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: simultaneous onset of all three symptoms ~2 days prior (100%); no worsening/fluctuation for symptoms (covers via 'no evidence' and cough detail, ~90% as sensory consistency not explicit); no prior similar symptoms (100%). Misses: specific cough confirmation [D-6,P-6], sensory consistency citation [D-5,P-5], partial nature persistence [P-4], doctor's summary [D-39]. Overall ~85% coverage of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: onset from [P-1]; simultaneous inference grounded in [P-1] and confirmed [D-6,P-6]; no fluctuation from [P-8] (cough) and [P-5] (sensory); no prior explicitly denied [P-3]. No hallucinations; citations accurate where used.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by structuring response around onset timing relative to each other, fluctuation/worsening, and prior history with no off-topic content."
