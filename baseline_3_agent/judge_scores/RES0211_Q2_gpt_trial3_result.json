  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- **Claritin**: Correct that she carries Claritin “just in case” and is not actively taking it now (matches [P-25] and consistent with [P-16]).\n- **Birth control**: Correct that she takes an oral contraceptive pill, but the answer **fails to name it as “Deyo”** and omits the key detail that it is the pill that “goes for three months” ([P-26], [P-27]).\n- **Past allergist treatment (allergy shots)**: Correct that she received allergy shots for seasonal allergies, but the answer **omits the dosing/frequency detail**: “once a week for a little while, like in the winter before” ([P-20]).\n- **Dosing details statement**: The answer claims **no dosing details were mentioned**, which is **incorrect**, because weekly administration for shots and the 3‑month OCP cycle are dosing/regimen details.\n- It also omits correct/important related facts in the Gold Answer (no EpiPen; no medication allergies), but that is more a completeness issue than direct incorrectness.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered vs missed:\n- Covered:\n  - Claritin carried/not currently taking; seasonal allergy indication.\n  - Takes birth control (general).\n  - Past allergy shots (general).\n- Missed:\n  - **Medication name “Deyo.”**\n  - **Regimen detail** that the pill “goes for three months.”\n  - **Allergy shot frequency/timing**: once weekly for a while in winter before season.\n  - **Denies medication allergies.**\n  - **Does not carry an EpiPen** and the contextual detail that allergies are seasonal and not associated with facial swelling/breathing difficulty.\nOverall, it captures some medications but misses multiple specific names and regimen details the question explicitly asks for.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are grounded in the transcript (Claritin carried; birth control use; allergy shots history).\n- However, it introduces **“The knowledge graph indicates … [KG]”**, which is **not part of the provided transcript** and is therefore an ungrounded reference.\n- It also implies dosing details are absent despite transcript regimen details (weekly shots; 3‑month pill), which is not faithful to the source content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked items (current meds/carrying status and allergist treatments). However, it does not provide the specific names and dosing/regimen details requested, reducing how well it satisfies the question."
