  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and the negative test result, matching the Gold Answer. It accurately cites patient disclosure of the test [P-35] and key prompting factors like hospital work [P-17], persistent cough [P-2], initial flu-like symptoms [P-14], and coworkers' fear [P-35]. Minor discrepancies include emphasizing chest soreness [P-15] as a prompter (which is minor and post-coughing in transcript/Gold) and generalizing flu-like symptoms without specifying sore throat [P-13] or runny nose [P-14], but core facts are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: diagnosis (COVID-19), test disclosure/quote [P-35], hospital exposure [P-17/P-34], flu-like symptoms/cough persistence [P-14], coworkers scared [P-35], negative result. Partially covers occupational exposure details; misses explicit sore throat/runny nose listings, PPE use/cautiousness [P-17], precise test timing at onset [P-36], and staying home post-test [P-36]. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: persistent cough [P-2], chest soreness [P-15], flu-like history [P-14], hospital work [P-17], coworkers scared/test mention/negative [P-35]. No hallucinations; citations accurate and grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question with sections on diagnosis investigated, evidence prompting investigation, and testing results; no irrelevant content or tangents."
