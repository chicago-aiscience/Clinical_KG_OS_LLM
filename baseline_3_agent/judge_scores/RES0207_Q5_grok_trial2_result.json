  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies hereditary risk (epilepsy runs in family, mom had it [P-26], consistent with patient's chronic epilepsy [P-8]) and medication non-adherence (missed Keppra [P-23, P-24], linked to seizure [P-9], seizures infrequent otherwise). Generated covers core facts accurately with correct citations but introduces minor discrepancy by stating the recent seizure 'definitively establishes the medical history of epilepsy,' implying it confirms the diagnosis, whereas patient presents it as pre-existing chronic condition [P-8, P-22]. Core facts remain correct. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: hereditary (family epilepsy, maternal history [P-26], clinician question [D-26], consistent with diagnosis); medication (Keppra [P-23], missed due to birthday routine change [P-24], linked to seizure [P-9], infrequent seizures normally). Generated covers medication non-adherence and link [P-9, P-23], hereditary family/mom [P-26], relation to diagnosis [P-8]; misses specific reason for missing dose (birthday [P-24]), infrequency of seizures, clinician's prompt [D-26], explicit combination. Covers ~85% of key points. Score: 4.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated verifiable: Keppra [P-23], missed med link [P-9], family/mom epilepsy [P-26], patient history [P-8]. Citations accurate to transcript. Interpretation of seizure 'confirming' diagnosis is plausible from [P-8] context but slightly stretched; no fabrication. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around medication risk, hereditary risk, and family history relation to diagnosis, with transcript citations, perfectly matching question focus without tangents. Score: 5"
