  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. Most critically, it incorrectly attributes 'sore throat and cough' to P-1, which only mentions shortness of breath, fatigue, and being rundown. The actual discussion of sore throat occurs at P-9 and cough at P-7/P-8. It also misses the diminished sense of smell [P-6], the mild headaches [P-11-13], and importantly mischaracterizes several symptoms. The citation [D-36] for muscle aches is incorrect - the patient directly reported achiness at P-20/P-21, not just implied through doctor's summary.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers approximately 60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies loss of taste, sore throat (despite wrong citation), cough, weakness, generalized achiness, fever/warmth, and decreased appetite. However, it completely omits: diminished sense of smell, the specific characterization of the cough as 'dry' and 'on its way', denial of runny nose/congestion, generalized (not localized) nature of muscle aches, lack of numbness/tingling, and the nuanced discussion of headaches being likely stress-related rather than new symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major hallucination error by citing P-1 as containing 'sore throat and cough' when this exchange only discusses shortness of breath and fatigue. All other claims are verifiable in the transcript, though some citations are imprecise or incorrect. The substance is mostly grounded, but the fabricated citation to P-1 is a significant faithfulness issue that undermines trust in the response.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by identifying symptoms beyond the chief complaints, organized by the requested categories (sensory changes, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional). All content provided is relevant to answering what other specific symptoms the patient reported. No off-topic information is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's focus areas but contains critical factual errors, most notably a fabricated citation attributing sore throat and cough to P-1. It covers roughly 60% of key symptoms but omits important details like diminished smell, headache discussion, and denials of certain symptoms. While topically relevant and mostly grounded in the transcript, the citation errors and incomplete coverage significantly impact its quality as a clinical QA response."
