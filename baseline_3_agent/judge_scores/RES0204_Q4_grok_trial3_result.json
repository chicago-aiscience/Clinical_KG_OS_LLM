  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition ruled out, notes the positive family history in grandparents cited by the mother, and correctly lists the specific symptoms (shortness of breath and wheezing) that the patient does not exhibit even during physical activity, matching the Gold Answer's core facts without any errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: asthma as condition, positive family history in grandparents, specific negatives (no shortness of breath, no wheezing even during physical activity) cited by mother [P-28]. Missed: doctor's inquiry [D-28/D-30], prior 'worked up' evaluation, mother's explicit conclusion 'he doesn't have that', patient's self-reported healthy history [P-24], and emphasis on notability of exercise-induced absence. Covers core ~80-90% of Gold's points focused on question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [P-28]: grandparents' asthma history, no shortness of breath/wheezing even with physical activity. Citation [P-28] accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by naming asthma, confirming family history in grandparents, and detailing mother-cited pertinent negatives (no SOB/wheezing even during activity), with no off-topic content."
