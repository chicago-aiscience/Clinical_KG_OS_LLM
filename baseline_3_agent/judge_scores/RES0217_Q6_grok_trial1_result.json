  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the Gold Answer: diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick to lab, blood work), prophylactic antibiotics with rationale (>72 hours attachment), physician consultation, and preventive advice (garden inspection, insecticide). Minor discrepancies include slightly inaccurate citations (e.g., >72h from D-6 not D-5), generalizing physical exam purpose beyond 'bite site', not noting no specific antibiotic details, omitting 'waving motion' description of ticks, and describing consultation as possibly with a 'specialist' rather than attending physician. Core facts are correct with no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: all three diagnostics (physical exam, tick lab ID, blood serology); antibiotics recommendation with >72h rationale; physician consultation plan; preventive advice on garden/long grass/woods-fields and insecticide. Missed/minor: explicit geographic risk (Strathroy), 'waving motion' tick description, trainee-supervised context, exact phrasings like 'safer than not' or 'moving forward', note on no antibiotic specifics. Covers 80-99% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations mostly (minor offset like D-5 for >72h which is D-6). No fabrications; physical exam purpose is a plausible interpretation of context; preventive advice directly quotes locations and suggests insecticide [D-18]; antibiotics rationale grounded [D-6, D-13, D-18]. Minor unverifiable details in phrasing but fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to match the question's categories (diagnostic tests lab/physical, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice on garden/outdoor); no off-topic content, directly addresses comprehensive plan at consultation end."
