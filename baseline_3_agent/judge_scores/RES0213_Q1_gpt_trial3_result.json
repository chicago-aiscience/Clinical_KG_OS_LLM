  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer contains major inaccuracies about when the pain occurs/resolves. While it correctly states the pain is “very sharp/strong” and lasts ~20 minutes, it fails to mention the key qualifying feature that it occurs with deep inspiration (pleuritic) and misattributes occurrence to “anxiety attacks.” In the transcript, anxiety attacks are mentioned in relation to palpitations/heart flutter (P-20), not as the exclusive context for chest pain. It also incorrectly claims the pain is “exclusive to episodes of anxiety attacks,” which contradicts the patient’s description of pain occurring when walking alone or studying and improving/going unnoticed when socially engaged at school (P-9, P-29).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements missed: (1) overall course for ~1.5 weeks; (2) initial description as “uncomfortable/odd” before calling it sharp pain; (3) pain specifically with deep breath; (4) occurs particularly when alone (walking to school, studying) and is less noticeable/resolves with distraction/social interaction; (5) can occur at rest; (6) not worsened by exercise/walking; (7) no prior similar episodes and no injury/accident. The Generated Answer includes only partial points (sharp/strong quality; ~20-minute episodes; OTC meds tried—this last item is not a Gold key point for the question).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not supported and/or mis-cited: citing P-1 for pain quality is incorrect; linking pain specifically to anxiety attacks and stating it is exclusive to anxiety attacks misuses P-20 (which addresses palpitations/flutter, not chest pain). Claims about stress/anxiety as triggers are speculative at best in the transcript (patient wonders it “could be stress”), but the dominant, explicit pattern (alone vs with others) is omitted. Overall, multiple claims are ungrounded or contradict the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (quality, duration, triggers/resolution) but includes irrelevant detail (OTC medication trials) and focuses heavily on stress/anxiety rather than the transcript’s main described contexts (alone walking/studying vs distracted/social)."
