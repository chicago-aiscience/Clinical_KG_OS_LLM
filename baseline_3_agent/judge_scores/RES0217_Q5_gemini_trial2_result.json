  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the logic for the 72-hour attachment duration mentioned in segment [D-6]. However, it fails significantly on the second part of the question. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain evidence of the doctor using an 'Ontario Lyme disease distribution map' or citing Strathroy's position, whereas segment [D-13] of the transcript contains exactly that information: 'there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario... Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.'",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first half of the question regarding the 72-hour duration. It fails to provide the key points regarding the geographic risk justification because it incorrectly claims the information is missing, thereby missing roughly 50% of the required content from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucination of absence. It claims the geographic evidence is not in the provided segments, which is false. This is a failure in faithfulness to the provided source text (specifically [D-13]).",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant in that it directly attempts to answer both parts of the multi-part question, although the second part is answered incorrectly."
