  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies only denial of smell loss as a negative finding, ignoring the Gold Answer's comprehensive list of denied symptoms (cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell, fever, chills/night sweats) and other negatives (prior breathing difficulty, sick contacts, travel); it mischaracterizes positive symptoms like sore throat and breathing issues as 'screened for' negatives per a non-existent knowledge graph, and fabricates differential inferences (e.g., absence of anosmia distinguishing from 'classic' COVID, despite anosmia being supportive of COVID), leading to significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points include 7 specific denied symptoms with citations (cough [D-15/P-15], runny nose [D-16/P-16], headaches [D-17/P-17], chest pain [D-18/P-18], loss of smell [D-19/P-19], fever [D-23/P-23], chills/night sweats [D-24/P-24]), 3 additional denies (prior breathing [D-11/P-11], contacts [D-12/P-12], travel [D-13/P-13]), and nuanced differential discussion (no explicit differentials, inferences like excluding URI, relevance to dyspnea/COVID); Generated covers only 1 symptom (smell loss, partially) and superficial mono mention, missing 95%+ of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Some claims grounded (e.g., quotes [P-19] denying smell, [D-43] COVID suspicion, [P-5] mono history); however, repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' and fabricated links (e.g., '[SYMPTOM] smell loss --[INDICATES]--> [DIAGNOSIS] covid', mono not linked to smell loss) not present in transcript, lists admitted symptoms (sore throat, etc.) as screened negatives, introducing multiple hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Attempts to address both parts of question by listing (incomplete) negative findings and discussing distinctions (COVID, mono), but derailed by irrelevant knowledge graph fabrications and narrow focus on one symptom, resulting in partial relevance with off-topic content."
