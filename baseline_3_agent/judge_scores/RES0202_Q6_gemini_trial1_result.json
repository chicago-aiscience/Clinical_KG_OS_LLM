  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab, the 24-48 hour window, the 14-day isolation including the sister, the possibility of false negatives, the alternative of another viral illness, and the specific emergency warning signs (fever, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points from the gold answer. However, it omits the doctor's mention of asthma as a differential diagnosis if the patient had not presented with a fever, which the gold answer includes as part of the complete assessment context. It also misses the concluding remark about watchful waiting and the lack of prescribed medication.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, correctly citing the relevant speaker turns (D-44, D-45) for each clinical instruction and assessment detail.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses all specific components of the user's question, focusing on the assessment, management, testing, isolation, and warning signs."
