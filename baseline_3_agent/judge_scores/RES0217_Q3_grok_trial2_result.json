  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer specifies four key elements: (1) exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertain timing [P-1]); (2) tick attachment >72 hours [D-6]; (3) geographic risk (Strathroy creek [P-12], Ontario map shows concerning [D-13]); (4) prior tick bite with bullseye rash ~10 years ago requiring antibiotics [P-3]. Generated covers duration fully and accurately, prior history accurately, exposure history under duration and geo points, but geographic risk is generalized to activities/habitats [D-18] without mentioning Strathroy or map consultation. Adds 'current localized symptoms' as a key factor, which is factual from transcript [P-1,P-6] but not emphasized in Gold as a primary driver. Mentions overriding no deer tick/no rash correctly. Minor discrepancies in emphasis and omission of specific geo details, but core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: exposure history (hiking Fri/Sat, uncertain [P-1]) - partially covered; duration >72h [D-6] - fully; geo risk (Strathroy/map [P-12,D-13]) - partially (activities/habitats, misses specifics); prior history [P-3] - fully; despite factors (not deer tick [P-5], no rash [P-6], all ticks concern [P-5], lab [D-6,D-18]) - mostly (overriding mentioned, lab implied). Covers ~85% (strong on duration/prior/exposure, weak on precise geo).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: duration [D-6], prior [P-3], symptoms [P-1,P-6], habitats [D-18], activities [P-1]. Citations accurate except fabricated 'knowledge graph [KG: hiking, gardening]' not in transcript (hallucination, though content plausible from context). No major fabrications beyond this; grounded overall but minor unverifiable citation.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing combination of risk factors (duration, geo, prior, symptoms) overriding no deer tick/no rash; structured to match query's elements (exposure via activities, duration, geo, prior). Minor tangent with symptoms and KG, but focused on doctor's recommendation rationale."
