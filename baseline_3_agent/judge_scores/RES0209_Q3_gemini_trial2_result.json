  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness) and the medication escalation. However, it contains significant citation errors: it attributes the confirmation of chest tightness to [P-4] and [P-9] (instead of [P-20]) and the medication frequency details to [P-9] (instead of [P-8]). It also references a 'knowledge graph' that was not provided in the prompt or transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a crucial part of the Gold Answer: the exclusion of 'new respiratory conditions' (like infections) through negative screens for fever, travel, sick contacts, and productive cough. It focuses only on why it is asthma, whereas the Gold Answer explains why it is asthma and NOT something else.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph'. Furthermore, several citations within the transcript [P-4, P-9] are mapped to the wrong dialogue exchanges regarding symptoms and frequency.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question as it discusses the symptoms and bronchodilator use, though it doesn't fully address the comparative aspect (asthma vs. new condition) as thoroughly as the Gold Answer."
