  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies 'acute bronchitis' as the primary diagnosis, which aligns with the gold answer's diagnosis of an acute lower respiratory tract infection. It correctly attributes the symptoms to the patient's report, though it lacks the clinical nuance of the gold answer regarding the potential for bacterial superinfection or pneumonia.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the three main clinical features (cough, sputum color, and fever) but fails to explain the 'how' with the same depth as the gold answer. Specifically, it misses the explanation that the greenish color suggests an infectious/bacterial etiology and that the 3-day acute change signifies a transition from irritation to inflammation. It also omits the synthesis of the doctor's summary mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' twice, claiming it 'explicitly establishes the relationship' or 'links symptoms.' No such graph exists in the provided source transcript. The symptom citations themselves are accurate to the transcript, but the attribution of logic to an external tool is a hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question asked, addressing the diagnosis and the contributing features without off-topic content."
