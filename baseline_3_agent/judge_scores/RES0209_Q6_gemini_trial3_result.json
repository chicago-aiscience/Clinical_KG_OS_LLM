  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test and the consultation with the physician. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly suggest a change in the medication regimen. The clinician explicitly states in [D-43], 'maybe all you need is a little change to your medications', which qualifies as the suggestion requested by the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main components requested: the COVID-19 test, the consultation, and the medication adjustment. It misses minor details included in the Gold Answer, such as the specific goal regarding the patient's ability to play sports without medication [D-42] and the plan for the clinician to return to the room with the supervising physician [D-43, D-44].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript, providing specific turn citations [D-29, P-1, P-15]. It does not hallucinate information outside of the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing each part of the multi-part question without unnecessary filler."
