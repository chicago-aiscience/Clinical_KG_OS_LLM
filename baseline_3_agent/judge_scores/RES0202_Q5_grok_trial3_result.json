  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes mother's explicit concern about COVID from school [P-2], precise distinction of no known sick contacts outside school but 'kinda hard to say' at school [P-38], school not contacting [P-39], school test requirement [P-41], and supporting no travel/env factors. Generated correctly notes timeline suggesting school source [P-1] and no reported notification, but inaccurately lumps sick contacts as none specific 'at school or outside' without distinction, uses wrong citations [P-1 instead of P-38/39], omits mother's COVID-school link [P-2], and adds unemphasized doctor COVID/asthma comments; some factual errors but core school suspicion and no known contacts/outside contacts correct.",
    "completeness": "Covers: timeline linking symptoms to school (partial for [P-1]/[P-2]), suspected school source, no specific sick contacts (broadly covers [P-38] but misses vs. outside distinction and 'hard to say' at school), no school notification (covers [P-39]). Misses: explicit COVID-school concern [P-2], school test requirement [P-41], no travel [P-40], no environmental exposures [P-37]; covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Timeline/temp [P-1] verifiable; doctor COVID [D-44] verifiable; no specific contacts inferred from [P-1/P-38] but wrong cite [P-1]; school notif cite wrong [P-1 vs P-39]; 'knowledge graph' and asthma/viral phrasing not directly in transcript (doctor mentions viral [D-44] and asthma if no fever [D-45], plausible but added detail); mostly grounded with minor unverifiable additions and citation errors.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around school attendance/source, sick contacts, school notification, matching question; minor tangents like asthma and 'knowledge graph' but overall focused."
