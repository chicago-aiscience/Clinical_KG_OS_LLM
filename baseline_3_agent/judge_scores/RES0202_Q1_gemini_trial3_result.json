{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it states the mother noted the boy had a 'big appetite right now' [P-15], whereas the transcript [P-15] explicitly states 'he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now.' It also misses the reported 'runny nose.'",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is highly incomplete. The question specifically asked for symptoms such as wheezing, sore throat, and chills, all of which were denied in the transcript and included in the Gold Answer, but were omitted in the generated response. It only addressed chest pain and GI complaints among the negative findings requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim regarding the boy's 'big appetite' is a direct contradiction of the source text [P-15]. Additionally, while it correctly identifies other symptoms, it fails to capture the full scope of the dialogue provided.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure but fails to provide the specific details requested in the prompt's parenthetical examples (wheezing, sore throat, chills)."
