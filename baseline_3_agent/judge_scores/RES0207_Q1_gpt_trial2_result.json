{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the patient’s reported respiratory symptoms (sudden shortness of breath and dry cough), the neurological symptom (seizure the previous night), and the objective fever measurement (37.4°C). These statements are consistent with the transcript and align with the Gold Answer. No factual contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "For the question asked, the key required items are: (1) shortness of breath, (2) cough (dry), (3) seizure, and (4) measured temperature value. The generated answer includes all of these. However, compared with the Gold Answer’s fuller specification, it omits additional descriptive details that further characterize the presentation (e.g., symptoms started that morning/~3 hours prior; cough began suddenly that morning; underlying epilepsy; temperature explicitly checked that morning and described as mild).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript citations: shortness of breath [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure last night [P-8], and temperature 37.4°C [P-5]. No extra, unverifiable, or hallucinated details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what was asked: respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and the objective fever measurement. No irrelevant content is added."
