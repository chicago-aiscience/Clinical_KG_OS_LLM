  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma (specifically exercise-induced and cold-exacerbated). The supporting facts regarding triggers (exercise, cold), settings, and allergic history are all consistent with the Gold Answer and the clinical evidence provided in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer captures several key points: exercise triggers, cold weather, multiple settings, and seasonal allergies. However, it misses three significant pillars included in the Gold Answer: 1) The episodic/reversible nature of the symptoms (resolving with rest), 2) The nocturnal wheezing episode, and 3) The pertinent negatives (absence of fever, phlegm, etc.) which help rule out infection. It covers approximately 57% of the specific supporting points used in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly verifiable in the transcript. However, the Generated Answer repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' to support its claims; this knowledge graph is not part of the provided transcript. While the clinical associations mentioned are correct, attributing them to an external 'knowledge graph' instead of the transcript itself is a minor deviation from the instructions to use 'specific findings from the transcript'.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the diagnosis and the supporting evidence as requested in the prompt."
