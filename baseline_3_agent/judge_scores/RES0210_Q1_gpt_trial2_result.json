  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies that the patient had a bad cough, reported right-sided chest pain, and had systemic symptoms of subjective fever/feeling off and chills (supported by P-1, P-5, P-9, P-17). However, it is factually incomplete/inaccurate regarding sputum: the transcript describes sputum as “yellow custard” with “little spots of red” (blood-tinged), whereas the generated answer only describes “red…gunk” and omits the yellow custard appearance (P-6). It also misstates the “raw” symptom as the chest feeling raw rather than the throat feeling raw after lots of coughing (P-15). It does not describe the chest pain quality (dull, constant) or pleuritic worsening with deep breaths/coughing, which are key specifics asked for (P-18 to P-21).",
    "completeness": "Key gold points covered: cough present/worsening in general; presence of blood-tinged sputum (spots of red); right-sided chest pain location; subjective fever/feeling off; chills.\nKey points missed: sputum’s primary color/appearance (“yellow custard”) and that red spots appeared with it; chest pain quality (dull), persistence/constant nature (present even lying down), and worsening with cough and deep breathing; duration/onset timing detail (raspy Friday, worse Sunday); mild dyspnea on exertion; resolved runny nose; negative weight loss. Overall, the response captures only a minority of the specific descriptive elements requested.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are anchored to the transcript with appropriate citations (P-1, P-4, P-5, P-9, P-17). The main faithfulness issue is the mischaracterization of the ‘raw’ symptom as chest rawness rather than throat rawness (P-15) and the incomplete/biased depiction of sputum as primarily red rather than yellow with red spots (P-6). No clear fabricated symptoms beyond these misinterpretations.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the patient’s reported symptoms (sputum, chest pain, systemic symptoms, cough). It does not introduce irrelevant information."
