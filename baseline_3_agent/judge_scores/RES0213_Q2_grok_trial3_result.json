  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC medications for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and their ineffectiveness, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-6]. However, it incorrectly states there is 'no indication' of any routine OTC supplements, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript where the patient reports taking a daily multivitamin [P-25]. This is a significant factual error regarding routine supplements.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer for pain [P-6]; (2) all ineffective [P-6]; (3) daily multivitamin as routine supplement [P-25]; (4) no prescription meds [D-25,P-25]; (5) stress management (reading, running) [P-28]; (6) trying to quit smoking [P-13,P-14,P-18]. Generated covers (1) and (2) fully (~50%), misses (3)-(6), including the core routine supplement.",
    "faithfulness": "Pain medications and ineffectiveness quote are verifiable in [P-6]. However, claim of 'no indication' of routine supplements is not grounded, as [P-25] explicitly states 'I take like a multi vitamin but that's it'; this is a hallucinated negation. Additional mention of 'knowledge graph provided' is unverifiable and not in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured to directly address OTC meds/supplements for pain, routine, and effectiveness, with clear sections matching the question; minor irrelevant reference to knowledge graph does not detract significantly."
