  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain explicit patient denials for symptoms like fever, dyspnea, or sore throat, despite clear evidence in [D-10/P-10] no fevers, [D-11/P-11] no difficulty breathing, [D-13/P-13] no sore throat, and others up to [D-15/P-15]. It fails to list any of the Gold Answer's pertinent negatives (e.g., no headaches, no chills, no muscle aches, no chest pain, no sputum/blood, no cough triggers) and misidentifies immunizations [D-20/P-20] and family history [D-27/P-27] as key screenings for absent symptoms, which they are not part of the ROS negatives. It contradicts the Gold by focusing on positive symptoms and hallucinating a 'knowledge graph'. Major factual errors throughout.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: lists 9 specific ROS negatives with citations (fever, dyspnea, headaches, sore throat, chills/night sweats, muscle aches/weakness, chest pain, sputum/blood, cough triggers), D-16 summary quote, explanation of how absences indicate not acutely unwell/generally well, plus PMH negatives (chronic conditions, meds, surgeries, allergies, family hx). Generated covers 0% of these; instead discusses positives (anosmia, ageusia, dry cough) and irrelevant screenings (immunizations, family hx).",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple hallucinations: references non-existent 'knowledge graph' and symptom links to nose/tongue; falsely claims no explicit denials for fever/dyspnea/sore throat when transcript has verbatim 'No' responses [D-10 to D-15, D-22]; misrepresents [D-39] as relying on absence rather than explicit history; immunizations/family hx responses are present and negative (P-20 'Yes' up to date, P-27 'No'), but not framed as ROS negatives. Not grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for specific absent symptoms/conditions screened (negative ROS findings like fever, dyspnea, sore throat) and how their absence informed clinical picture. Generated ignores negatives entirely, pivots to positive symptoms (smell/taste loss, cough), irrelevant screenings (immunizations, family hx), and COVID suspicion based on positives, not addressing absences or their role in portraying patient as 'generally well' per [D-16]. Largely off-topic."
