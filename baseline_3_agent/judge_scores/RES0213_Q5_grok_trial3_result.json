  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: incorrectly refers to the patient as 'he/his' multiple times despite the question and Gold Answer using 'her' (contradicting contextual evidence like Masters in social work); omits key details like father's heart attack being 'last year' and now seeing 'a lot of heart doctors' [P-8, P-30]; misses paternal grandfather's death in accident [P-30]; inaccurately frames smoking as a 'direct physiological risk factor for the chest pain' rather than a personal concern; introduces unsubstantiated causations. Core structure matches but errors undermine accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Covers: family history (father's HA in 50s scaring patient [P-8]); smoking (5 cigs/day, trying to quit [P-13,14]); stressors (thesis pressure [P-15,16], possible stress cause [P-8]); basic interactions. Misses from Gold: 'last year' timing, father sees heart doctors, grandpa accident [P-30]; full smoking history (started 18, peaked 10/day 2 yrs [P-18]); additional stressors (lives alone [P-26,27], nervous about running [P-28]); nervousness/rapid breathing [P-19]; past anxiety attacks [P-22]. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple hallucinations: entire 'Knowledge Graph' references (e.g., [FAMILY_HISTORY], [RISK_FACTOR], causal links like 'smoke --> chest pain', 'final thesis --> stress --> chest pain') not in transcript; assumes male patient; attributes smoking as causing 'biological vulnerability to symptoms' not verifiable (patient worries about heart, doesn't link directly to her pain); transcript supports concerns but not these fabricated graphs/causations. Citations accurate but content not fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three factors (family, smoking, stressors) and their interactions with concern about heart disease, using transcript details and citations; minor off-topic tangents via hallucinated Knowledge Graph, but overall focused on question."
