  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key stated reasons for each test: (1) chest X-ray because the cough persisted and the clinician wanted to “get a better look at what’s going on” [D-37], and (2) COVID swab because the clinician stated they test “anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately” [D-39]. It does not contradict the Gold Answer on these points. Minor issues: it adds generalized statements (e.g., X-ray targets lungs/chest) that are not part of the Gold Answer’s reasoning, but these are not factually wrong.",
    "completeness": "It captures the main positives (persistent dry cough; clear runny nose) and the explicit protocol reason for COVID testing. However, it omits many key Gold Answer elements about the *combination of present and absent findings*: the documented pertinent negatives (no sore throat, no fever/chills, normal taste/smell, no chest pain, no myalgias, etc.), lack of sick contacts/travel, and the Gold Answer’s added context that novelty/persistence despite absent high-acuity markers supported imaging. Overall, it covers the core rationale but misses substantial supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "Several components are not grounded in the transcript: repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and the bracketed graph triples (e.g., chest X-ray LOCATED_AT lungs; COVID swab LOCATED_AT nose) are not in the transcript. While broadly plausible, they are not transcript-supported. The rest (persistent cough, clear nasal discharge, protocol-based COVID swab) is supported. This results in partial hallucination/unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on explaining why a chest X-ray and COVID swab were ordered and links this to symptoms and clinician statements. The “knowledge graph” digression is mildly distracting but still related to the procedures."
