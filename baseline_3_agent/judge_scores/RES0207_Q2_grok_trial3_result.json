  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient is prescribed Keppra for epilepsy, matching [P-23] and the Gold Answer's reference to [P-23, P-8]. It also correctly notes that the patient forgot to take their medication, consistent with [P-9] and the Gold Answer. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Keppra for chronic epilepsy [P-23, P-8]; 2) forgot medication [P-9]; 3) specific circumstance: daughter's birthday celebration, change in dinner routine (celebration earlier, no usual dinner, completely forgot) [P-24]; 4) doctor's acknowledgment of common lapse and confirmation of isolated incident [D-24, D-25, P-24]; 5) link to seizure [P-9]. Generated covers 1 and 2 fully but misses 3-5, covering approximately 40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript: Keppra prescribed [P-23], epilepsy history [P-8, P-22], forgot dose [P-9]. Citations are accurate ([P-23], [P-9]). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question (medication for chronic condition and circumstance for missed dose) with focused content and appropriate citations, containing no irrelevant or off-topic information."
