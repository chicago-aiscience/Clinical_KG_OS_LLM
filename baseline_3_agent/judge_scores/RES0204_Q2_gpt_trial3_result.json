  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two proposed diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) and accurately states the rationale for the COVID swab as routine testing for anyone presenting with these symptoms (per D-39). No substantive clinical inaccuracies compared with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "For the specific question asked, it includes both proposed diagnostics and the key rationale for the COVID swab (institutional/standard protocol for symptomatic patients). It does not mention ancillary details from the Gold Answer (swab discomfort, reassurance, arranging tests/return with supervising doctor), but those are not strictly required to answer the question as posed.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all claims are directly supported by the transcript (D-37, D-39). However, the statement about the decision being “noted in the knowledge graph” is not present in the transcript and is an extraneous, unverifiable detail, slightly reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the diagnostic procedures proposed and the rationale for the COVID swab, directly addressing the question without meaningful tangents."
