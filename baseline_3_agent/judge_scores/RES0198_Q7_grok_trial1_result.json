  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the onset as one week prior [P-1, P-2 matching Gold], the initial symptom as stuffy nose [P-3 matching Gold], and the shift to predominantly runny nose [P-3 matching Gold]. However, it inaccurately portrays the symptoms as intermittent based solely on P-1 ('on and off'), omitting the patient's direct clarification in response to D-8 that symptoms were 'pretty constant for the past week' [P-8, emphasized in Gold as suggesting continuous persistence]. It also misses the Gold's mention of possible decongestant influence [P-10] and lack of improvement [P-1], introducing some factual discrepancies relative to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: onset one week ago (yes), initial stuffy nose (yes), shift to mostly running/rhinorrhea (yes). Key points missed: decongestant use and its partial effect [P-10], initial 'on and off' description nuanced by later 'pretty constant' clarification [P-1 vs P-8], suggestion of continuous persistence despite fluctuations, and symptoms not improving [P-1]. Covers approximately 50-60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: one week onset and 'on and off' from [P-1]; stuffy first then 'mostly running' from [P-3]. No hallucinated facts; interpretations are plausible and grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the question's requirements—chronological progression, first symptom, predominant symptom change, and constant/intermittent nature—with a clear structure and no irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core symptom onset, sequence, and progression but falls short on completeness and correctness by oversimplifying the constant vs. intermittent pattern and omitting secondary details like decongestant use."
