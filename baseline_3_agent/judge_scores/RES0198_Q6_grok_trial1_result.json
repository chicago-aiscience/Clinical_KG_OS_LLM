  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript: diagnosis as viral infection like common cold (exact match), supportive care (hydration and OTC like Tylenol Cold, exact), diagnostic swab for COVID with 48-hour results (matches, minor omission of 'today' but not erroneous), public health isolation until results (matches closely). No contradictions or errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnosis (100%), supportive care both items (100%), diagnostic test details (covers swab, COVID context, 48h; misses explicit 'today' and 'done for you today'), public health (covers isolation and avoid others until results; misses 'further instructions from public health' and expectations of 'few weeks'/'not much beyond supportive'). Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-39]: diagnosis phrasing matches, hydration and Tylenol Cold quoted accurately, swab for COVID due to pandemic symptoms, 48h results, isolation until results. No unverifiable or hallucinated content; citations correct.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's elements (diagnosis, supportive care specifics, diagnostic test, public health guidance) with no off-topic content or tangents."
