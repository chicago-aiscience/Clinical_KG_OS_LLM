{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the clinical plan mentioned in the transcript and summarized in the gold answer. It correctly identifies the diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick identification, blood work), the antibiotic treatment plan, the consultation with the attending physician, and the preventive garden advice.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers almost all key points. It identifies the 72-hour threshold for antibiotics but omits the specific mention of the 'Strathroy' geographic risk factor. It also omits the 'waving motion' description of ticks in the preventive advice section, though it captures the core advice regarding long grass and insecticide.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. The citations provided are generally accurate, although [D-5] is cited for antibiotics/species ID whereas [D-6] and [D-18] are the more direct sources for the specific plan; however, the content remains faithful to the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured exactly according to the components requested in the question (diagnostic tests, treatments, consultation, and preventive advice)."
