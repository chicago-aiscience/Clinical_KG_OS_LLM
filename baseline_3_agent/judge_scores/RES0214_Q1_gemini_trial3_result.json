  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) and the five specific symptoms denied (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing). However, it falters in the explanation of the 'denied' symptoms. It suggests these were denied because they were not mentioned in the patient's initial report (P-1, P-13) and claims the patient 'implied' a lack of symptoms rather than explicitly denying them. This contradicts the gold answer and the transcript, which show direct 'No' responses to the doctor's questions.",
    "completeness": "The answer is complete in terms of listing all the symptoms requested by the prompt (4 reported, 5 specific denials).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant hallucination regarding the dialogue. It states that when asked about neck stiffness (D-7), the patient 'began reporting her own history without answering that specific inquiry, implying a lack of that symptom.' In reality, the transcript (P-7) shows the patient answered with a direct 'No.' This is a factual fabrication of the patient's behavior during the consultation.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the question, providing clear sections for reported and denied symptoms."
