  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis the doctor wanted to exclude, correctly states the ordered test was a COVID swab, and correctly reports the expected turnaround time as 24–48 hours—all consistent with [D-52] and the Gold Answer. No factual inaccuracies are present.",
    "completeness": "The question asks for (1) the alternative diagnosis to exclude, (2) the specific diagnostic test ordered, and (3) the expected turnaround time. The Generated Answer includes all three elements exactly as in the Gold Answer/transcript. While it does not elaborate on which symptoms overlapped, that detail is not required by the question, and the Gold Answer notes the doctor did not specify them anyway.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically [D-52]. There are no added or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The response is fully focused on the three requested items and contains no tangential or irrelevant content."
