  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the cough and its progression. However, it labels the chest discomfort as 'Chest Pain' without the Gold Answer's nuance that the patient denied independent chest pain and only reported soreness resulting from coughing. All other facts align with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the resolved sore throat and runny nose, which were explicitly requested as symptoms that have since resolved. It also lacks characterization details like frequency (3-4 times per hour), lack of triggers, and all pertinent negatives (fever, difficulty breathing) that the Gold Answer includes.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript and use appropriate citations. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the question about resolved and current symptoms without including extraneous information."
