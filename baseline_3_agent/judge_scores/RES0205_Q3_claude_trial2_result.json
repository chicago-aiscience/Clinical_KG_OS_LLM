  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately states the test was negative. It correctly cites key evidence including the persistent cough, hospital work setting, and coworker concerns. The answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer's core information.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer including: the COVID-19 diagnosis, hospital employment, persistent cough, flu-like symptoms, coworker concerns, and negative test result. However, it omits some specific details present in the Gold Answer such as: the patient's specific role as a 'clerk', the exact timing of the test ('approximately two weeks ago at symptom onset'), the patient staying home since testing, PPE use being mentioned as careful practice, and the specific mention of sore throat and runny nose as initial symptoms. Coverage is approximately 75-80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations are accurate ([P-2], [P-15], [P-14], [P-17], [P-35]). The answer does not fabricate information and remains grounded in what the patient and doctor discussed. The inference about COVID-19 being investigated is reasonable given the patient's explicit mention of having 'had the covid test' [P-35].",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated (COVID-19), what evidence prompted it (hospital work, persistent cough, coworker concerns, flu-like symptoms), and what testing revealed (negative result). The response is well-focused with no irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-grounded response that correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis with appropriate supporting evidence and test results. It demonstrates strong correctness, faithfulness, and relevance with proper citation of the transcript. The completeness score is slightly lower due to omission of some specific details present in the Gold Answer (patient's clerk role, exact test timing, staying home post-test, PPE usage details), though all major points are covered."
