  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all key clinical facts: the tests (chest X-ray, COVID swab), the physical exam, the self-isolation instructions (staying away from everyone/wife), the timeline (24-48 hours), and the criteria for admission (based on results). It matches the Gold Answer's factual content perfectly.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses every component of the multi-part question: diagnostic tests, physical examination, isolation instructions, source of instructions (Doctor and Public Health Nurse), timeline, and admission criteria. It covers 100% of the key points in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript. However, there is a minor citation error: the Generated Answer attributes the chest X-ray and physical exam mention to turn [D-36], but these are actually first mentioned by the doctor in turn [D-37]. Turn [D-36] only mentions the inability to rule out COVID.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, structured clearly according to the specific sub-questions asked in the prompt, and contains no irrelevant information."
