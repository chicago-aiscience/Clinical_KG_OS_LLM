  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) from the transcript. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating the doctor did not explicitly screen for fever, joint pain, or headaches. The transcript clearly shows: D-7 asks about joint pain (P-7 denies), D-8 asks about feeling ill/feverish (P-8 denies), and D-19/D-20 ask about headaches (P-19/P-20 deny). This directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the local symptoms comprehensively with appropriate citations. However, it fails to address a major component of the question - the systemic symptoms screening. It incorrectly claims this information is not in the transcript, when in fact it is present and documented in the Gold Answer. This represents a significant omission of approximately 40-50% of the required content.",
    "faithfulness": "The local symptoms section is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, the statement 'Since the transcript does not contain evidence that the doctor screened for fever, joint pain, or headaches' is demonstrably false - this information exists in exchanges D-7/P-7, D-8/P-8, and D-19-D-20/P-19-P-20. This represents a failure to accurately represent what is in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the first part of the question about local symptoms. However, it fails to properly address the second part about systemic symptoms, instead incorrectly claiming the information is unavailable. While the response is structured to address both parts of the question, the second part contains a fundamental error that makes it non-responsive to what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately documents local symptoms with proper citations but contains a critical error in claiming the transcript lacks information about systemic symptom screening. The doctor clearly screened for joint pain (D-7/P-7), fever/feeling ill (D-8/P-8), and headaches (D-19-D-20/P-19-P-20), with the patient denying all. This significant omission and misrepresentation of available information substantially reduces the answer's correctness, completeness, and faithfulness scores."
