  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three medications used for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and accurately describes their ineffectiveness. However, it incorrectly states that there is no indication of routine supplements, directly contradicting the patient's statement in P-25 regarding taking a multivitamin.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the medications used for chest pain and their efficacy. It fails to include the multivitamin reported as a routine supplement. It also omits the additional context provided in the Gold Answer regarding stress management and smoking cessation efforts, though these were secondary to the main question about medications.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a negative hallucination by claiming there is 'no indication' of routine supplements when the transcript explicitly mentions a multivitamin in response to a direct question about medications (P-25).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, focusing strictly on the medications and supplements mentioned in the prompt without unnecessary filler, despite the factual omission."
