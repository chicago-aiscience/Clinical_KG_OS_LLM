  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the same core triad as the Gold Answer: (1) dry cough worsening over ~3 days, (2) measured fever >100°F with specific values ~100.1–101°F, and (3) possible loss of taste. It correctly explains the doctor’s reasoning that the constellation is consistent with COVID-19 (D-44) and that the presence of fever pushes the differential toward an infectious process rather than non-infectious causes like asthma (D-45). No clinically meaningful contradictions with the Gold Answer are present; only a minor transcription/wording issue (“are allowed with symptoms of covid”) that does not change meaning.",
    "completeness": "Covers essentially all Gold Answer key points: dry cough course, specific fever range, taste change, explicit alignment with COVID-19 prompting testing/isolation, and the doctor’s use of fever to favor infection over asthma/other non-infectious etiologies. It also appropriately mentions systemic features (appetite loss) consistent with the Gold Answer’s supporting rationale. No key elements are missing.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are supported by the transcript: cough details (P-1, P-5), fever values (P-1, P-2), taste concern (P-17), COVID-alignment statement and testing/isolation plan (D-44), and fever-based reasoning vs asthma if no fever (D-45). It does not introduce unsupported diagnoses or events. Minor paraphrasing is faithful to the transcript’s meaning.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by naming the specific symptom combination (respiratory complaint, measured temperature, taste change) and explaining how the doctor used these collectively to conclude a likely infectious process (and why asthma was less likely given fever). No meaningful tangents."
