  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's claims are all factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: sputum with 'little spots of red' from P-4 matches Gold's blood-tinged description; right-sided chest pain from P-17 matches; fever and feeling 'off' from P-5 aligns with subjective fevers; chills from P-9 matches exactly; cough description from P-1 and sore throat from P-15 are correct and present in Gold. No contradictions or errors, though incomplete. Score: 5",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) cough timeline (Fri raspy, Sun severe) - missed; (2) sputum 'yellow custard' with red spots simultaneous Sun - partial (only red spots, misses yellow custard); (3) right chest pain constant, dull, worse cough/deep breath, present lying down - partial (only location); (4) fevers start Mon, subjective 'felt hot', no temp measured, persists - partial (only fever/'off'); (5) chills last 2 days - full; (6) mild dyspnea on exertion (winded stairs) - missed; (7) sore/raw throat after coughing - full; (8) runny nose week ago resolved - missed; (9) no weight loss - missed. Covers ~40% (2 full + 3 partial out of 9). Score: 2",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: P-4 for red gunk/spots, P-17 for right pain, P-5 for fever/off, P-9 for chills, P-1 for bad cough, P-15 for raw throat after coughing. No hallucinated facts, minor unverifiable details, or fabrications. Score: 5",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists patient-reported symptoms in bullet points categorized by sputum, chest pain, systemic symptoms, and cough, precisely addressing the question's focus on specific symptoms including sputum description, chest pain location/quality, and systemic fever/chills. No off-topic content or tangents. Score: 5"
