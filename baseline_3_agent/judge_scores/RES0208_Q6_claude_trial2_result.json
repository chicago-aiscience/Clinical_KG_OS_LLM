  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. All key facts are correctly stated: chest X-ray and COVID swab ordered, physical examination of chest planned, self-isolation instructions including staying away from wife, 24-48 hour timeline for results, and decision criteria based on test results. The minor difference is that the Generated Answer mentions 'Public Health Nurse' will provide instructions if positive, which is directly from [D-37] and matches the Gold Answer.",

The answer covers approximately 95% of the key points from the Gold Answer, missing only the minor detail about 'no specific numerical thresholds' for admission criteria.",
