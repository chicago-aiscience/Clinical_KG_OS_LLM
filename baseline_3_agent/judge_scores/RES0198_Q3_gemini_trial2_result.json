  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the core symptoms and the doctor's conclusion from the transcript. However, it mentions a 'Knowledge Graph' that was not part of the provided context. It also focuses on the 'on and off' description of symptoms from [P-1] while the transcript later clarifies the symptoms have been 'pretty constant' [P-8].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to address several key components of the prompt. It does not provide evidence distinguishing the infection from allergic or bacterial causes (e.g., absence of fever, clear discharge, lack of allergy history, or exposure to environmental triggers). It also omits the exposure history involving the nephew in daycare and the significance of 'absent features' like cough and sore throat which were explicitly requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is generally grounded in the transcript, but the reference to a 'Knowledge Graph' is a hallucination of an external source not present in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant as it addresses the viral diagnosis but ignores the prompt's specific requirement to explain why the evidence pointed away from allergic or bacterial causes."
