  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states the doctor's only action was 'to inquire about the status of the family's air filters,' completely missing the three-step plan explicitly stated in [D-58]: physical exam, consultation with physician, and discussion of next steps. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these three components. The environmental factors listed are partially correct but incomplete—missing smoking status, pets, and wood-burning fireplaces/stoves that were explicitly assessed.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40% of the key points. It identifies some environmental factors (air filters, carpets, backyard, weather) but misses critical elements: the three-step immediate plan (physical exam, physician consultation, return discussion), the offer for questions, smoking status assessment, pet inquiry, and wood-burning fireplace/stove assessment. The most significant omission is the complete mischaracterization of the doctor's stated plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination in stating the doctor's 'only stated action was to inquire about the status of the family's air filters.' This directly contradicts [D-58] where the doctor clearly outlines three distinct next steps. The environmental factors mentioned are grounded in the transcript, but the core claim about the plan is fabricated/misinterpreted. The answer also references a 'knowledge graph' not present in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address both parts of the question (doctor's plan and environmental factors) but provides incorrect information for the primary component (the plan). The environmental factors section is partially relevant but incomplete. The answer stays on topic but fails to accurately address what was actually asked about the doctor's stated plan."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer significantly mischaracterizes the doctor's stated plan by claiming the only action was to inquire about air filters, when [D-58] explicitly outlines a three-step plan: physical examination, physician consultation, and discussion of next steps. While it identifies some environmental factors assessed (air filters, carpets, weather, backyard), it omits several others explicitly mentioned in the transcript (smoking, pets, wood-burning fireplaces/stoves). The answer contains a major factual error regarding the core question and covers less than half of the key points from the Gold Answer."
