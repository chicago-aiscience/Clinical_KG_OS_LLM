    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the key clinical details provided in the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the doctor's plan to review the case with other doctors, the summary of symptoms (nighttime coughing, greenish sputum, duration, lack of constitutional symptoms), and the source of information for next steps (the patient's history/story).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but omits a few minor details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific three-month duration (using 'some time' instead), the absence of blood in the sputum, and the context that the speaker is likely a medical trainee. However, it addresses all parts of the multi-part question effectively.",

    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the question exactly, providing distinct sections for the plan, assessment, and next steps."
