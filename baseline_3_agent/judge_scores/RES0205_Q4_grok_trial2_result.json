  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and the COVID test [P-35] as negative. Timing is partially accurate, noting the cough's two-week duration [P-2] and test during this period [P-35], but misses the Gold's precise detail of testing at symptom onset two weeks prior [P-36]. Workplace concerns cover hospital employment [P-17] and scared coworkers [P-35], but omit specifics like clerk role [P-34], PPE use [P-17], staying home post-test, desire to return without coughing [P-36], and medication motivation. Core facts align with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covered: COVID-19 condition, COVID test and negative result [P-35], cough duration of two weeks [P-2], test timing broadly, hospital work [P-17], scared coworkers [P-35]. Missed: exact test timing at symptom onset [P-36], clerk position [P-34], PPE awareness [P-17], staying home since test and eagerness to return without cough [P-36], medication desire driven by workplace return [P-35/P-36]. Approximately 60% coverage of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (P-2 for cough duration, P-17 for hospital, P-35 for test and concerns). Timing linked to P-35 (test mention) and P-2, though precise timing in P-36; no hallucinations, but 'knowledge graph' reference not in transcript (minor, as content grounded). Interpretations like 'concurrent' and 'high-stakes environment' plausible and supported.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address each question element (condition, test, timing, concerns) with no irrelevant or off-topic content; directly focused."
