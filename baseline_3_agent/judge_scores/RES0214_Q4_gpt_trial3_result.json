  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies the ordered test as a COVID-19 swab and quotes the supporting line [D-53].\n- Provides a generally correct rationale that COVID-19 was prioritized because it was considered the first infectious etiology to exclude and because the husband had similar symptoms (household transmission), aligning with [D-53].\n- However, it over-attributes prioritization to symptom-to-COVID linkage (“Knowledge Graph supports…”) which is not in the transcript and is not the key rationale emphasized in the Gold Answer (epidemiology/containment).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements:\n- COVID-19 swab ordered: Covered.\n- Priority rationale: household transmission pattern (“if your husband got it…”) : Covered.\n- Rationale tied to containment/urgency and self-isolation instructions while awaiting rule-out: Missing.\n- Influenza framed as a secondary consideration raised after COVID rule-out discussion and after noting no flu shot: Missing.\nOverall, it captures the main test and one major rationale point but omits multiple important supporting points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "- The COVID swab order and the clinician’s general infectious-rule-out statement are directly supported by [D-53].\n- The household transmission rationale is supported by [D-53] (and context [P-19]).\n- Mentions a “knowledge graph” and claims it links the symptoms specifically to COVID; this is not present in the transcript and is therefore ungrounded.\n- The answer does not include transcript-grounded points about self-isolation, despite those being explicitly stated in [D-53] and [D-54].",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (what test; why COVID was prioritized over influenza) with minimal extraneous content, though it includes an unnecessary mention of a “knowledge graph.”"
