  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's stated plan from [D-37], including the specific physical exam components (quick listen to heart and lungs as part of a quick physical exam) and the process (consult with supervising doctor, review discussion, return to discuss next steps). It matches the Gold Answer's core facts without any errors or contradictions, though it omits elaborative details like the foreshadowing in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], and interpretive notes on no diagnosis/meds.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: multi-step plan [D-37], physical exam components (listen to heart/lungs, quick physical exam), collaborative process (consult supervisor, review everything, return to discuss next steps). Missed: foreshadowing [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], no diagnosis/meds note, transcript ending context. Covers core 80-99% of key points focused on the stated plan.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-37] of transcript; direct quotes/paraphrases match exactly ('quick listen to your heart and lungs', 'I will go get the doctor that I'm working with', 'go over everything you talked about', 'where to go from here'). No hallucination or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the two main elements (physical exam components and process for next steps), with no off-topic content or tangents."
