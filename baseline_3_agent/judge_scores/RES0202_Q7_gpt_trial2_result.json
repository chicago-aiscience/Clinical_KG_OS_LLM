  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the day-by-day timeline in the Gold Answer: cough began Wednesday night as a mild dry cough; persisted Thursday with worsening and notable tiredness; worsened again Friday with new fever (>100°F) and decreased appetite/breakfast disinterest and suspected taste change. Minor issues: it implies possible breathing difficulty on Friday (“perhaps struggling slightly with breathing”), whereas the transcript is speculative/uncertain (mother says “maybe” but also thinks he’s just tired). It also adds nonessential content about the physician asking about chest pain/heart racing and COVID isolation; these are true to the transcript but not part of the asked evolution details.",
    "completeness": "Captures most key points: onset of cough Wednesday night; progressive worsening across Thursday and Friday; fever first appears Friday with approximate range; fatigue and decreased appetite Friday; suspected loss of taste Friday. Misses two Gold Answer elements: (1) mild runny nose noted (P-16), and (2) explicit correction that symptoms were ~3 days (P-4) and the stepwise recap in P-12. Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate references (P-1, P-2, P-15, P-17). The only notable overreach is framing breathing difficulty as a feature (“perhaps struggling slightly with breathing”) when it is explicitly uncertain/speculative in P-8. Added details about chest pain inquiry and isolation/COVID swab are present in the transcript, though not required by the question. Net: mostly grounded with minor interpretive drift.",
    "relevance": "Primarily answers the question by giving a clear day-by-day progression focused on cough onset and worsening, and emergence of fever and systemic symptoms. However, it includes some tangential information (doctor’s questions about chest pain/heart racing; isolation/COVID swab advice) that does not directly address the requested symptom evolution."

  "summary": "The answer is largely accurate and grounded with a clear day-by-day course, but it omits the mild runny nose and the explicit 3-day correction, and includes minor speculative/tangential details."
