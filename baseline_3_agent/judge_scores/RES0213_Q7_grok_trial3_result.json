  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer includes accurate facts where stated, such as teenage anxiety [P-21], reduced smoking to 5/day [P-13,14], recent academic stress [P-15,16], and chest pain onset 1.5 weeks ago [P-2,3]. However, it reverses the question's specified order (starts with anxiety instead of smoking at age 18 [P-18]), omits key details like smoking start at 18, escalation to 10/day for 2 years, 8-year anxiety gap [P-22], father's heart attack [P-8,30], and anxiety possibly returning [P-22]. It also introduces 'knowledge graph' which is not in the transcript. Core facts are correct but with minor discrepancies in timeline and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: teenage anxiety [P-21], smoking reduction/quit attempt [P-14], recent weeks academic stress/thesis [P-15,16], chest pain 1.5 weeks ago [P-2,3], stress as possible cause [P-8], links to anxiety [P-19,20]. Missed: smoking start age 18 [P-18], 2 years at 10 cigs/day, few months ago cut down [P-18], 8 years without anxiety [P-22], father's heart attack [P-8,30], pain noticeable when alone [P-9,29], first-time symptom [P-17]. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: anxiety teen [P-21], smoking details [P-13,14], stress [P-15,16], pain description [P-1,3,6,8], SOB self-induced [P-19], heart flutter in past anxiety [P-20]. Hallucinations: repeated 'knowledge graph' references (not in transcript), smoking 'classified as risk factor' by KG. Interpretations like 'baseline history contributing to current response' plausible but not directly stated. Some unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Addresses timeline of history (anxiety, smoking, stress, pain) and relations (stress-anxiety via [P-19], stress-pain via [P-8], smoking risk), but starts with anxiety instead of smoking as per question order, includes minor extraneous KG mentions. Mostly focused on question."
