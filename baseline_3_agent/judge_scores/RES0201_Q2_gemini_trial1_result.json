  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the long-acting beta agonist for COPD. However, it miscategorizes the patient's ability to drink fluids (functional tolerance) as a 'Self-Treatment Measure'. It also fails to mention the actual self-treatments explicitly stated in the transcript: salt water gargling and painkillers. Additionally, it references a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the provided source materials.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. It misses several key medications and treatments mentioned in the Gold Answer, including vitamins, salt water gargling, and painkillers. It also omits the patient's current status regarding alcohol, cannabis, and other drugs, although it does briefly touch on smoking history.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer includes a hallucination by referencing a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the source transcript. While it correctly cites the COPD medication, the interpretation of fluid intake as a treatment measure rather than a symptom check is a misrepresentation of the patient's statement in [P-2].",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question asked but fails to provide a comprehensive response by ignoring the specific self-treatments the patient actually attempted."
