  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer details the doctor's systematic exploration of living situation (D-45/P-45, D-46/P-46), sick contacts (D-47/P-47), workplace (D-48/P-48, D-50/P-50), and travel (D-49/P-49), plus substance use, concluding no clear source. The Generated Answer incorrectly states these were not explored (except indirectly for contacts via D-52), directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript with major factual inversions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: living situation and env triggers [P-45, P-46]; sick contacts [P-47]; workplace [P-48, P-50]; travel [P-49]; substance use [P-42-44]; no clear source. Generated covers none, instead denying exploration; 0% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims living, workplace, travel not explored, but transcript verifies D-45/46 (living), D-48/50 (workplace), D-49 (travel), D-47/50 (contacts); misrepresents D-52 contact tracing as exploration. Largely fabricated by false denials and ignoring verbatim questions.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses the question by listing the exact categories (living, workplace, travel, sick contacts) and claiming lack of exploration, with no off-topic content or tangents."
