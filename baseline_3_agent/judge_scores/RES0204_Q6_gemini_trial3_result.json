  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the diagnostic tests and the consultation with the supervisor. However, it misses the physical examination of the heart and lungs mentioned in the plan at [D-1]. It also infers the doctor will return to 'present findings from the tests', whereas the transcript states they will 'arrange' the tests and then return with the supervisor to discuss 'where to go from here', which may occur before results are available.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but omits the physical exam (listening to heart and lungs) which was part of the doctor's initial plan communicated in [D-1]. It captures the tests, consultation, and general follow-up step.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. The mention of 'presenting findings' is a slight interpretive leap regarding the timing of the return visit, but it is plausible within a clinical context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question regarding tests, consultation, and follow-up steps."
