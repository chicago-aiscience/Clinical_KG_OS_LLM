  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: sudden very short of breath [P-1] matches sudden-onset SOB; dry cough [P-4] matches dry cough no sputum; seizure previous night [P-8] matches seizure report; 37.4°C [P-5] matches fever measurement. No factual errors or contradictions present.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: sudden-onset SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure previous night [P-8], fever 37.4°C [P-5]. Missed: SOB upon waking/3 hours prior [P-1/P-11], cough sudden that morning [D-2/P-2], underlying epilepsy [P-8], fine after seizure/went to bed [P-8], fever 'mild' and confirmed morning [P-5/D-6/P-6]. Covers ~60% of detailed key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: [P-1] for SOB, [P-4] for dry cough, [P-8] for seizure, [P-5] for temperature. No unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around specific respiratory symptoms (SOB, dry cough), neurological symptom (seizure), and fever measurement (37.4°C), with no off-topic content."
