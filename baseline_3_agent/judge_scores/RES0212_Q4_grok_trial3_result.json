  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies constitutional symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance from cough as constitutional, vague 'general illness') and exposure risks (e.g., cat exposure, vaping/marijuana as key risks), missing the Gold Answer's specifics like night sweats [D-5], weight loss [D-6-D8], sick contacts [D-14,D-15,D-32], travel [D-33-D34], IV drugs [D-40], and cocaine/heroin [D-39]; it only partially overlaps on hemoptysis [D-10/D-47] and TB exclusion but with factual distortions in categorization and omissions of core screened items.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: hemoptysis (partial), absence of constitutional symptoms (vague), TB exclusion (partial); missed: night sweats, unexplained weight loss/loose clothes, all sick contacts (class, recent, roommate), travel/exotic locales, IV drug use, cocaine/heroin, stiff neck, nausea/vomiting, body pain; covers <20-49% of specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "All listed screenings (sleep disturbance [D-20/D-47], hemoptysis [D-47/D-10], cat allergy/exposure [D-27/P-27], substance use/smoking [D-36/P-36]) are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations; no major fabrications, though interpretations (e.g., sleep as constitutional, cat/substances as key risks) stretch context but remain grounded.",
    "relevance": "Addresses question by listing denied symptoms/exposures and linking to TB/chronic infections exclusion, but includes off-topic details (cats, vaping details) and vague summaries instead of specifics, making it partially relevant."
