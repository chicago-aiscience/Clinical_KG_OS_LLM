  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core management recommendations from the Gold Answer, including the COVID swab test with timing, 14-day isolation specifically from the younger sister, and ER precautions for worsening symptoms. Minor discrepancies include not explicitly noting the full household composition (parents and sister), omission of false-negative possibility and other viral illnesses, lack of mention of no medications or supportive care, and school requirements. It slightly rephrases the asthma consideration by linking it to a negative swab and persisting symptoms, which aligns closely but not exactly with the transcript's conditional on absence of fever. Overall, core facts are correct with minor omissions and rephrasing.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab test and results timing (yes), isolation for 14 days from younger sister (yes), ER precautions listed accurately (yes). Missed or partially covered: full household details including parents (only sister mentioned), false-negative risk and alternative viral illness (not mentioned), no medications/supportive approach/waiting for results (implied but not explicit), mother's acknowledgment of viral care (not mentioned), school test requirement (not mentioned). Covers approximately 70-80% of key points, focusing well on the question's specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: COVID swab [D-44], isolation 14 days including from sister [D-44], symptoms consistent with COVID [D-44], ER criteria match verbatim descriptions [D-44], asthma consideration [D-45]. No hallucinations; citations accurate and content grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses the question's focus on diagnostic tests, isolation instructions/duration, and specific household member (younger sister) to isolate from, while including relevant additional management like ER advice without off-topic digressions."
