  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all the key factual elements from the Gold Answer: COVID swab with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation, isolation from younger sister specifically, and ER precautions for worsening symptoms. The addition of asthma as a differential (from D-45) is accurate but represents a conditional statement that wasn't fully developed in the transcript. All facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main management components: diagnostic test (COVID swab with timing), isolation duration (14 days), specific household member to isolate from (younger sister), and return-to-ER precautions. However, it misses several details present in the Gold Answer: the household composition (parents + sister from P-35), acknowledgment of false-negative possibility, mention that no medications were prescribed, the supportive/observational approach, the mother's acknowledgment about viral illness management, and the school's requirement for test results. Covers approximately 65-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The COVID swab recommendation [D-44], 14-day isolation [D-44], isolation from younger sister [D-44], and ER precautions [D-44] are all directly supported. The mention of asthma consideration [D-45] is accurately cited. No hallucinated content detected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: diagnostic tests (COVID swab), isolation instructions with duration (14 days), and specific household member mentioned (younger sister). The ER precautions and asthma mention, while relevant to overall management, slightly extend beyond the core question but remain clinically pertinent. Highly focused response with minimal tangential content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate information that is well-grounded in the transcript, directly addressing the question about management measures, diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, and specific household members. It correctly identifies the COVID swab, 14-day isolation period, and younger sister as the specific person to isolate from. However, it lacks several contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including household composition, discussion of false negatives, the supportive care approach, and school requirements. The response is clinically sound and highly relevant but incomplete in its coverage of all elements from the reference answer."
