  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies initial headache and cough 4 days ago, stable severity (explicitly 'stayed around the same' for both), GI symptoms with diarrhea precisely 2 days ago (~2 days after initial), nausea/vomiting 'few days back' with vomiting yesterday, anosmia 1 day ago (~3 days after initial). Generated correctly identifies initial symptoms and timeline, anosmia 1 day ago with accurate relative timing (~3 days after), cough stable ('around the same'), but for headache uses 'pretty persistent' [P-3] instead of stable severity [P-9], and GI timeline is vaguely 'few days back' [P-1] without specifying diarrhea 2 days ago [P-28] or precise relative timing. Minor discrepancies in precision and phrasing, but core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: initial h/c 4da; h details (persistent, same sev); c dry/stable; GI diarrhea 2da (5-6x/d), n/v few d back (vomit yesterday, n today); smell 1da. Generated covers initial h/c 4da (100%); smell timing relative (100%); GI start 'few d back' with n today/v yesterday (partial, misses diarrhea specifics); cough stable (100%); headache persistent (partial, misses 'same sev'). Covers ~85% of key timeline/severity points, misses precise GI details and explicit headache stability.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly grounded: initial [P-1]; smell decline 1da ago [P-24]; GI 'few d back' [P-1], n today/v yesterday [P-32]; cough same [P-11]; headache persistent/Tylenol [P-3]. Relative timing for smell logically derived (4da initial - 1da smell = 3d later), no unverifiable or hallucinated content; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response as clear timeline directly addressing question elements: first symptoms (h/c 4da), smell relative to initial (~3d after), GI timing (after initial), h/c stability (cough same, headache persistent). No off-topic content, perfectly focused on 4-day progression."
