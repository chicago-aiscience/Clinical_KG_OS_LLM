  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the COVID swab, the 24-48 hour timeframe, the 14-day isolation period, and the younger sister as the specific household contact. It also accurately lists the ER safety-netting symptoms. However, it misrepresents the doctor's statement about asthma; the doctor stated asthma would be considered if the child *did not* have a fever [D-45], while the generated answer suggests it would be considered if the COVID test came back negative.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all specific parts of the prompt (test, isolation duration, and household member). It misses secondary details found in the Gold Answer, such as the school's requirement for a test result and the doctor's mention of potential false negatives/other viral illnesses.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are well-grounded in the transcript with correct speaker tags. The logic regarding the asthma diagnosis is slightly unfaithful to the transcript's conditional logic (fever vs. negative test), but it is not a complete hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly answering the multi-part question with clear headings and bullet points."
