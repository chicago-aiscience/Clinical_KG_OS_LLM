  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly attributes the chest pain to current anxiety attacks, whereas the patient states they haven't had an anxiety attack in eight years [P-21] and specifically links 'heart fluttering' (not the sharp pain) to those past episodes [P-20]. It also misses the critical characteristic that the pain is triggered by taking a deep breath [P-3].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the total duration of the symptoms (1.5 weeks), the specific physical trigger of taking a deep breath, the specific resolution situations (talking to others, hands-on tasks), and the fact that the pain does not worsen with exercise.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a connection between the chest pain and anxiety attacks by misinterpreting [P-20]. In the transcript, the patient is referring to heart palpitations/fluttering when discussing anxiety attacks, not the 'sharp, strong' chest pain that started recently. The claim that the pain is 'exclusive' to these episodes is contradicted by the patient's report of pain while walking and studying.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it directly attempts to address the categories requested (quality, duration, occurrence, and resolution). However, the content provided within those categories is largely inaccurate or incomplete."
