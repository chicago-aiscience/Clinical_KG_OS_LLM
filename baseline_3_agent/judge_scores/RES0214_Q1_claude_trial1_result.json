  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) and correctly states that the patient denied cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing. However, there is a significant error in the 'Supporting Evidence' section where it states the patient 'immediately began reporting her own history without answering' about neck stiffness. The transcript clearly shows the patient answered 'No' to neck stiffness at [P-7]. This misrepresentation of the transcript is a factual error.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points but lacks important details present in the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the four symptoms and the pertinent negatives but omits: (1) the temporal sequence of symptoms (stuffy nose appearing first, before the fever), (2) the duration specifics (fever for three days, muscle aches for two-three days), (3) that the sore throat was 'not going away' and 'still present', (4) the clarification that muscle aches were distinguished from joint pain, and (5) specific citations showing the temporal confirmation by the doctor and the detailed discussion about swallowing (ability to swallow food/liquids, no coughing/aspiration). The answer covers approximately 60-70% of the key details.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations, but contains one significant error in interpretation. The claim that 'the patient immediately began reporting her own history without answering' the neck stiffness question directly contradicts [P-7] where the patient clearly says 'No.' This is a hallucinated interpretation. All other claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations provided ([P-1], [P-13], [D-7]).",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: identifying the four reported symptoms and listing which clinically significant symptoms were denied. The structure is clear and focused. However, the 'Supporting Evidence' section adds an incorrect interpretation that, while attempting to provide supporting detail, actually introduces irrelevant and inaccurate commentary about the patient's response pattern."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four symptoms and the denied symptoms but contains a factual error in the supporting evidence section regarding the neck stiffness response. It lacks important temporal details and specifics about symptom progression present in the Gold Answer, covering approximately 60-70% of key points. While mostly grounded in the transcript, the hallucinated interpretation about the patient's response pattern reduces faithfulness. The answer remains largely relevant to the question asked."
