  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript where stated: cough ~3 months (P-2), worsening last 3 days productive with gross greenish gunk (P-2, P-9, P-12), painful when coughing (P-3), fatigue (P-19), sleep disruption from cough (P-19-21, D-47), denied blood in sputum (P-10, D-47), denied pain elsewhere (P-19). No contradictions or errors in reported details, though it uses 'persistent' for a recurrent cough (minor phrasing discrepancy per P-2).",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: cough duration (3 months), recent productive change (3 days), sputum characteristics (greenish, gross gunk), cough pain (chest discomfort when coughing), sleep disturbance and fatigue (wakes at night last month), denied blood and general pain. Missed: initial dry/intermittent/recurrent nature, onset at pole class, no foul smell, specific nightly waking frequency/duration, subjective fevers/hot at night, exercise impairment, denied night sweats, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, sick contacts. Covers ~30-40% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: e.g., P-2/P-9 for cough/sputum, P-3 for pain when coughing, P-19 for tiredness/sleep/denied pain, P-10/D-47 for no blood. Doctor's summary in D-47 accurately reflected. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around respiratory symptoms (cough/sputum), associated symptoms (fatigue/sleep), and explicitly denied symptoms (pain, blood), directly matching the question's focus on reported symptoms, cough/sputum characteristics, and denials. No off-topic content."
