  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the shift from baseline to acute presentation and lists the correct symptoms (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea). However, it references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source material, though the clinical conclusions drawn are correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it does not mention the rescue inhaler frequency (once every two weeks), the specific impact on exercise tolerance (dog walks becoming trickier), the possible fever, and most importantly, the patient's direct quote that this is the 'worst' episode she has experienced. It also fails to mention the lack of prior hospitalizations as a metric of severity.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript. However, the mention of a 'knowledge graph' as a source for symptom categorization is an hallucination regarding the context provided, even if the symptoms themselves are in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the three parts of the question: evolution, direction of change, and comparison to prior episodes."
