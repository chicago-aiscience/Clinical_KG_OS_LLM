  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims there are 'no doctor turns' in the transcript and that the transcript cuts off at [P-26], which is factually incorrect. The provided transcript clearly includes doctor turns [D-1] through [D-38], with the final doctor turn [D-37] explicitly outlining next steps. The Generated Answer completely contradicts the Gold Answer and misrepresents the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) the doctor reviewing information with another doctor, (2) collaborative decision-making, (3) coming back shortly to discuss next steps, (4) potential tests being ordered, or (5) determining how to move forward. Instead, it incorrectly states these details are absent from the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination by claiming the transcript only contains patient turns and ends at [P-26]. This directly contradicts the provided source material which clearly shows doctor turns through [D-38]. The claim that 'it is not possible to answer' the question is false given that [D-37] and [D-38] explicitly contain the requested information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. Instead of identifying the next steps communicated by the doctor, it incorrectly claims the information doesn't exist in the transcript. The speculative clinical inferences added at the end are not relevant to what the doctor actually communicated."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect and fails on all evaluation dimensions. It falsely claims the transcript contains no doctor turns and ends prematurely, when in fact the transcript clearly shows doctor-patient dialogue through [D-38] with explicit next steps outlined in [D-37]. This represents a fundamental misreading of the source material, resulting in 0% coverage of the Gold Answer's key points and complete failure to address the question."
