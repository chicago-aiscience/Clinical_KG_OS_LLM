  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis investigated as COVID-19, the negative test result, and the evidence prompting the investigation (persistent cough, initial flu-like symptoms, and working in a hospital with concerned coworkers). It aligns perfectly with the core facts provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but omits the specific timing of the test mentioned in the Gold Answer (performed approximately two weeks ago at symptom onset) and the specific job title (clerk), though the latter was partially addressed by 'hospital worker'. It captures the essential clinical reasoning and social pressure mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript. The citations [P-2, P-15, P-14, P-17, P-35] are accurate and correctly map to the patient's statements.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing all parts of the multi-part question without including extraneous information."
