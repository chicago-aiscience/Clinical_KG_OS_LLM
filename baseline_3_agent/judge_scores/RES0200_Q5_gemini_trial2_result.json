  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It states the COPD diagnosis was approximately two years ago, ignoring the patient's correction in P-2 that it was 'probably five years ago.' More importantly, it explicitly claims the transcript does not specify daily consumption, whereas the transcript (P-44) clearly states the patient currently smokes half a pack a day and previously smoked 1-2 packs.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to address key components of the prompt. It misses the specific current consumption level (half a pack) and the history of how it changed over time (from 1-2 packs down to half). It also misses the 10-year timeline of the chronic cough mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that information regarding smoking consumption is missing from the transcript. It also refers to a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the source text. These are significant deviations from the provided evidence.",
    "relevance": "While the answer is structured to address the question, it fails to provide the specific details requested in the prompt (consumption levels and changes over time), instead incorrectly stating that this information is unavailable."
