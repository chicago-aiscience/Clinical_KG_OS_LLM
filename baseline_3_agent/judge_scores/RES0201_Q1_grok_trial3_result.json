  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer misses major reported symptoms like difficulty breathing (prominently discussed in P-7 to P-11), fatigue, and muscle aches (P-25, P-26), and inaccurately states there are no explicit denials for cough (P-15 'No'), runny nose (P-16 'No'), headaches (P-17 'No'), chest pain (P-18 'nope'), and fever (P-23 'I don't think so'), while Gold Answer correctly lists these; taste is partially correct but understated; significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: sore throat (partial), swallowing difficulty (detail of sore throat), reduced taste (minimal); missed entirely: difficulty breathing details, fatigue/muscle aches details, explicit denials of cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills/night sweats; covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about sore throat, swallowing, and taste are verifiable with accurate citations (P-2, P-19); however, the assertion of 'no explicit statements denying cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, or chest pain' is false and hallucinates absences contradicted by direct 'No' responses in P-15, P-16, P-17, P-18, P-23; multiple hallucinated facts about denials.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists reported symptoms and addresses explicitly denied commonly screened symptoms as asked, with no off-topic content or tangents; perfectly focused on the question."
