  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC products the patient tried for chest discomfort (Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer) and correctly states they did not help much, consistent with [P-6]. However, it incorrectly states there is “no indication” the patient takes any routine OTC supplements; the patient explicitly reports taking a multivitamin as their only ongoing supplement/medication [P-25]. This is a key error because the question asks for regular routine supplements as well.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) Tylenol, (2) Advil, (3) Alka‑Seltzer tried for chest pain, and (4) lack of meaningful relief (“hasn’t really helped very much”)—all from [P-6].\nMissed/incorrect: (1) daily multivitamin as routine supplement [P-25]; (2) that they otherwise take no medications (implied by [P-25] in response to medication question). Gold also mentions non-medication stress management and smoking reduction, but those are not OTC meds/supplements; omission of these is less critical to this question than missing the multivitamin.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by [P-6]. The claim that there is no indication of routine OTC supplements is contradicted by the transcript (multivitamin in [P-25]), making that portion unfaithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on OTC medications/supplements and the effectiveness of pain-relief attempts, which directly addresses the question. The only issue is the incorrect handling of routine supplements."
