  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's suspicion of COVID-19 based on overlapping symptoms [D-52] and lists key initial symptoms (headache, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) from [P-1], which align with the Gold Answer's core symptoms. It accurately highlights loss of smell [P-24] as particularly characteristic. Minor discrepancies include not specifying 'dry cough' [P-12], omitting fatigue [P-19], and not detailing pertinent negatives or the doctor's specific question [D-24], but core facts match without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: doctor's statement to rule out COVID [D-52], main symptom combination (headache, cough, GI symptoms), loss of smell as characteristic [P-24]. Missed: explicit 'dry cough' [P-12], fatigue [P-19], doctor's question on smell/taste [D-24], alternative viral illness, pertinent negatives (no fever [P-18], no runny nose [P-23], no aches [P-27]). Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: symptoms from [P-1], doctor's COVID suspicion [D-52], loss of smell [P-24]. Citations are accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; the notation '[SYMPTOM] smell loss --[INDICATES]--> [DIAGNOSIS] covid' is interpretive but grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the symptom combination leading to COVID suspicion and the characteristic symptom (loss of smell). No off-topic content; perfectly focused."
