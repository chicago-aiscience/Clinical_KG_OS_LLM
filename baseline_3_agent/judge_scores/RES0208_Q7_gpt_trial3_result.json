  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the initial (“couple of days”) symptoms as shortness of breath, fatigue/rundown, and weakness with decreased appetite, and it correctly places the subjective fever as occurring “yesterday.” It also correctly identifies cough and sore throat as just starting.\n\nHowever, it misclassifies the loss of taste: the transcript and Gold Answer place anosmia/ageusia onset as the morning of the consultation (newly noticed that morning), whereas the Generated Answer places it under “Symptoms just beginning to emerge (at the time of consultation).” While this is close temporally, it does not match the asked-for separation (“loss of taste that morning” vs “only just beginning to emerge at the time of consultation”). This is a meaningful timeline error.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: onset SOB + fatigue/rundown/tiredness; weakness and reduced appetite; subjective fever yesterday; loss of taste (mentioned); emerging cough and sore throat.\n\nKey elements missed or undercovered: diminished smell (acknowledged when asked); generalized body aches/overall achy; mild headaches (not more than usual/baseline stress headaches); nuance that breathing felt “more laborious” rather than frank inability to breathe; the Gold Answer also notes body aches’ onset was unspecified.\n\nOverall, the answer captures the major phases but omits several symptoms included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by transcript citations (SOB/fatigue [P-1], weakness/appetite [P-2], subjective fever [P-4], loss of taste [P-4], emerging cough [P-7], emerging sore throat [P-9], clinician summary [D-36]).\n\nThe main ungrounded element is referencing a “provided medical knowledge graph” and claiming alignment with COVID-19 knowledge-graph features—this is not in the transcript and is unnecessary. Otherwise, it avoids major fabricated clinical details.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on reconstructing the symptom timeline as asked (onset vs yesterday vs emerging symptoms). Minor tangential/irrelevant content includes the mention of a “medical knowledge graph” and COVID alignment, but it does not substantially derail the timeline reconstruction."
