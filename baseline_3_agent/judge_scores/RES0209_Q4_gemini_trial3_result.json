  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies the screening for infectious causes. It claims 'chest tightness' and 'other health problems' were the screens used, whereas the transcript shows these were part of the general asthma and medical history. The actual infectious screening questions (fever, loss of taste/smell, nausea, vomiting, belly pain) were entirely omitted from the screening list.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the screening for recent colds, fever, loss of taste/smell, GI symptoms, sick contacts, and travel history. It only captures the planned diagnostic test (COVID-19 swab), covering less than 20% of the relevant information required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "While the symptoms and history mentioned (wheezing, cough, sister's asthma) are present in the transcript, the generated answer misattributes them as responses to the 'infectious cause' screening. This is a contextual misrepresentation of the transcript's structure.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab as the planned test, it fails to address the specific symptoms and exposure history related to the infectious screening, which was the primary focus of the question."
