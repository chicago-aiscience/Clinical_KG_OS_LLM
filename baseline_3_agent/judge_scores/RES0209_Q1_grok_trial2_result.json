  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness) matching the Gold Answer and transcript, but has significant errors: cough duration listed as 'week or so' (P-1) omitting the correction to 'two weeks' (P-13); chest tightness cites wrong response P-4 instead of P-20; misses details like wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use (P-17), hard time breathing (P-19); most critically, falsely claims no nighttime details exist despite explicit transcript evidence (P-18) contradicting Gold Answer's coverage of reduced nighttime frequency, making it a significant factual contradiction on a core question element.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: dry cough (partial, misses full 2-week duration and non-productive confirmation), shortness of breath (basic, misses 'hard time breathing' detail), wheezing (basic, misses frequency > bronchodilator), chest tightness (yes); daytime prominence (partial via cough and triggers); nighttime frequency (completely missed, claimed absent). Covers ~60% of key points, missing substantial details especially on frequency difference and elaborations.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: cough/SOB/wheeze/daytime from P-1/P-15; daytime triggers P-9 accurate. However, chest tightness wrong citation (P-4 unrelated to chest, actual P-20); falsely states 'transcript does not contain specific details' on nighttime (directly contradicted by P-18: nighttime symptoms less frequent, every other/2 days), introducing hallucination by denying transcript content; minor unverifiable cite error compounds to multiple issues.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response around question's requested symptoms (cough character, breathing difficulties, wheezing, chest sensations) in bullets and addresses daytime/nighttime frequency (though erroneously on night), with no off-topic content or tangents; minor error in claiming absence doesn't detract from focus."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is mostly relevant and covers core daytime symptoms accurately but has significant flaws in completeness, correctness, and faithfulness due to missing nighttime frequency details, a fabricated claim of their absence, and citation errors."
