  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly asserts that the transcript does not contain information regarding Jessica's father, her cousin, the farm, home-schooling, or COVID-19. However, all these details are explicitly present in the transcript (Father: P-33; Cousin: P-30; Farm: P-43; Home-schooling/COVID: P-41, P-42, P-55). This is a major factual error regarding the source content.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to discuss the family history of allergies/asthma as a diagnostic context, the significance of the isolated farm environment in determining transmission, or the reduction of zoonotic risk. It only addresses the brother's cold.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source text because it claims information is missing when it is clearly available in the provided segments. This is a meta-hallucination about the scope of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the specific multi-part question asked. Instead of explaining how these factors collectively relate to her symptoms, it dismisses most of the factors as non-existent in the text, providing only a narrow analysis of the brother's cold."
