  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC products the patient tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer) and correctly reports they did not help much, consistent with [P-6]. However, it incorrectly states there is no indication the patient takes any routine OTC supplements; the patient explicitly reports taking a multivitamin as their only routine supplement/“medication” [P-25]. This is a substantive factual error relative to the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) Tylenol, (2) Advil, (3) Alka‑Seltzer as attempted OTC remedies; (4) lack of effectiveness (“hasn’t really helped very much”). Missed: (1) daily multivitamin as routine supplement [P-25]; (2) that the patient otherwise takes no medications (no prescriptions) per [P-25] (included in Gold Answer).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements about the chest-pain OTC trials and their ineffectiveness are directly supported by [P-6]. However, the statement that there is no indication of routine OTC supplements directly contradicts [P-25], where the patient reports taking a multivitamin. This is an unfaithful (contradicted) claim.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on OTC medications/supplements and effectiveness, which matches the question. The main relevance issue is the incorrect omission/denial of the routine multivitamin, but the content remains on-topic."
