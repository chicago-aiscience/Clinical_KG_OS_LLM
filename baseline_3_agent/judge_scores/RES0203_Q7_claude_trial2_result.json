  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that all three symptoms began two days prior to the consultation and started simultaneously, consistent with P-1, P-2, and P-6. It accurately notes the symptoms were consistent/stable without worsening (P-5, P-8). However, it fails to mention the partial nature of the sensory losses (can still smell very strong odors, taste very salty foods but not banana from P-4), which is a factual omission present in the Gold Answer. It correctly states no prior history (P-3).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main timeline elements (simultaneous onset two days prior, consistency without worsening, no prior history). However, it misses several key details from the Gold Answer: (1) the specific confirmation that the cough started at the same time as sensory changes (D-6, P-6 interaction), (2) the detailed description of the partial sensory losses with specific examples (P-4), (3) the explicit quote 'no, nothing like this' from P-3, and (4) the connection to COVID symptoms mentioned by the doctor (D-39). Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations to P-1, P-8, and general references are accurate. There are no hallucinated facts. The answer appropriately notes 'no mention in the transcript' regarding prior history, which is faithful though slightly imprecise (P-3 explicitly addresses this). No fabricated content present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: when symptoms began relative to each other (simultaneously), whether they worsened or fluctuated (remained consistent), and prior history (none mentioned). The response is well-focused on the question with no irrelevant content. Minor structural differences from Gold Answer but maintains complete relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and relevant response that correctly identifies the simultaneous onset of symptoms two days prior, their consistent nature without worsening, and lack of prior history. However, it lacks completeness compared to the Gold Answer, missing important details such as the partial nature of sensory losses with specific examples (very strong odors, very salty foods, banana), explicit confirmation of simultaneous cough onset, and the clinical context about COVID symptoms. All stated facts are faithful to the transcript with appropriate citations."
