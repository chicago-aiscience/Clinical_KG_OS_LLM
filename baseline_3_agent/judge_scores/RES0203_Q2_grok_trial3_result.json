  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately states no prior self-treatments, matching Gold and transcript [P-9: 'No, I haven't tried anything']. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test recommendation [D-39] without claiming medication prescription, and details instructions on timeline and isolation precisely as in Gold/transcript. No factual errors or contradictions; minor omission of no regular meds does not impact accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: no prior treatments (full), COVID test/swab (full), results timeline (full), isolation instructions including potential extension (full). Missed: explicit no regular medications [D-24,P-24], possible other tests, and consulting supervising doctor [D-40]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All core claims verifiable: no treatments [D-9/P-9], test/swab and rationale [D-39], instructions [D-39]; citations accurate. Minor hallucination: references non-existent 'knowledge graph'. Symptoms context [P-1,P-8] verifiable but tangential. Mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question: sections for prior treatments and doctor's recommendation/instructions. Directly addresses self-treatments (none), recommended intervention (test), and associated instructions; no off-topic content."
