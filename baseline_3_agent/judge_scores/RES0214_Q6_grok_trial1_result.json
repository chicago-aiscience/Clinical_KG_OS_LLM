  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the COVID-19 swab was ordered [D-53], self-isolation for patient and husband [D-53], all consistent with Gold and transcript. No factual errors or contradictions, though it omits physical exam [D-52] and consulting the doctor [D-55], these are omissions not inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) COVID swab, 2) self-isolation for patient/husband, 3) physical exam, 4) consult supervising doctor/return. Generated covers 1 and 2 fully (~50%), vaguely addresses further investigation as next steps but misses 3 and 4 specifically.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims verifiable: swab and isolation [D-53], 'work this up further' [D-53]. Minor unverifiable mention of 'knowledge graph' not in transcript; no other hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around question's elements (test, precautions for patient/husband, next steps); perfectly focused with no off-topic content."
