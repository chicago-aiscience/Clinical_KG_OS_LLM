  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several *present* symptoms: chest tightness with inspiration, breathing feeling harder, and upper-airway complaints (hoarseness, phlegm, throat clearing), and it correctly notes denial of cough and chest pain.\n\nHowever, it contains a major factual error by stating: “The transcript does not contain explicit reporting or denial of fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, or sweating.” The transcript *explicitly* includes denials of anxiety/sweating/impending doom [P-6], fevers [P-12], night sweats [P-13], chills [P-14], and weight loss [P-15]. This directly contradicts the source and Gold Answer. In addition, it cites chest-pain denial primarily to [P-1] (where the patient says “not really pain”) rather than the clearer explicit denial [P-5].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered:\n- Chest tightness present and related to breathing in/walking (partially covered)\n- Difficulty getting a full breath (partially captured as “harder to breathe”)\n- Hoarseness/phlegm/throat clearing; no cough (covered)\n- Denied cough (covered)\n- Denied chest pain (covered)\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed:\n- Diffuse “all over” chest tightness [P-8]\n- Chronicity/constancy over 3 days and triggers (deep breath, getting up from chair, exertion) [P-9, P-10]\n- Explicit denials: anxiety/sweating/impending doom [P-6], fevers [P-12], night sweats [P-13], chills [P-14], weight loss [P-15]\n\nOverall, it captures some positive symptoms but omits most of the required explicit denials and several descriptive features of the main complaint.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are well-grounded and accurately cited (hoarseness/phlegm/throat clearing; no cough). However, the note claiming the transcript does not contain explicit reporting/denial of fevers/night sweats/chills/weight loss/anxiety/sweating is not just unverifiable—it is contradicted by multiple explicit lines [P-6, P-12 to P-15]. The mention of a “knowledge graph provided” is also extraneous/unverifiable from the supplied materials.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked domains (respiratory/upper airway/chest symptoms and explicit denials) and does not introduce major unrelated tangents. However, it fails to list many of the specific denials explicitly requested, reducing how well it satisfies the question."
