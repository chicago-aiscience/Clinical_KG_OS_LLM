  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error: it consistently refers to the patient using male pronouns ('he','him','his') when the Gold Answer correctly identifies the patient as female ('her','she'). The core factual elements are present (father's heart attack in 50s, smoking history of 5-10 cigarettes/day, Masters thesis stress), but this gender error is a significant factual mistake. The citation references are accurate [P-8, P-13, P-14, P-15, P-16, P-19].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main factors from the Gold Answer: family history (father's heart attack in 50s), smoking history (10 cigarettes/day reduced to 5), and psychosocial stressors (Masters thesis pressure). However, it omits several key details present in the Gold Answer: the father now sees 'a lot of heart doctors' [P-30], the paternal grandfather's unknown cardiac history [P-30], the patient living alone in London [P-26, P-27], nervousness about running [P-28], and the return of teenage anxiety attacks [P-22]. It covers approximately 70% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer introduces content not verifiable in the transcript, specifically references to a 'Knowledge Graph' with relationship types like [heart attack --[FAMILY_HISTORY]--> heart disease] and [smoke --[RISK_FACTOR]--> chest pain]. These elements appear to be fabricated or imported from external sources not present in the provided transcript. While the core clinical facts are grounded in the transcript, these Knowledge Graph references constitute hallucinated content. The main claims about family history, smoking, and stress are verifiable in the transcript citations provided.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: family history's contribution, smoking history's role, and psychosocial stressors' impact. It explicitly discusses how these factors interact to create anxiety about heart disease. The 'Interaction' section specifically addresses the cyclical relationship between stress, symptoms, and fear. However, it includes irrelevant content about a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not contribute to answering the question and appears to be from a different context or system."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the three main factors requested (family history, smoking, psychosocial stress) and their interactions, with accurate citations to the transcript. However, it contains a significant factual error (incorrect patient gender throughout), omits important details about the father's ongoing care, living situation, and anxiety history, and includes fabricated 'Knowledge Graph' references not present in the source material. While the core clinical narrative is mostly accurate and relevant, these issues substantially reduce the quality of the response."
