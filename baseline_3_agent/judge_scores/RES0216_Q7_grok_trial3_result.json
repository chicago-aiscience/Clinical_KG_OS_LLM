  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states onset 3 days ago first noticed on dog walk [P-4], no trigger just came on [P-3], staying the same/steady [P-2,P-3], always there but worse with walks/getting up/big breaths [P-9,P-10], inspiration [P-1,P-5], reduced walks from 2 to 1/day [P-22]. Generated correctly notes 3 days onset [P-1], tightness on inspiration [P-1], worse on dog walks [P-1,P-9], but incorrectly states trend not explicitly stated (contradicts P-2/P-3), says continues full daily routine (contradicts P-22 reduction), misses other exacerbators/chair/breaths/no trigger, adds unrequested hoarseness/D-36 asthma diff misinterpretation; significant errors/contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3-day onset (covered), first on dog walk (implied via P-1 not explicit P-4), no trigger (missed), staying same (missed), exacerbators walks/chair/breath (partial walks only), inspiration (covered), reduced to 1 walk/day (missed, says continues), no work miss/noticeable limit (missed). Covers ~30% (onset, walks trigger, inspiration).",
    "faithfulness": "Onset/nature/walks grounded [P-1,P-5,P-9]; hoarseness [P-11] verifiable but extra; 'trend not stated' false (P-2/P-3 explicit); impact 'continues daily' partial [P-1] ignores P-22 reduction; D-36 'no SOB exercise/different asthma' loose summary (patient P-7 some SOB, P-16 different feel), doctor suspects asthma; multiple ungrounded/misstated claims.",
    "relevance": "Addresses onset/triggers/impact directly with structure matching question elements, minor extras (hoarseness, D-36) not off-topic; misses trend/evolution but attempts section."
