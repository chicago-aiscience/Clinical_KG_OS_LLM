  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three main symptoms (reduced smell, lost taste, mild dry cough) and notes that smell is a reduction rather than complete loss based on P-1 phrasing. However, it inaccurately presents taste as simply 'lost' without acknowledging the partial nature detailed in P-4 (can taste very salty foods, not banana), and omits duration (two days), cough starting simultaneously, non-productive nature, and no triggers. These are discrepancies from the Gold Answer's precise factual details on degrees and consistencies, making core facts mostly correct but with some errors on symptom degrees.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: symptoms (smell partial with bad odors detail, taste partial with salty/banana detail, mild dry cough), two-day duration, sensory consistencies, cough details (dry/non-productive/same time/no worsening/no triggers). Generated covers general smell reduction (no specific perception details), general taste loss (no partial details), mild dry cough and its consistency. Misses ~70% including all specific perception details, duration, cough onset/timing/productivity/triggers, sensory consistency explicitly. Covers 20-49%.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly grounded in the transcript: smell/taste from P-1 quotes, cough from P-1 and consistency from P-8. No hallucinations; the inference of smell not being complete is supported by P-1 ('as well as used to') and later P-4. Citations accurate and verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly lists the requested sensory (smell, taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms with degrees where noted, using bullet points focused on the question without any off-topic content or tangents."
