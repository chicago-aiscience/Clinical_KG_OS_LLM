  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the respiratory condition considered and ruled out, accurately cites the positive family history in grandparents, and correctly identifies the two key symptoms (shortness of breath and wheezing) that the patient does NOT exhibit even during physical activity. All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the essential elements: (1) asthma was considered and ruled out, (2) family history in grandparents, (3) shortness of breath absent, (4) wheezing absent, and (5) these symptoms absent even with physical activity. However, it omits several details present in the Gold Answer: the prior workup ('been worked up for that'), the doctor's acknowledgment at D-30, the mother's definitive conclusion, the patient's self-report of being 'pretty healthy otherwise,' and the note that this dry cough is a new presentation. These omissions represent approximately 30-35% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at P-28. The citation [P-28] is accurate. No hallucinated content is present. The answer stays grounded in what the mother explicitly stated without adding unsupported details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: identifies the condition (asthma), notes it was ruled out, mentions the family history in grandparents, and specifies the symptoms NOT exhibited during physical activity. The response is focused and contains no irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and highly relevant, correctly identifying asthma as the ruled-out condition and accurately citing the key clinical findings the patient does NOT exhibit. It is well-grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations. However, it lacks completeness by omitting several contextual details from the Gold Answer, including the prior workup, the doctor's acknowledgment, and the patient's general health status, covering approximately 65-70% of the Gold Answer's key points."
