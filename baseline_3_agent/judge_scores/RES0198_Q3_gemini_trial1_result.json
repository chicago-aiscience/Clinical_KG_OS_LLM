  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the symptoms (stuffy/runny nose), the progression (stuffy to runny), and the doctor's conclusion. It correctly identifies the one-week duration mentioned in the text. However, it fails to mention the reasoning provided in the gold answer for why it is not allergic or bacterial (e.g., lack of fever, clear discharge, lack of allergy history).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer. Specifically, it omits the 'absent features' (no cough, fever, sore throat) which are crucial for ruling out other causes. It also misses the discharge quality (clear), the exclusion of allergic triggers (no dust/fumes/animals), and the exposure history (nephew in daycare). It focuses only on the positive viral signs, covering roughly 40% of the comprehensive reasoning requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript. The claims about symptom type, evolution, and duration are supported by patient and doctor statements. It does not hallucinate information outside the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant. While it addresses the evidence for a viral infection, the prompt specifically asked for evidence supporting the conclusion 'rather than an allergic or bacterial cause.' The generated answer ignores the differential diagnosis aspect (ruling out alternatives), which was a core part of the question."
