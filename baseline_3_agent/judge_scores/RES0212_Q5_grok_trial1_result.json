  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links eczema as atopic marker increasing asthma/RAD risk for chronic cough, cat allergy supporting atopy and hyperresponsiveness (no cat exposure noted), vaping as irritant impairing defenses, combo lowering threshold for acute infection. Generated correctly identifies atopy from eczema/cat allergy and vaping irritant effect with synergy, but introduces errors: 'knowledge graph' citations (non-existent), incorrect KG link (cat allergy 'taken for' eczema), 'thinner skin barrier' (not in gold), 'acute bronchitis' diagnosis (gold says 'acute productive infection', no dx in gold/transcript), conflates smoking/vaping slightly. Main point of atopy + irritant susceptibility correct, but some factual errors/discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) eczema atopic marker -> asthma/RAD risk/chronic cough [P-22]; 2) cat allergy supports atopy, aeroallergen sens -> hyperresp/chronic cough, no cat exp [P-27, P-13-15]; 3) mj vaping irritants impair defenses/exacerbate sens [P-36/37]; 4) combo lowers threshold -> acute green sputum [P-9]; 5) no formal testing. Generated covers: atopy from eczema/cat allergy, vaping irritant, synergy/flare-up to productive cough, chronic/recurrent nature. Misses: specific asthma/RAD risk, no cat exp documentation, vaping impairs defenses detail, no testing note. Covers ~80% core points (atopy, irritant, combo effect).",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript citations [P-36, P-22, P-27, P-2, D-47, P-19] accurate for facts stated. However, hallucinates entire 'knowledge graph' with specific links (e.g., [LIFESTYLE_RISK] smoke/vape -> cough; cat allergy --[TAKEN_FOR]--> eczema – incorrect/missing; symptoms to acute bronchitis dx – no dx in transcript). 'Acute bronchitis' diagnosis fabricated (transcript describes symptoms, no formal dx). 'Thinner skin barrier' plausible but not verifiable in transcript. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly breaks down the three factors (vaping/mj, eczema, cat allergy), their individual impacts grounded in transcript, and collective synergy for chronic/recurrent symptoms, mirroring question focus. Minor tangent on 'acute bronchitis' still ties to symptom explanation; no off-topic content."
