  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer accurately states multivitamins only [P-40], notes pre-diabetes with glucose monitoring but no prescriptions [P-33,P-34,P-35]; allergy to penicillin [P-37]; reaction is rash [P-38] without breathing trouble [P-39]. Generated Answer correctly identifies multivitamins [P-40] and penicillin allergy [P-37], but falsely claims transcript does not specify reaction (ignores [P-38] rash), hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' and pre-diabetes management with multivitamins (not in transcript). Significant factual errors on reaction and hallucinations make it inconsistent with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: multivitamins only [P-40]; pre-diabetic monitoring no Rx [P-33]; no HTN/cholesterol [P-34,P-35]; penicillin allergy [P-37]; rash reaction no dyspnea [P-38,P-39]. Generated covers multivitamins and allergy; partially addresses pre-diabetes but inaccurately; completely misses reaction details and no HTN/cholesterol. Covers ~50-60% of key points (regimen and allergy yes, reaction no).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: multivitamins [P-40] and allergy [P-37] verifiable. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'Knowledge Graph' (absent); pre-diabetes managed with multivitamins (not stated, [P-33] only monitoring); transcript 'does not specify' reaction (directly contradicted by [P-38] 'I get a rash'). Multiple hallucinations and misrepresentations of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured perfectly around the three-part question (medication regimen, drug allergy, specific reaction), with no off-topic content or tangents; directly addresses query despite errors."
