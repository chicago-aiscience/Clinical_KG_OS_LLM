  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the three medical/occupational factors and explains their potential relationship to the cough in a manner consistent with the gold answer. It correctly cites the relevant transcript sections for acid reflux, hay fever, and occupation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all three factors requested in the prompt. Compared to the gold answer, it misses the specific point about the absence of pharmacologic treatment for reflux and the patient's anxiety and social motivation for seeking care. It also doesn't explicitly use the term 'post-viral' pattern, though it describes the resolution of other symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript, using specific markers like [P-22], [P-25], and [P-17] correctly. The clinical inferences made, such as airway irritation from reflux or pathogen load from the hospital environment, are plausible extensions of the documented history.",
    "relevance": "The response directly and exclusively addresses the question's focus on how the patient's documented history of acid reflux, hay fever, and occupation relate to the persistent cough."
