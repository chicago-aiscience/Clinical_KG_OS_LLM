  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient tried decongestants [P-10], captures the patient's assessment as 'working a little bit' with the implication of relieving stuffiness based on the nose becoming runny [P-10], which aligns with the Gold Answer's description of it being somewhat ambiguous but noting the 'little bit' help and reasoning. The doctor's recommendation of Tylenol Cold [D-39] matches. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) patient tried decongestants [P-10] - covered; (2) assessment 'helped a little bit' with reasoning about runny nose [P-10] - covered with similar detail; (3) doctor's rec: supportive care, hydrated, OTC like Tylenol Cold, takes weeks [D-39] - partially covered (Tylenol Cold yes, but misses hydration, weeks for resolution, and explicit supportive care/viral context). Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: decongestants and assessment quote/paraphrase from [P-10]; Tylenol cold from [D-39]. Interpretation of effectiveness grounded in patient's words ('my nose is runny now so that worked a little bit'). Citations accurate, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question (med tried, assessment, doctor's OTC rec) with no off-topic content."
