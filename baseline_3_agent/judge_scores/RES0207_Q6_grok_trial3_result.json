  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims there are no doctor turns in the transcript and that it only includes patient statements up to [P-26], which is false as the full transcript provided includes [D-1] to [D-38]. It fails to reference or accurately describe the key content in [D-37] and [D-38] that the Gold Answer correctly identifies, instead contradicting it by stating the next steps cannot be determined. This results in complete factual inaccuracy compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: doctor outlines next steps in [D-37]; will review with another doctor; will return shortly to discuss; possible tests and plan forward; collaborative decision-making; no specifics ordered; patient acknowledgment. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, as it denies the existence of the relevant transcript portions and provides no matching details.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript lacks all [D-X] turns and ends at [P-26], which is not verifiable and directly contradicts the provided source transcript including [D-37] and [D-38]. Inferences about medication and symptoms are grounded but irrelevant to the question and not presented as doctor's communication. Multiple fabrications about the transcript itself.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly engages the question by claiming it is impossible to answer due to an allegedly incomplete transcript, but then veers into off-topic clinical inferences not communicated by the doctor, failing to provide or even acknowledge the actual doctor's statements on next steps."
