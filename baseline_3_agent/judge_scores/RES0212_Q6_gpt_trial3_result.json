  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s end-of-visit plan (“go review your story with the doctors”) and the doctor’s summary assessment in D-47: longer-standing cough with worsening over the last ~3 days, nocturnal awakening, green sputum, and absence of constitutional symptoms. It does not introduce any contradictory or incorrect claims relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) plan to review story with the doctors, (2) summary of chronic cough with acute worsening, nighttime waking, greenish sputum, (3) explicit note of no constitutional symptoms, (4) next steps guided by review of history.\nMissing or less explicit vs Gold: (a) “no blood in it” is not stated in the Generated Answer, (b) the approximate 3-month duration is not explicitly mentioned (only “some time”), (c) the implication that this was a trainee presenting to a supervising physician is not stated, and (d) it does not explicitly note that no tests/imaging/treatment were ordered and that next steps depend on supervising physician assessment. Overall, it captures most but not all specific details from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are grounded in D-47 and consistent with the transcript. It does not claim tests, diagnoses, or next steps beyond what was stated. The phrasing about “reviewing the patient’s story…would guide the next steps” is a reasonable paraphrase of D-47 and does not add unsupported specifics.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all three parts of the question (plan, assessment, and what would guide next steps) without tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, well-grounded, and directly responsive, but it omits a few specific details emphasized in the Gold Answer (e.g., no blood, ~3-month duration, trainee/supervising physician implication, and explicit note that no tests/treatments were ordered)."
