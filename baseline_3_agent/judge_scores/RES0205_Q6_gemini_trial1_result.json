  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and perfectly aligns with the details provided in the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the source turn [D-37], the specific organs to be examined (heart and lungs), and the sequence of the doctor's process (consulting a colleague, reviewing info, and returning to the patient).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the primary components requested by the question and described in the Gold Answer: the physical exam (heart/lungs) and the follow-up process. It omits the contextual reference to turn [D-1] and the observation regarding the lack of diagnosis/medication mentioned in the Gold Answer, which accounts for the slightly lower score.",

    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses every part of the prompt without including unnecessary information. It is highly focused and efficient."
