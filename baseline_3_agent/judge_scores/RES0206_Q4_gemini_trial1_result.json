  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID) and the test (COVID swab) as specified in the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly asserts that the transcript contains no details regarding social contacts. This is a significant error because the Gold Answer (and transcript at P-20) explicitly mentions the patient meeting friends to walk dogs and one friend being sick.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the entire final segment of the question. It fails to provide the details about the friend being sick, the dog walking, and the proximity of their contact, all of which are included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucination of omission. By stating the transcript 'does not contain' information that is clearly present in speaker turn P-20, it fails to accurately reflect the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the first two parts of the question but provides a non-responsive and incorrect statement for the third part, failing to address that specific requirement of the prompt."
