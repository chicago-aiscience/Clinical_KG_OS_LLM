  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies hereditary risk (family history of epilepsy in mother [P-26]) consistent with patient's chronic epilepsy diagnosis, and medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose due to daughter's birthday [P-23, P-24, P-9], with normally infrequent seizures indicating good control). Generated Answer correctly identifies both risks with accurate citations but errs in the relation to diagnosis by claiming the recent seizure 'confirms' or 'establishes' the diagnosis ([P-8]), whereas the patient reports a pre-existing chronic condition ('I do have a seizure disorder I have epilepsy' [P-8], 'usually don't get seizures very often' [P-9]), making this a significant interpretive discrepancy.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) hereditary - epilepsy runs in family, mom had it [P-26/D-26]; 2) med - Keppra [P-23]; 3) missed due to birthday dinner disruption [P-24]; 4) patient links miss to seizure [P-9]; 5) seizures infrequent normally/well-controlled [P-9]; 6) combination of factors. Generated covers: hereditary mom [P-26], med Keppra miss linked to seizure [P-23/P-9], basic relation [P-8/P-26]; misses birthday reason [P-24], infrequency/control [P-9], clinician question [D-26], explicit combination (covers ~60-70% of key points).",
    "faithfulness": "All cited quotes ([P-23], [P-9], [P-26], [P-8]) are accurate and verifiable in transcript. Claims of non-adherence and family history directly grounded. However, assertion that 'seizure itself serves as clinical evidence confirming the diagnosis' and 'definitively establishes the medical history' is not supported by transcript (patient self-reports established epilepsy diagnosis), introducing a hallucinated interpretation.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured to directly address the question with sections on medication risk, hereditary risk, and relation to diagnosis, using transcript citations; no off-topic content."
