{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer: it identifies the clinician’s assessment that symptoms are consistent with COVID-19, specifies the two planned tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), and correctly states isolation until results return with continued isolation even if negative if symptoms persist. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer were found.",
    "completeness": "It covers all key elements asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer: overall assessment, both diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), isolation until results, and the condition for continued isolation (persistent symptoms despite a negative result). It omits the note about consulting the supervising physician/returning to discuss next steps, but that is peripheral to what the question explicitly requests.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript, primarily [D-43]. No hallucinated diagnoses, extra tests, or additional instructions are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested components (assessment, tests, isolation instructions, and criteria for continued isolation) with no tangential content."
