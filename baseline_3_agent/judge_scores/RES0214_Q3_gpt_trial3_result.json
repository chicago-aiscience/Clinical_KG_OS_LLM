  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies fever and sore throat as the key symptoms prompting concern for an infectious cause and COVID-19 workup (aligned with D-53). It also correctly states that lack of a flu shot led the clinician to consider influenza (D-53 to D-54). A minor discrepancy is framing COVID suspicion as based on exactly three symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat); while stuffy nose is present (P-1, D-24), the Gold Answer emphasizes fever+sore throat explicitly and also notes the broader viral cluster (including muscle aches) and household transmission context as part of the clinician’s reasoning.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: (1) fever and sore throat raising infectious/COVID concern; (2) no flu shot this year leading to influenza on the differential. Key Gold points missed/underemphasized: (1) the broader symptom cluster explicitly including muscle aches (D-24); (2) the epidemiologic context that the husband had similar symptoms and this drove COVID to be the first rule-out (D-53). Overall coverage is partial (~60–75%).",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims are supported by the transcript: fever/stuffy nose/sore throat in P-1, clinician’s statement about fever+sore throat and ordering COVID swab in D-53, flu shot question in D-53, negative response in P-53, and influenza possibility in D-54. No clear hallucinated symptoms or history are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements: (1) symptoms prompting infectious/COVID suspicion and (2) vaccination-history detail prompting influenza consideration. No meaningful tangents."
