  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately states the sequence from scratchy throat to dry cough per [P-4], matching Gold. It correctly describes feeling hot as concurrent and constant during the illness [P-1, P-7, P-9], alongside other symptoms, without specifying exact onset relative to throat/cough, aligning with Gold's note that timing is unspecified but part of the same illness. Doctor's summary as 'little bit of fever' [D-58] is exact. References head pounding and 'crappy' feeling, consistent with Gold. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: initial symptom (scratchy throat) then dry cough [P-4]; feeling hot as concurrent/constant, not before/after, doctor summary [D-58]. Mentions head pounding and 'crappy' [P-1]. Missed: explicit 3-4 day duration [P-1,P-3]; fatigue [P-13]; detailed hot sensations (night sweats denial, shorts/tank top [P-9]); malaise phrasing [P-14]; overall progression from localized to systemic. Covers core order and hot timeline (80-99%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: throat then cough [P-4]; hot feeling constant/day-night [P-7,P-9]; concurrent with cough/throat/crappy/head [P-1]; doctor summary [D-58]. Citations precise. 'Shortly thereafter' is reasonable inference from sequence without adding ungrounded details. No hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom order (throat -> cough) and progression; precisely explains hot sensation as concurrent/constant alongside cough/throat, not sequential. No off-topic content; focused on question."
