  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors: 1) It claims there was no reported acute trigger for the initial onset, whereas the transcript (P-3) and Gold Answer identify playing tag as the trigger. 2) It explicitly states the transcript does not detail a nocturnal episode, whereas the transcript (P-43, P-44) and Gold Answer provide specific details about a single episode involving wheeziness and trouble falling asleep.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover two major components requested in the prompt: the specific details of the nocturnal episode and the 'resolves with rest' aspect of the fluctuating pattern. It also misses the non-productive nature of the cough (no phlegm).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of information. By claiming the transcript 'does not explicitly detail' a nocturnal event, it ignores P-43 and P-44. This is a negative hallucination (denying existing evidence).",
    "relevance": "While the answer discusses the patient's symptoms and general history, it fails to provide the specific details requested regarding the nocturnal episode and the initial trigger, which were central to the question."
