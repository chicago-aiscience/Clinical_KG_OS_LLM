  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness) and the increased bronchodilator use as pointing to asthma worsening, aligning with the Gold Answer's main point. However, it has factual errors including inaccurate transcript citations (e.g., chest tightness cited as [P-4] and [P-9] instead of [P-20]; bronchodilator frequency increase linked to [P-9] instead of [P-8]), introduces a non-existent 'knowledge graph,' and misattributes some details like family history as confirmatory via the graph. Core facts are mostly consistent, but discrepancies exist.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: symptoms (dry cough [P-1/P-14], SOB [P-1], wheezing [P-15], chest tightness), bronchodilator relief [P-1], dramatic increase in use [P-8 via question reference], partial triggers (exercise/cold [P-9]). Missed key points from Gold: asthma diagnosis at age 8 [P-2/D-3], wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use [D-17/P-17], detailed screening negatives for infection (no colds [P-21], no sick contacts [P-22/P-23], no travel [P-24], no anosmia [P-25], no fever [P-26], no GI symptoms [P-27/P-28], dry cough confirmation [D-15/P-14]), need for medication adjustment [D-43]. Covers ~60-70% of key points, focusing on symptoms and use increase but omitting critical ruling-out of new conditions and diagnosis confirmation.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: symptoms verifiable (e.g., cough/SOB P-1, wheezing P-15). However, inaccurate citations (chest tightness P-4/P-9 incorrect; frequency P-9 wrong), hallucinated 'knowledge graph provided' with specific mappings not in transcript, and 'triad' framing plausible but not directly from transcript. Wheezing frequency implied but not detailed as in Gold. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements present.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by breaking down the specified symptoms and bronchodilator increase as evidence for asthma exacerbation over new condition, with focused structure and conclusion; no significant off-topic content."
