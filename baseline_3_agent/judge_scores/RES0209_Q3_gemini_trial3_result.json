  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness) and the increase in bronchodilator use. However, it contains factual errors regarding citations: it attributes the patient's confirmation of chest tightness to [P-4] and [P-9], whereas [P-4] is about inhaler use and [P-9] is about triggers. The correct citation is [P-20]. It also refers to a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not part of the provided source material.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a critical component of the Gold Answer: the exclusion of infectious etiologies. The Gold Answer explains why it is *not* a new respiratory condition by detailing the patient's negative responses to questions about fever, sick contacts, travel, and loss of taste/smell. The generated answer focuses only on the symptoms of asthma without addressing the 'rather than a new condition' aspect through the differential screening present in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information. It also incorrectly maps patient responses to specific transcript labels (e.g., misattributing the chest tightness confirmation).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant to the question asked, focusing on the specific symptoms and medication use mentioned in the prompt."
