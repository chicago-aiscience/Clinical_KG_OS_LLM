  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reproduces the core elements in [D-52]: COVID-19 swab with 24–48 hour turnaround, isolation for 14 days, and contact tracing if the test is positive, plus the listed supportive-care items (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, and Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). No statements directly contradict the Gold Answer. Minor wording nuance: it frames isolation as “while awaiting the test results,” whereas the transcript says “In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days,” which is slightly broader but not meaningfully incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points from the Gold Answer (test + turnaround time; 14-day isolation; contact tracing if positive; supportive care items). Misses two Gold Answer elements: (1) the doctor’s explicit note that if not COVID it could be “another viral illness… this time of year,” and (2) the explicit statement that no prescription medications were ordered beyond supportive measures / supportive care regardless of result.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly grounded in [D-52]. Two minor issues: (1) the phrase “Based on the transcript and knowledge graph” introduces an ungrounded element (no knowledge graph is in the transcript), and (2) “while awaiting the test results” is an inference rather than a verbatim condition, though consistent with the plan. Otherwise faithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by addressing the diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact-tracing trigger, and supportive care recommendations, with no substantive tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate and highly relevant, covering nearly all management-plan elements, but it omits the alternative viral-illness note and the explicit “no prescriptions/supportive regardless” detail, and includes a minor ungrounded reference to a knowledge graph."
