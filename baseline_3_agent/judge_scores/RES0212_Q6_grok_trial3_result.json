  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the doctor's summary assessment (cough for some time but severe last 3 days, nighttime coughing, greenish sputum, no constitutional symptoms), stated plan (review story with doctors), and guiding information (review of patient's story), directly matching the Gold Answer's key facts from [D-47] without any factual errors or contradictions, though it omits interpretive details like specific 3-month duration, implications for serious illness, trainee context, and lack of tests.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: doctor's plan (review story), summary assessment details (duration/severity, night waking, sputum color/type, no constitutional symptoms), guiding info (patient's story/history). Missed: explicit 3-month reference, 'no blood' detail, lowering concern for TB/malignancy with patient denial links, trainee/supervising MD role, patient addition about exercise, doctor's 'we'll see what we can do', explicit no tests/treatments; covers ~85% of Gold's elaborated points but fully addresses the question's three components.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-47] of the transcript: plan to 'review your story with the doctors', cough 'for a little while' but 'only become bad in the last three days', 'waking up at night', 'bringing up this... greenish sputum, but... no blood in it', 'no constitutional symptoms'; no hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured with bullet points precisely matching the three-part question (plan, summary assessment, guiding info), with no off-topic content or tangents."
