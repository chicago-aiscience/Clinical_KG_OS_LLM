  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the bullseye rash as assessed and absent [D-6, P-6], and accurately notes localized redness/tenderness without it. Diagnostic tests like tick identification [D-18], blood serology [D-18], and physical exam [D-18] are correctly stated, though citation for blood work incorrectly includes D-6 (which discusses antibiotics, not blood). However, it omits key assessed features from Gold (joint pain [D-7/P-7], fever/illness [D-8/P-8], headaches [D-19/P-19-20], feeling well [D-18/P-18], no other bites [P-9]) and supervising physician consult [D-13/D-22], leading to significant discrepancies in completeness of clinical features.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: bullseye rash (yes), tick species ID (yes), blood serology (yes), physical exam (yes). Missed: joint pain, fever/systemic illness, headaches, feeling well otherwise, no other bites, physician consult, note on no test results. Covers ~25-30% of Gold's key points (1/6 clinical + 3/4 diagnostics).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in transcript: bullseye inquiry/denial [D-6/P-6], bite symptoms [P-1/P-6], tick ID [D-18], blood work [D-18], physical exam [D-18]. Minor issue: citation D-6 for blood work is inaccurate (actual in D-18 only), but claim itself grounded; no hallucinations or fabricated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the two-part question (clinical features absent, diagnostic tests proposed), uses transcript citations, no off-topic content or tangents."
