  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect regarding the source text. It claims that there are no doctor turns and that the transcript ends at [P-26], whereas the provided transcript contains 38 doctor turns and clearly outlines the next steps at the end (D-37, D-38).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer, such as the involvement of a second doctor, the mention of potential tests, or the timeline for returning to the patient.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a limitation in the source text that does not exist. It states the transcript 'consists exclusively of patient statements' and 'cuts off,' which is directly contradicted by the provided content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question because it erroneously concludes that the necessary information is missing from the transcript."
