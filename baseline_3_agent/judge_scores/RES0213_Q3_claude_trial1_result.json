  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer provides a factually correct diagnosis of anxiety-related chest pain, which aligns with the Gold Answer's conclusion of 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' However, it uses slightly different terminology ('Functional Chest Pain' or 'Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain' vs the Gold Answer's phrasing). The core medical reasoning is sound and consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers several key supporting points from the Gold Answer including: academic stress/thesis pressure, history of anxiety attacks as a teenager, breathing changes related to nervousness, and patient's own attribution to stress. However, it misses critical observations present in the Gold Answer: (1) the crucial situational pattern that pain occurs when alone but resolves when distracted/engaged with others, (2) pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, occurs at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety, no asthma), and (3) specific transcript citations for the situational pattern [P-4, P-9, P-29]. These omissions represent approximately 40-50% of the Gold Answer's key supporting evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is generally faithful to the transcript with accurate citations. However, there is one problematic statement: the answer claims the patient 'reports experiencing shortness of breath' when the transcript actually shows the patient denying intrinsic breathing difficulty ('I don't have a hard time breathing otherwise' [P-19]). The patient only notes breathing faster due to nervousness, not true shortness of breath. This represents a subtle but clinically important mischaracterization of the patient's symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying the diagnosis and providing supporting clinical observations from the consultation. All content is relevant to answering what diagnosis the findings point toward and which observations support this reasoning. The answer stays focused on the clinical question without tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety-related chest pain as the diagnosis and provides several valid supporting observations including academic stress, anxiety history, and patient attribution. However, it misses critical evidence from the Gold Answer, particularly the situational pattern of symptoms (occurring when alone, resolving when distracted) and important pertinent negatives. Additionally, it contains a minor but clinically significant mischaracterization by stating the patient 'reports experiencing shortness of breath' when she actually denied intrinsic breathing difficulty. Despite these limitations, the answer remains relevant and demonstrates sound clinical reasoning aligned with the Gold Answer's conclusion."
