  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the patient denied smell loss and admitted to a sore throat, swallowing difficulties, and muscle aches. However, it fails to mention the majority of negative findings from the transcript, including the denial of cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills, and night sweats. It also misses the patient's denial of travel and sick contacts.",
    "completeness": "The response is highly incomplete, covering less than 20% of the negative findings listed in the Gold Answer. It omits the clinical reasoning regarding the exclusion of typical upper respiratory infections and the significance of the absence of chest pain in the context of breathing difficulties.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer repeatedly cites a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source materials. This represents a hallucination of external data. It also incorrectly implies that the doctor only screened for a narrow set of COVID-19 indicators, whereas the transcript shows a much broader systematic screening.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question's prompt but fails to extract the relevant data from the provided transcript, instead relying on a single symptom and hallucinated external information."
