  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the respiratory symptoms reported at presentation: wheezing, shortness of breath/out of breath, and slight cough (all in P-1; out of breath with activity in P-3). It also correctly includes “difficulty taking in deep breaths” (P-2), which is part of the early symptom description.\n\nHowever, it is incorrect about which symptoms were earliest at onset. The transcript explicitly answers this in P-2: earliest were wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths. The Generated Answer instead concludes that wheeze, cough, and shortness of breath were “all understood to have been present since the issue started,” which contradicts the Gold Answer’s supported interpretation that cough appeared later (“and now she has a slight cough” in P-1) and that the earliest symptoms were wheeze + difficulty deep breaths (P-2). This is a clinically/materially important error because it misstates the symptom timeline asked in the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer:\n- At presentation: wheezy (4–5 days), slight cough, a little short of breath (P-1). ✅ covered\n- Exertional component: “quite out of breath” playing tag (P-3). ✅ covered (via P-3)\n- Earliest symptoms 4–5 days ago: wheezy + difficulty taking deep breaths (P-2). ⚠️ partially covered (lists them but does not correctly label these as the earliest; incorrectly extends earliest set to include cough/SOB)\n- Additional episode detail: hard time catching breath; no cyanosis (P-32). ❌ missed\n- Cough non-productive/no phlegm (P-31). ❌ missed\n- “Looks fine otherwise” (P-9). ❌ missed (not respiratory but included in Gold context)\n\nOverall, it captures the main symptom list but omits several Gold details and, more importantly, fails to correctly present the onset/earliest-symptom distinction.",
    "faithfulness": "Most symptom statements are directly supported by cited transcript lines (P-1, P-2, P-3). However, the claim that cough and shortness of breath were present since the very start (4–5 days ago) is not stated in the transcript and conflicts with the direct onset description (P-2) and the “and now she has a slight cough” phrasing (P-1). This represents an unsupported inference/hallucinated timeline element. Apart from that, the answer remains generally grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question: it lists the respiratory symptoms reported and attempts to identify which were earliest at onset. There are no major tangents. The main issue is accuracy of the onset subset rather than relevance."
