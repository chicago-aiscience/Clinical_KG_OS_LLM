{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly correct but contains a minor factual inaccuracy in stating there is 'no mention' of prior symptoms; the transcript explicitly records the patient denying prior symptoms (P-3), which is a specific mention. It correctly identifies the simultaneous onset and the consistent nature of the cough.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention that the loss of taste and smell were also 'pretty consistent' (P-5), only addressing the cough. It also omits the details about the partial nature of the sensory loss (smelling strong odors and tasting salty foods), which characterizes the symptom state over time.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes a hallucinated reference to a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the provided source materials. Otherwise, the claims are grounded in the transcript, though the 'no mention' phrasing is a slight mischaracterization of the explicit negative history provided.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question regarding onset, progression, and history."
