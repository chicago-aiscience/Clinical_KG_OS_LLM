  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the doctor wanted to rule out COVID-19 because the patient’s symptoms overlapped with COVID-19 (consistent with D-52). It also correctly identifies loss of smell as the symptom particularly characteristic of COVID-19 (supported by P-24). The symptom cluster it lists (headache, cough, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea) is accurate per P-1/P-28/P-32, though it omits some qualifying details present in the Gold Answer (e.g., dry cough, persistent headache, fatigue). No incorrect symptoms are added.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) doctor explicitly says COVID is first to rule out due to overlap; (2) constellation includes dry cough, persistent headache, GI symptoms (n/v/diarrhea), fatigue, and notable loss of smell; (3) anosmia is particularly characteristic; (4) mentions alternative viral illness consideration; (5) pertinent negatives (no fever, no runny/stuffy nose, no myalgias). Generated Answer includes (1) and (3) and most of (2) via headache+cough+GI symptoms, but misses fatigue and the dry/persistent qualifiers, does not include anosmia as part of the initial constellation (it’s separated as the characteristic symptom), and omits the alternative diagnosis and pertinent negatives. Overall coverage is substantial but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made are supported by the transcript: the symptom cluster is in P-1/P-28/P-32, the doctor’s rationale is in D-52, and loss of smell is in P-24. The added bracketed semantic link (“[SYMPTOM] smell loss --[INDICATES]--> …”) is stylistic and does not introduce new factual content beyond what is stated. No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question: (a) which symptom combination prompted ruling out COVID-19 and (b) which symptom is particularly characteristic of COVID-19. No notable irrelevant content."
