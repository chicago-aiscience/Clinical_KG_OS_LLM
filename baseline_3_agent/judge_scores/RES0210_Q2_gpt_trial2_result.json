  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies Lipitor as the patient’s prescribed medication for high cholesterol and correctly reports the OTC medication as Tylenol with the patient stating it “helps a little bit.” However, it contains factual inaccuracies/overreach: it paraphrases the transcript as the patient saying they “haven’t taken” Tylenol (the transcript strongly implies he has taken it), and it asserts Tylenol was used for “sore throat” and “chest pain,” which is not stated in the transcript/Gold Answer (Gold supports use for feeling feverish/unwell).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: Lipitor for cholesterol; Tylenol OTC; Tylenol provided only partial relief (“helps a little bit”). Key points missed/understated: confirmation that Lipitor is the only prescription medication and that no other OTC meds were mentioned. (The Gold Answer also notes expectorating sputum as a non-medication measure, but that is not required by the question.)",
    "faithfulness": "Parts are grounded (Lipitor for cholesterol; Tylenol helps a little). But the answer introduces unsupported elements (“knowledge graph indicates…,” and Tylenol treating sore throat/chest pain) that are not in the transcript, and it slightly misquotes the Tylenol-taking statement. This reflects some hallucination/unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications, indications, and OTC effectiveness, with only minor irrelevant framing (“knowledge graph”) and minimal extraneous content."
