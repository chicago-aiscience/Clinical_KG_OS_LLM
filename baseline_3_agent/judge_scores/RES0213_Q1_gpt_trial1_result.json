  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes the pain is described as “very sharp”/“strong” and that episodes last ~20 minutes, and that OTC meds (Tylenol/Advil/Alka-Seltzer) did not help. However, it contains major factual errors compared with the Gold Answer/transcript: it does not state the key feature that the pain is sharp specifically **when taking a deep breath** (pleuritic component). It incorrectly attributes occurrence to “stress and anxiety” as a trigger and, more seriously, claims the pain is “exclusive to episodes of anxiety attacks” based on [P-20], but [P-20] is about palpitations/heart flutter during anxiety attacks, not the chest pain itself. It also misses/incorrectly represents the situational pattern (alone walking/studying vs distracted/social). The citation “[P-1]” is also incorrect (P-1 is just “Chest pain.”).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) sharp/strong quality; (2) ~20-minute episodes; (3) OTC analgesics tried without much help (extra detail not required by the question but true). Key points missed: (1) symptoms present for ~1.5 weeks; (2) pain occurs specifically with deep inspiration; (3) intermittent “here and there,” several times/day; (4) occurs while sitting studying or walking to school, especially when alone; (5) tends to resolve/go unnoticed when at school talking to people/doing other tasks; (6) can occur at rest; (7) not worse with exercise; (8) no prior similar pain. Overall coverage is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s key characteristics asked in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript or are misinterpretations: attributing the pain to stress/anxiety as a specific trigger is stronger than the patient’s tentative speculation, and the claim that pain is “exclusive to anxiety attacks” is contradicted by the transcript (pain occurs when walking/studying alone; [P-20] refers to palpitations). Some citations are inaccurate (e.g., [P-1]). While some elements (20-minute duration; meds not helping) are faithful, there are multiple unfaithful claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address quality, duration, triggers, and resolution contexts, so it is on-topic. However, it emphasizes anxiety/stress material and misstates the occurrence/resolution pattern, omitting the key situational contexts and deep-breath association. Still, most content is at least related to the chest-pain history, so relevance is partial rather than absent."

  "summary": "The response is partially on-topic but misses multiple core chest-pain characteristics from the transcript (deep-breath pleuritic quality; alone vs distracted pattern; 1.5-week duration) and introduces major inaccuracies about anxiety being the exclusive trigger, resulting in low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness."
