{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the cough transition from productive to dry and the chest discomfort associated with coughing. It correctly attributes the timeline for the productive phase (4-5 days) and the persistence of the cough (2 weeks).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is significantly incomplete. It misses several key 'resolved symptoms' explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript, such as sore throat [P-13] and runny nose/flu symptoms [P-14]. It also omits all descriptions of the current cough's frequency (3-4 times/hour), triggers (spontaneous), and stability in intensity. Furthermore, it does not mention the pertinent negatives (fever, dyspnea, etc.) which are typically included in comprehensive clinical symptom reporting.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript. The distinction between the early productive phase and the later dry phase is well-supported by [P-5] and [P-6].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the prompt's request for resolved and current symptoms. However, by listing 'Cough' and 'Dry Cough' as two separate items, it is slightly redundant, though both are technically relevant to the patient's report."
