  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the main respiratory symptoms (wheezy, difficulty taking deep breaths, out of breath/shortness of breath, slight cough) matching the transcript and Gold, with correct citations. However, it has a significant factual error compared to Gold by claiming all symptoms (including cough) were present since the 4-5 day onset, whereas Gold correctly notes cough as more recent ('and now' in [P-1]) and specifies wheezing + difficulty deep breaths as earliest per [P-2]. It misses nuances like non-productive cough and no cyanosis. Thus, significant discrepancies on timeline and earliest symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Covers key symptoms from Gold (wheezy [P-1,P-2], SOB/out of breath [P-1,P-3], cough [P-1], difficulty deep breaths [P-2]). Misses: precise earliest distinction (only wheezing + deep breaths per [P-2]), cough recent/non-productive [P-1,P-31], hard time catching breath/no cyanosis [P-32], looks fine [P-9]. Covers ~60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All listed symptoms and citations ([P-1],[P-2],[P-3]) are directly verifiable in transcript. However, the conclusion that 'all symptoms... present since the issue started' based on wheezy duration is an ungrounded inference/hallucination, as [P-1] distinguishes cough as 'now' and [P-2] specifies only wheezy + deep breaths first; plausible but inaccurate synthesis.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses both parts of the question: lists specific symptoms at presentation with citations, then directly discusses earliest symptoms with reasoning tied to onset timeline. No irrelevant content or tangents."
