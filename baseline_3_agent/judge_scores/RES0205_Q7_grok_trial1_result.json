  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on the two-week onset of flu-like symptoms resolving in 3-4 days, productive cough with whitish clear mucus for first 4-5 days, transition to persistent dry cough after that, and chest soreness from coughing. Minor discrepancies include not stating cough intensity remained 'kind of the same' or frequency stable at 3-4 times/hour with no triggers, and characterizing frequency as 'high' (subjective, not in Gold/transcript); core timeline facts are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: illness onset two weeks ago with flu-like symptoms [P-2,14]; initial flu symptoms (implied sore throat/runny nose) for 2-3 days resolving in 3-4 days [P-13,14]; mucus whitish clear for 4-5 days [P-6]; transition to dry cough after day 4-5 [P-5,6]; persistent dry cough; chest soreness [P-15,16]. Missed: explicit sore throat/runny nose breakdown, cough intensity unchanged [P-7], frequency stable/not increased at ~3-4x/hour/spontaneous [P-8-10], no fevers [P-12], COVID test negative [P-35,36]. Covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims grounded: flu onset/resolution [P-13,14], mucus details/transition [P-6], dry cough persistence [P-2,5,6], chest soreness [P-15]; citations accurate. Minor issues: 'frequency remained high' interpretive (P-9: 3-4/hr, not explicitly 'high'), 'acute viral symptoms' plausible inference from flu-like but not verbatim. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response is perfectly structured as a timeline focusing on symptom onset, progression, mucus production, cough transition, resolution of other symptoms, and cough effects, directly addressing all elements of the question without irrelevant content or tangents."
