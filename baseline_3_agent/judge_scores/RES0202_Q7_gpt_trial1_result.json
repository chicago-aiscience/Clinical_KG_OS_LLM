  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly reconstructs the day-by-day timeline: cough begins Wednesday night as a mild dry cough; persists Thursday with worsening and tiredness; worsens further Friday with first fever >100°F and decreased appetite/suspected taste change. Minor issues: it implies possible breathing struggle on Friday (P-8 is speculative and not a confirmed new symptom), and it adds extraneous material (doctor’s inquiries, COVID swab/isolation) not required by the question.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: cough onset Wednesday evening/night; cough worsening over Thurs→Fri; fatigue emerging by Thursday and persisting; fever first appearing on Friday with ~100.1–101°F; decreased appetite and suspected taste change on Friday. Missed: mild runny nose on Friday (P-16) and the explicit correction that symptoms were ~3 days not 5 days (P-4), which helps frame the evolution window. It also does not explicitly restate the mother’s stepwise summary in P-12 (though it conveys the same progression).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by cited transcript lines (P-1, P-15, P-17). The ‘perhaps struggling slightly with breathing’ is only a parental speculation and not a documented symptom; otherwise no major hallucinations. The added COVID testing/isolation advice is present in the transcript (D-44) but is not part of the asked timeline.",
    "relevance": "Mostly answers the question (day-by-day evolution, cough severity changes, fever and systemic symptoms onset). Some irrelevant additions (doctor’s questioning about chest pain/heart racing; COVID swab/isolation recommendations) dilute focus but do not overwhelm the core response."

  "summary": "The answer is largely accurate and grounded with a correct day-by-day timeline, but it misses a couple of Gold details (runny nose, explicit 3-day correction) and includes minor speculative/irrelevant additions."
