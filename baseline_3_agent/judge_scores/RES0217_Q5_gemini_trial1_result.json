  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly interprets the logic for the 72-hour duration calculation based on the Friday and Saturday timeline. However, it is factually incorrect regarding the second part of the question. It explicitly denies that the transcript contains information about the 'Ontario Lyme disease distribution map' or Strathroy's position, whereas the Gold Answer and the transcript (at turn D-13) clearly state the doctor used this map to identify Strathroy as a 'concerning point'.",
    "completeness": "The answer only provides half of the required information. While it explains the activity timeline for the 72-hour estimate, it fails to provide the geographic justification, claiming the information is not present in the text. It misses about 50% of the key points required by the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a negative hallucination. It claims evidence is missing from the transcript when turn [D-13] explicitly says: 'I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario... Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point'. By stating this does not exist, the answer is unfaithful to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant as it attempts to address both specific parts of the question directly, even though the content provided for the second part is incorrect."
