  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the systemic symptoms. It claims the doctor did not screen for fever, joint pain, or headaches and that the patient's denial is not in the text. In reality, the transcript explicitly shows the doctor asking about joint pain ([D-7]), fever ([D-8]), and headaches ([D-19]), all of which the patient denied.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first half of the question (local symptoms) well. It fails completely on the second half (systemic symptoms), providing incorrect information instead of the points found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates a failure to ground itself in the provided transcript. It explicitly states that information is missing ('the transcript does not contain evidence') when that information is clearly present in segments D-7, D-8, and D-19.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in that it attempts to address both parts of the question, but the quality is severely impacted by the inaccuracy of the systemic symptom section."
