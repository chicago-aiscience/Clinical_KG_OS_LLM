  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s medication for epilepsy (matches Gold: P-23, P-8). For the second part, it states the patient missed a dose because they “forgot,” which is true (P-9), but it fails to provide the *specific circumstance* (daughter’s birthday/changed dinner routine) that the Gold Answer specifies. So the core idea is not wrong, but it is overly generic relative to what was asked and what the Gold contains.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) Keppra for epilepsy. Partially covers: (2) missed dose due to forgetting. Misses key Gold detail: the concrete circumstance—daughter’s birthday celebration, earlier celebration, no usual dinner routine leading to forgetting (P-24). Also omits that it was an isolated situational lapse and that the patient linked the missed dose to the seizure (P-9), though these are secondary to the question. Overall coverage is well under 50% of the key circumstance detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (Keppra: P-23; forgot med: P-9). No extra or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The response addresses both components of the question (medication and why a dose was missed), but the second component is insufficiently specific for what the question asks. Still, it stays on-topic with no tangents."
