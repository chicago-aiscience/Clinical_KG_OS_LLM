{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the two diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) and provides the correct rationale for the COVID swab as found in the transcript (standard practice for patients with those symptoms). All clinical facts align with the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer addresses both parts of the question: the procedures and the specific rationale for the COVID swab. It is slightly less detailed than the gold answer, omitting the doctor's description of the X-ray as a 'picture of your body' and the patient's lack of medication history, though the latter was provided as a condition in the prompt rather than a requirement for the response body.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer correctly cites turns D-37 and D-39. However, it mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is not present in the source transcript or the provided context, representing a minor hallucination regarding the data source, even if the clinical content itself is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific questions asked without adding excessive unnecessary information."
