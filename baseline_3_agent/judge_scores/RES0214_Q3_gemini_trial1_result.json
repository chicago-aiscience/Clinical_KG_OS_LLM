  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer regarding the primary symptoms (fever, sore throat, stuffy nose) and the specific reason for the influenza differential (lack of flu shot). It correctly identifies the relevant transcript segments.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two nuances mentioned in the gold answer: 1) the epidemiological context regarding the husband's similar symptoms being a reason to suspect COVID-19, and 2) 'muscle aches' as part of the broader symptom cluster. It covers the core requirements of the question but is less comprehensive than the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited. There is no evidence of hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question, providing clear evidence for both parts of the query."
