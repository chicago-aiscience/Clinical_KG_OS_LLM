  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the onset as three days ago [P-1] and first noticing during dog walk [P-1/P-4]. It accurately describes tightness on inspiration and harder breathing [P-1/P-5]. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly mention if symptoms are getting better, worse, or staying the same (directly contradicted by P-2: 'staying the same' and P-3: 'pretty steady'). It partially covers exacerbators (walking) but misses getting up from chair and big breaths [P-9]. It misrepresents impact on walking routine as continuing unchanged, ignoring reduction from multiple to one walk daily [P-22]. Adds unrelated hoarseness [P-11]. Misinterprets D-36 on exercise SOB. Significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: onset 3 days (covered), first on dog walk (partial), no specific trigger/just came on (missed), staying same/steady (missed), always there but worse with walks/up from chair/big breath (partial: only walks), on inspiration (covered), reduced to one walk/day usually couple (missed, says continues), no missed work (missed), noticeably limiting (missed). Covers ~30-40% (onset, partial triggers, inspiration).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: 3 days/tightness/breathing/walking [P-1,4,5,9]. Hoarseness verifiable [P-11]. But 'trend not explicitly stated' is false (P-2/P-3). 'Continues daily routine' overlooks reduction [P-22]. D-36 citation on no SOB with exercise is doctor's paraphrase but patient reported harder breath [P-7]; plausible but adds unverifiable spin. Multiple misreads/hallucinations on key absences.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures around onset, nature, triggers, trend, impact, aligning with question on development/evolution, first activity, progression, exacerbators, walking routine. Minor tangents (hoarseness, D-36 spin) but mostly focused."
