  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer captures the general trend of worsening symptoms but fails to include the specific quantitative facts found in the Gold Answer and requested by the prompt, such as the initial diagnosis age (eight), the baseline frequency (once every two weeks), and the current frequency (five to six times per week). It also contains a citation error: it attributes chest tightness to [P-4] (which discusses medication type) instead of [P-20].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the age of diagnosis (8) and current age (10), the specific baseline frequency of inhaler use, the specific current frequency of use, the presence of nighttime symptoms, and the fact that wheezing episodes are more frequent than inhaler usage.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript, but there is a hallucinated citation link where chest tightness is attributed to [P-4] instead of [P-20]. It also refers to a '[Knowledge Graph] inference' which is not part of the source text provided.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but lacks the specific temporal structure requested in the prompt. The prompt specifically asked for the evolution 'from initial diagnosis... through baseline... to current exacerbation,' but the response focuses mostly on current symptoms and general increases without the chronological milestones."
