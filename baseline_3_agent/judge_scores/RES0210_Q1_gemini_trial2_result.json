  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it attributes the 'raw' feeling to the patient's chest, whereas the transcript and gold answer clearly state it was a sore throat that felt raw (P-15). It also misses the primary color of the sputum (yellow custard), only mentioning the red spots.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details present in the gold answer: the 'yellow custard' sputum description, the 'dull' and 'constant' quality of the chest pain, the timeline of symptom onset, the presence of mild dyspnea on exertion (climbing stairs), and the history of a runny nose.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer misinterprets the transcript regarding the location of the 'raw' sensation. While it cites P-15, the transcript specifically links that sensation to a sore throat, not chest pain. Other claims are grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question asked, addressing sputum, chest pain, and systemic symptoms, though it lacks the required depth and accuracy in those descriptions."
