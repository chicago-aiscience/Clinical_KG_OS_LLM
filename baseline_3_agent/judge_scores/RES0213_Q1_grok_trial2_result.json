  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer specifies quality as initially 'uncomfortable/odd' evolving to 'very sharp, strong pain' specifically on deep breath; Generated captures 'sharp/strong/same each time' but omits deep breath trigger and initial description, introducing 'localized in chest' not emphasized. Duration of episodes matches (20 min). Situations: Gold details occur alone (walking to school/studying), resolve when social/engaged; Generated reframes as stress/workload/anxiety attacks, misquoting P-20 (refers to heart flutter, not pain) as pain exclusive to anxiety attacks—significant contradiction/hallucination. Misses no worsening with exercise, at rest, total 1.5 weeks duration, no injury, first episode. Core characteristics distorted by incorrect causal attribution. Significant factual errors/contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1.5 weeks total (missed); uncomfortable/odd initially (missed); sharp/strong on deep breath (partial, misses deep breath); 20 min intermittent episodes (covered); occur alone walking/studying (partial via stress inference, not direct); resolve when social/engaged (vague 'context-dependent'); at rest (missed); no worse exercise (missed); no injury/first time (missed). Covers ~30% (duration, partial quality/situations); <50%.",
    "faithfulness": "Quality claims verifiable [P-3,P-6]; duration verifiable [P-6]; stress mentions verifiable [P-8,P-15,P-16] but not directly as pain trigger. P-19 nervousness verifiable but SOB not primary. Major issue: P-20 misquoted ('that' = heart flutter, not pain); hallucinated 'exclusive to anxiety attacks', 'pain does not occur at any other time'. Adds unverified 'localized in chest'. Multiple hallucinated/misinterpreted claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around quality, duration, occurrence/resolution as asked; adds stress details and meds (minor tangents) but stays focused on pain characteristics without major off-topic content."
