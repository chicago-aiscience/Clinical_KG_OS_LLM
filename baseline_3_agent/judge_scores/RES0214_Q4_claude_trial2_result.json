    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53]. However, the rationale section contains significant errors. While it mentions symptoms and clinical reasoning, it fails to emphasize the household transmission pattern (husband's symptoms for past week) as the primary epidemiological rationale stated in the Gold Answer. The Generated Answer incorrectly attributes the prioritization to 'clinical symptoms and potential exposure' rather than the specific household transmission pattern that the doctor explicitly cited as the key reason.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers about 60% of the Gold Answer's key points. It correctly identifies the diagnostic test and provides some rationale, but misses critical elements: (1) the specific household transmission timeline (husband sick for a week first), (2) the explicit doctor's statement about household transmission being the reason for prioritizing COVID ('if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing'), (3) the self-isolation instruction as evidence of urgency, and (4) the temporal sequence of influenza being mentioned only after COVID discussion and learning about no flu shot.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it makes some inferential leaps not directly supported by the text. The claim that 'the Knowledge Graph supports this prioritization by linking these specific symptoms to covid' is not verifiable in the provided transcript. The reference to 'likely became infected via the husband' is an inference, though reasonable. The core claims about the COVID swab and the doctor's statements are accurate with proper citations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the diagnostic test ordered and the rationale for prioritizing COVID-19. However, it provides a weaker version of the rationale by focusing on general symptoms rather than the specific epidemiological reasoning (household transmission pattern) that the doctor actually emphasized. The content is on-topic but misses the most relevant aspect of the doctor's reasoning."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with proper citation but provides an incomplete and somewhat inaccurate rationale. While it captures that COVID-19 was prioritized, it focuses on general symptom presentation rather than the specific household transmission pattern that the doctor explicitly cited as the primary reason. Key missing elements include the temporal sequence of the husband's illness, the doctor's explicit statement about household transmission, self-isolation instructions, and the mention of influenza only after COVID-19 discussion. The answer is generally faithful to the transcript but makes some unverifiable claims about a 'Knowledge Graph' not present in the source material."
