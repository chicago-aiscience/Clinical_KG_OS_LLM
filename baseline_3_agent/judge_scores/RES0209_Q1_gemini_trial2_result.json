  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain specific details regarding nighttime symptom frequency. However, the transcript (P-18) explicitly mentions that nighttime symptoms occur 'every other day' or 'every two days or so'. Additionally, it misses the correction that the cough has lasted for two weeks (P-13), instead sticking to the initial 'week or so' mentioned in P-1.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer identifies the four main symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness) but fails to provide the specific frequency for nighttime symptoms requested by the prompt. It also omits the specific two-week duration highlighted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a 'hallucination of absence' by claiming the transcript lacks information about nighttime symptoms when that information is clearly present in turn P-18. This is a failure to ground the response in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address all parts of the question, but the final section fails to provide the requested comparison by incorrectly asserting the data is unavailable."
