  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core respiratory symptoms (increased cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea) and key systemic symptoms (feverish feeling, sinus pressure) from the Gold Answer and transcript, with correct citations; minor discrepancies include omitting reduced exercise tolerance [P-4] and mild headache [P-14], but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: increased cough [P-1], sputum [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], dyspnea/SOB [P-1], fever [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12], most bothersome cough [P-12] (7/9 main positive symptoms); missed: reduced exercise tolerance [P-4], headache [P-14], and pertinent negatives (but negatives are supplementary, not core reported symptoms), covering ~80% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-9, P-12]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details; phrasing like 'significant shortness of breath' is grounded in 'really hard to breathe' [P-1].",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by categorizing respiratory and systemic symptoms from the 3-day period and explicitly identifying the most bothersome symptom (cough), with no off-topic content."
