  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer regarding the patient's history and symptoms. Both identify the role of seasonal allergies as a predisposition, the historical viral infections as a source of respiratory sensitivity, and cold weather and carpets as triggers. The generated answer accurately cites the transcript for these points.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all four specific factors requested in the prompt. However, it is slightly less comprehensive than the gold answer because it omits the secondary environmental factors that were ruled out (smoking, pets, wood-burning stoves), which the gold answer uses to strengthen the clinical profile. It also simplifies the medical mechanism (atopic constitution and airway hyperresponsiveness) compared to the gold answer's more nuanced explanation.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer correctly identifies details from the transcript (e.g., 6-month-old carpets, Reactine use, 2-year history of infections). However, it repeatedly references a 'Knowledge Graph' to justify clinical connections (e.g., 'Knowledge Graph confirms that viral infection [CAUSES] wheezy'). This 'Knowledge Graph' is not part of the provided source transcript, constituting a minor structural hallucination, even if the medical logic is sound.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and exclusively addresses the question asked, focusing on the four specific factors and how they relate to the current exercise-induced symptoms. It follows a logical structure and avoids significant tangents."
