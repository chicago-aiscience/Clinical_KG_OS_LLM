  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the main symptoms (cough, sputum, fever, chills, and chest pain) and the diagnosis. However, it makes a significant error by attributing the 'raw' feeling described in P-15—which the transcript clearly links to a sore throat—to pleuritic chest pain. The Gold Answer correctly identifies the pleuritic nature via P-18 and P-19.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two key points present in the Gold Answer: the dyspnea on exertion (which was explicitly mentioned in the prompt's premise) and the patient's smoking history as a predisposing factor. It covers about 60% of the relevant evidence categories.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates a connection between P-15 and chest pain. In the transcript, P-15 is a response to a question about a sore throat, not chest pain. Using this to explain the mechanism of pleurisy is a misinterpretation of the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally relevant to the question of identifying pneumonia, but it fails to address the 'dyspnea on exertion' finding that was specifically highlighted in the prompt's question."
