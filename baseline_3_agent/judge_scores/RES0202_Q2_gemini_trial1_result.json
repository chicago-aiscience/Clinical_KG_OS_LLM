  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID swab test, the 24-48 hour window for results, the 14-day isolation period, and the younger sister as the specific contact to isolate from. It also accurately details the ER precautions.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the specific points requested in the question. Compared to the gold answer, it misses the mention of the school's testing requirement, the possibility of false-negative results, and the fact that no medications were prescribed.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript, specifically referencing D-44 and D-45. The mention of asthma as a differential diagnosis is based on the doctor's explanation in D-45, though the doctor noted it was less likely due to the fever.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing every part of the prompt's specific requirements (diagnostic tests, isolation duration, and household contact) without irrelevant filler."
