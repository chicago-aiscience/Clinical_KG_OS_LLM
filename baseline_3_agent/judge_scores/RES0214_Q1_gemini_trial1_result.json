  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle aches) and the five specific symptoms to be denied. However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the nature of the denials. It claims the patient 'did not report' or 'implied' a lack of symptoms, whereas the transcript shows she explicitly said 'No' to each specific question (P-5, P-7, P-8, P-10, P-24). It also incorrectly states that the patient did not answer the inquiry about neck stiffness, which is factually wrong as she answered 'No' in P-7.",
    "completeness": "The answer is complete in terms of covering the required symptoms and the specific list of denied symptoms requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly here. It hallucinates that the patient 'immediately began reporting her own history without answering' the neck stiffness inquiry [D-7], which is false (she said 'No'). It also attributes the lack of symptoms to omission in her opening statements [P-1] rather than acknowledging the explicit denials made later in the transcript, which the prompt specifically asked for.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to address the two-part question directly, though the underlying evidence provided is flawed. It stays focused on the symptoms and denials requested without unnecessary tangents regarding other medical history (though the Gold Answer provided more context, the Generated Answer stuck to the prompt's specific list)."
