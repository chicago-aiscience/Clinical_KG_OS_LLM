  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies all the key components mentioned in the Gold Answer. The diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test details, and isolation instructions are perfectly aligned with the transcript and the Gold Answer without any factual errors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most of the management plan but misses two secondary details present in the Gold Answer: 1) the expectation that symptoms take 'a few weeks' to resolve, and 2) the mention that the patient would receive 'further instructions from public health' once the results are back. However, it captures all primary clinical actions (diagnosis, hydration, meds, swab, and isolation).",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript segment [D-39]. There are no hallucinations or external clinical assumptions added.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part prompt, organizing the response logically into categories that mirror the question's requirements."
