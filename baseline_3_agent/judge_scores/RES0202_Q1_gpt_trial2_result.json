  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several mother-reported symptoms: dry cough, fever >100°F, fatigue/tiredness, decreased appetite, and possible loss of taste. It also reasonably reflects the mother’s uncertainty about shortness of breath (though it slightly overstates it as “reported” rather than “uncertain”). However, it contains a factual/quotation error about appetite (it implies he “had a ‘big appetite right now’,” whereas the transcript says he *doesn’t* have a big appetite). It also fails to identify several explicitly denied symptoms that are in the Gold Answer (e.g., wheeze, sore throat, chills, nausea/vomiting, etc.), which is primarily a completeness issue but also results in an overall less accurate picture of what was denied. Including “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript (minor inaccuracy).",
    "completeness": "Reported symptoms: captures cough, fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, possible taste loss; misses mild runny nose and does not clearly present the ‘shortness of breath uncertain’ nuance as in the Gold Answer. \nDenied/asked-about symptoms: includes chest pain and bowel changes/blood in stool, but omits many key explicit negatives from the Gold Answer: no sputum/blood, no wheezing, no sore throat, no chills/night sweats, no rash/skin changes, no nausea/vomiting, no urinary changes, no dizziness/fainting, no confusion/memory loss, and vision/hearing fine; also omits that swallowing difficulty was uncertain. Overall coverage is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s key negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references, but there are multiple ungrounded or inaccurate elements: (1) reference to a “knowledge graph” and a causal claim about tiredness causing shortness of breath are not in the transcript; (2) the appetite statement is misquoted/misrepresented; (3) family history is included under “symptoms denied,” which is not what was asked (though the family-history denial itself is transcript-supported).",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on respiratory/systemic symptoms and denied symptoms. However, it adds an irrelevant item (family history) that is not part of the question’s requested symptom review, and it fails to address several specifically requested denied items (e.g., wheezing, sore throat, chills, GI nausea/vomiting), which reduces how well it satisfies the question even though it remains generally on-topic."
