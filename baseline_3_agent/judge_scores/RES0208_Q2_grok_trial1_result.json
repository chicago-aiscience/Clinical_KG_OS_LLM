  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately lists Avodart for prostate enlargement (matches Gold's enlarged prostate/BPH from P-25/P-26) and Tums for reflux (P-27). The change (stopped previous reflux med because figured out foods, P-27) matches exactly. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points: Avodart and condition, Tums and condition, specific change to reflux regimen and reason. Misses minor Gold details like '(dutasteride)', explicit 'benign prostatic hyperplasia', doctor's 'Great' response, and allergies denial, but these are not core to the question (meds, conditions, change/why). Covers 100% of required key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All patient-specific claims (meds, conditions, change) directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-26, P-27). References to 'knowledge graph' for drug indications are not in transcript but plausible external knowledge; patient context grounds the links (Avodart after prostate mention, Tums for reflux). No fabricated patient facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly and fully addresses the question with structured sections on current meds/conditions and reflux change/reason; no off-topic content."
