  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely factually accurate compared to the Gold Answer. Key matches include sending tick for species ID (with minor citation shift, D-5 describes deer tick but plan in D-6/D-18), blood work for serology/titres, quick physical exam, prophylactic antibiotics due to >72h attachment, physician consultation after exam, and preventive advice on garden inspection (long grass, woods/fields) and insecticide. Minor discrepancies: physical exam described more generally ('assess condition and confirm risk') vs Gold's 'bite site'; antibiotics citation includes D-5 (incorrect, as >72h in D-6); omits geographic risk (Strathroy) and exact quotes; consultation as 'colleague or specialist' infers but transcript says 'the doctor/physician'; no hallucinated facts but slight rephrasing.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: tick to lab (species ID), blood work (titres/serology), physical exam, prophylactic antibiotics (>72h, safer to treat), physician consultation (talk to doctor), preventive advice (long grass/woods-fields, insecticide for garden). Partially covered: tick specimen details (plastic container missed), physical exam specificity (bite site missed), antibiotics rationale (geographic risk missed), quotes ('moving forward', 'safer than not'), waving legs motion, trainee-supervised inference. Covers ~85-90% of points across all categories (all main elements present, some details omitted).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript: tick lab [D-6,D-18], blood [D-18], physical exam [D-18], antibiotics [D-6,D-13,D-18], consultation [D-18,D-22], preventive details [D-18]. Citations mostly accurate (D-5 slightly off for tick plan/deer tick desc, D-5 for antibiotics incorrect but claim valid elsewhere). No fabrication; minor interpretive additions like 'confirm risk' plausible from context. Grounded with accurate citations overall.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the comprehensive plan into exact categories (diagnostic tests lab/physical, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice) with no off-topic content or tangents."
