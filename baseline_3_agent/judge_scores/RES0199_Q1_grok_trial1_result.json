  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer has significant factual discrepancies compared to Gold Answer: incorrectly states no specific frequency for diarrhea despite P-28 explicitly noting 'five or six times a day'; misses cough is dry (P-12), no sputum/blood (P-13); omits diarrhea as 2 days ago with liquid stools, no blood (P-28, P-29); misses vomiting details (yesterday, food contents, no blood P-32-34); for headache, fails to report 7/10 severity (P-8), locations (P-5), persistence details, and other characteristics; misattributes P-11 to cough 'nature' instead of stability; omits many negatives and additional symptoms like loss of smell and fatigue.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered partially: vomiting 2 episodes (yes), cough onset and stability (partial), diarrhea mention (vague), nausea (yes), headache onset and persistence (partial). Missed: cough dry/no sputum/blood/stable details, resp negatives (SOB/wheezing/chest pain), diarrhea precise 2 days/liquid/5-6x/day/no blood, vomiting yesterday/food/no blood, GI negatives, headache 7/10/bilateral forehead/top/no radiation/no stiffness/unusual, loss of smell, fatigue. Covers roughly 20-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: diarrhea/vomiting/nausea/cough/headache onsets from P-1/P-32 ok; vomiting 2x (P-32) accurate; nausea today (P-32). Issues: falsely claims no diarrhea frequency (contradicts P-28); mislabels P-11 as cough 'nature' (it's stability, nature dry in P-12); headache severity inferred from persistence/Tylenol/'sick' rather than direct 7/10 (P-8), plausible but not precise. No outright fabrications, but inaccurate statements and citations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around GI (diarrhea/vomiting/nausea), respiratory (cough), and headache characteristics/severity as questioned; no off-topic content or tangents, perfectly focused despite incompleteness."
