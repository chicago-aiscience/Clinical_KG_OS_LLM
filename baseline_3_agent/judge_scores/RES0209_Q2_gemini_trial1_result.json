  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the medication as a bronchodilator. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the administration method, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions it is a 'puffer' (D-7, P-7). Furthermore, it incorrectly claims the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication, while the doctor explicitly asked if there was a medication taken 'every day no matter what' (D-5).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses all three parts of the prompt (medication, administration, and controller medication), but it fails to provide the correct information for two of those parts by claiming the information is missing from the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It claims information is not present when it is clearly stated in the text (D-5 for the controller medication and D-7/P-7 for the puffer). This is a significant failure of grounding.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to answer the specific questions posed by the user without irrelevant tangents."
