  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Claritin and allergy shots, but fails to provide the specific name for the birth control ('Deyo') mentioned in P-26. Furthermore, it incorrectly states that no dosing or frequency details were mentioned, whereas the transcript explicitly states the birth control 'goes for three months' [P-27] and allergy shots were 'once a week' [P-20].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: the specific name of the birth control ('Deyo'), the frequency of allergy shots (weekly), the dosing/cycle of the birth control (3 months), the denial of an EpiPen, and the denial of medication allergies.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer includes a hallucinated citation '[KG]' which does not appear in the provided transcript. It also contains a negative hallucination by claiming no dosing/frequency details were available when they were clearly stated in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured appropriately and addresses the categories requested in the question, but it fails to fulfill the specific instruction to include 'specific names' and 'dosing details' because it overlooks that information in the text."
