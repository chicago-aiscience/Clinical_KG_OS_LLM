  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies core reported symptoms like dry cough (with partial details on onset and worsening), fever over 100°F, fatigue, possible loss of taste, and addresses SOB (though overstates as clearly reported when mother was uncertain). However, it has significant errors: misquotes P-15 as 'had a \"big appetite right now\"' implying normal appetite, whereas transcript says 'doesn't seem to have a big appetite' (decreased); misses runny nose entirely; understates cough progression over 3 days and fever first on Friday; incomplete/inaccurate denied symptoms list (only covers chest pain, GI, and irrelevant family history, misses sputum/blood, wheezing, sore throat, chills, etc.). These are significant discrepancies/omissions vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers key reported points partially: cough (~70%), fever, fatigue, decreased appetite (listed but misdescribed), loss of taste, SOB (partial); misses runny nose completely. Denied symptoms: covers chest pain and GI complaints (~20% of Gold's list, ignores sputum, wheezing, sore throat, chills, etc.). Overall ~40-50% coverage of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded with accurate citations (e.g., cough P-1/P-5, fever P-1, fatigue P-1/P-8, taste P-17). Hallucinations/misreads: appetite misquote (P-15 reversed meaning); references non-existent 'knowledge graph' and infers 'tiredness can cause SOB' from it; overinterprets SOB as 'reported' vs mother's uncertainty; lists family history as denied 'symptom'. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response into reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and denied symptoms, matching question; minor off-topic (KG reference, family history). Perfectly focused overall."
