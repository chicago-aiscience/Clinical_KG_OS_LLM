  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes mother's explicit concern about COVID from school [P-2], precise sick contacts (none known outside 'for sure' [P-38], uncertain at school 'kinda hard to say' [P-38]), school no notification [P-39], school test requirement [P-41], no travel/env exposures. Generated correctly notes timeline post-school suggesting school source [P-1], but inaccurately claims no specific sick contacts at school OR outside without nuance (misses distinction), wrong citation [P-1 instead of P-38/39], omits mother's COVID-school worry, adds unmentioned 'knowledge graph' for cough/asthma. Significant errors in sick contact details and extras contradict Gold's precision. Score: 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: school central/mother COVID concern [P-2], symptoms post-school [P-1], no sick outside but uncertain school [P-38], no school contact [P-39], school test req [P-41], no travel [P-40], no env [P-37]. Generated covers timeline/school source (~20%), no sick contacts broadly (~10%), no school notif (~10%). Misses ~70%: nuance on contacts, COVID concern, test req, no travel/env. Covers 20-49%. Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Timeline [P-1] and COVID symptoms [D-44] verifiable. Sick contacts/no notification claimed from [P-1] unverifiable (actual [P-38/39]). 'Knowledge graph' for cough/viral/asthma hallucinated (doctor mentions asthma possibility [D-45] but not as source suspicion). Multiple hallucinations/mis-cites. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Generated uses sections directly matching question (source via school, sick contacts, school notification). No off-topic content. Perfectly focused. Score: 5."
