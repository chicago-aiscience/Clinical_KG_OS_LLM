  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer on all core facts: COVID-19 as the condition identified by both (with matching citations [P-1], [D-39]), swab test ordered ([D-39]), 48-hour turnaround ([D-39]), and isolation instructions ([D-39]). Minor omissions like 'today' for the test and 'further instructions from public health' do not introduce errors, keeping core facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 identified by both with citations - covered; (2) COVID swab test 'today' - swab covered but 'today' and explicit 'COVID' test missed; (3) 48 hours - covered; (4) stay isolated in home/not see others - covered; (5) further instructions from public health - missed. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: patient concern [P-1], doctor's COVID mention and swab/48 hours/isolation [D-39]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer uses bullet points to directly and concisely address each element of the question (condition, test, turnaround, instructions) without any off-topic content."
