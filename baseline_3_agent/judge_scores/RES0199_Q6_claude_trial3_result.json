  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and the source transcript. All key facts match - COVID-19 swab ordered with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and all supportive care measures. The only minor discrepancy is the transcription of 'NSAIDs' as 'anseads', which appears to be a transcription artifact rather than a factual error by the evaluator.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) diagnostic test ordered (COVID-19 swab), (2) timing of results (24-48 hours), (3) isolation duration (14 days), (4) contact tracing conditions (if positive), (5) all supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutrition, rest, antipyretics, NSAIDs/Tylenol for pain). The Generated Answer does not mention the alternative diagnosis consideration ('another viral illness') which was included in the Gold Answer, representing a minor omission.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript [D-52]. The answer properly cites the source and does not include any hallucinated information. The structure and content are grounded in what the doctor actually said. The transcription of 'anseads' instead of 'NSAIDs' reflects what was in the transcript, not a fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about the doctor's complete management plan. It systematically covers all requested elements: diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care recommendations. The organization is clear and focused, with no irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent, comprehensive response to the question with high accuracy and faithfulness to the source material. It correctly identifies all major components of the management plan including the COVID-19 swab, 14-day isolation, conditional contact tracing, and all supportive care recommendations. The only notable omission is the mention of an alternative viral illness diagnosis if COVID-19 is negative, which represents a minor gap in completeness. All information is properly grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations."
