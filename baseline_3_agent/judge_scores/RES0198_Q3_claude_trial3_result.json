  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the viral diagnosis and includes accurate symptom details (stuffy/runny nose, clear discharge, one-week duration, symptom progression). However, it misses several key differentiating features that the Gold Answer explicitly mentions: absence of fever, cough, sore throat, headache, and colored discharge - all critical for ruling out bacterial causes. It also omits the discussion of absent allergic triggers (no exposure to fumes/dust/animals, no known allergies, no prior episodes) that rule out allergic etiology. The Generated Answer references a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of the Gold Answer's key points. It includes: symptom type (nasal congestion/rhinorrhea), discharge quality (clear), duration (one week), symptom progression (stuffy to runny), and the viral diagnosis conclusion. However, it completely omits: (1) absent features ruling out bacterial infection (no fever, cough, sore throat, headache, shortness of breath, chills, post-nasal drip), (2) evidence against allergic etiology (no environmental exposures, no allergies, no prior similar episodes), (3) the daycare exposure context, and (4) explicit mention that clear (not colored) discharge argues against bacterial infection.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination by repeatedly referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not exist in the source transcript (e.g., 'According to the Knowledge Graph, both of these symptoms indicate viral illness'). All other claims appear verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The symptom descriptions, timeline, and doctor's conclusion are faithfully represented. However, the fabricated Knowledge Graph reference is a notable departure from the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by explaining evidence for viral infection. However, it only partially fulfills the question's scope, which specifically asks for evidence distinguishing viral from 'allergic or bacterial' causes. The answer focuses primarily on positive viral indicators but largely ignores the differential diagnosis aspect - it doesn't explain why allergic or bacterial causes were ruled out, which is half of what the question requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the viral diagnosis and includes accurate symptom details but provides incomplete coverage of the differential diagnosis. It covers basic viral indicators (symptoms, timeline, progression) but omits critical absent features that rule out bacterial infection (no fever, cough, colored discharge) and allergic causes (no exposures, allergies, or prior episodes). A significant faithfulness issue is the repeated reference to a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph.' The answer addresses the question but misses the key comparative analysis requested - explaining why bacterial and allergic etiologies were excluded alongside why viral was supported."
