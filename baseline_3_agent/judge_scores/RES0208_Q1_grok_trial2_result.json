  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer includes most key symptoms from the Gold Answer (e.g., loss of taste, muscle aches/weakness, fever, loss of appetite, sore throat, cough) but has significant factual errors: incorrectly attributes sore throat and cough to [P-1] (which only mentions shortness of breath, fatigue, and being rundown, not those symptoms), misquotes patient as explicitly stating 'sore throat and cough' together (they are reported separately later in [P-7]-[P-9]), omits qualifiers like symptoms being mild/starting/dry/early, and relies on doctor's summary [D-36] rather than patient reports for some; misses smell loss, runny nose denial, and headaches entirely; core symptoms are present but with contradictions in details and citations compared to Gold's precise reporting.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: sensory (taste loss, smell loss - new); upper resp (early dry cough, mild sore throat starting, denied runny nose/congestion); musculoskeletal (generalized achy muscle aches, weakness); constitutional (subjective fever, decreased appetite, mild usual headaches). Generated covers: taste loss, sore throat, cough, weakness, achy, fever, appetite loss (~7/11 points, 60-65%, missing smell loss, runny nose denial, headaches, and qualifiers/details).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: weakness [P-2], achy [P-20], taste [P-4], hot/warm [P-4], appetite [P-2,P-4]; however, sore throat and cough falsely attributed to [P-1] (not present there, patient reports them later in [P-7]-[P-9] without the exact phrasing 'sore throat and cough'); doctor's summary [D-36] cited for muscle aches but patient confirms [P-20]; inaccurate citations and fabricated direct quote/phrasing indicate hallucination in attribution.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing symptoms beyond SOB/fatigue, categorized exactly as specified (sensory changes, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional), with transcript citations, no off-topic content."
