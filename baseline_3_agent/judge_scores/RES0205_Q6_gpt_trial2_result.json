  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s plan described at the end of the consult (D-37): (1) a quick physical exam with auscultation (“quick listen to your heart and lungs”) and (2) then consulting the doctor they are working with, reviewing what was discussed, and returning to discuss next steps (“where to go from here”). No statements contradict the Gold Answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: specified exam components (heart/lung auscultation + quick physical exam) and the described process (consult supervising doctor, review discussion, return to discuss next steps). Missing/minimally addressed elements from the Gold Answer: the earlier foreshadowing at D-1, explicit note that no diagnosis/medication was provided yet, and that the transcript ends before findings/treatment. These are contextual but still part of the Gold Answer’s stated plan/interpretation.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by D-37; no additional clinical conclusions or ungrounded details are introduced. No hallucinations detected.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what was asked: the doctor’s end-of-consult plan, the specified physical exam components, and the process for determining next steps. No irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "The answer is accurate, well-grounded, and directly responsive, but slightly less complete than the Gold Answer due to omitted contextual points (D-1 foreshadowing and the explicit note that no diagnosis/treatment was given yet)."
