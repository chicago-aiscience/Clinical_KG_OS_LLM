  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies: (1) teenage anxiety attacks discussed with a family doctor and no recent care for ~8 years [P-21]; (2) current attempt to quit smoking with reduction to ~5 cigarettes/day [P-14]; (3) academic stress from nearing completion of a Masters thesis with a recent time-crunch worsening stress in the last couple of weeks [P-15, P-16]; and (4) chest pain starting ~1.5 weeks ago, sharp with deep breaths, lasting ~20 minutes, not relieved by OTC meds [P-2, P-3, P-6].\nHowever, it introduces unsupported/overstated causal language (e.g., “stress manifested as chest pain,” “triggered a somatic response”) when the patient only speculates it “could be stress” [P-8]. It also attributes “shortness of breath and heart flutter” broadly to baseline anxiety and to a “knowledge graph”; the transcript only notes heart flutter during prior anxiety attacks [P-20] and faster breathing when she makes herself nervous now [P-19], without tying these specifically to teen anxiety. These issues reduce factual accuracy versus the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: teenage anxiety with doctor visit [P-21]; current high academic stress/time crunch [P-15, P-16]; chest pain onset ~1.5 weeks ago and new symptom [P-2, P-17]; smoking reduction/trying to quit [P-14].\nKey elements missed from the Gold Answer: smoking start around age 18 and pattern of escalation to ~10 cigarettes/day for the last two years before cutting down a few months ago [P-18]; explicit mention that anxiety symptoms largely resolved for ~8 years [P-22]; father’s heart attack last year (in his 50s) as a driver of cardiac fear [P-8, P-30]; the symptom pattern that pain is noticed more when alone and less when distracted/talking/with others [P-9, P-29]. Because several major timeline links and relational transitions are absent, coverage is only partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated references to a “knowledge graph,” and the claim that the knowledge graph notes shortness of breath/heart flutter as anxiety baseline and that smoking is classified as a risk factor. Additionally, linking faster breathing in [P-19] specifically to “thesis work” is an inference; the patient attributes it to becoming nervous about the chest pain itself. Some inferences are plausible but not explicitly supported, leading to moderate unfaithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the requested timeline and attempts to explain how phases relate (anxiety history → current stress → chest symptoms; smoking as contextual factor). Minor distractions (knowledge graph discussion) do not dominate, but the answer fails to directly address the smoking start timing requested in the question."
