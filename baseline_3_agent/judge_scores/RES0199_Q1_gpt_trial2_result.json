  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple factual issues relative to the Gold Answer/transcript. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify diarrhea frequency, despite the patient clearly reporting “five or six times a day” [P-28]. It also fails to report the headache severity rating (7/10 [P-8]) and instead substitutes a subjective inference of “high severity,” which is not what was asked. For the cough, it omits the key characteristic that it was “mostly a dry cough” [P-12] and that there was no sputum or blood [P-13]. Vomiting count (two times) is correct [P-32], but the answer omits important specified characteristics (timing yesterday, food contents, no blood). Overall, the core elements requested (nature of cough, diarrhea frequency, vomiting episodes, headache severity rating) are not accurately and fully provided.",
    "completeness": "Key requested items covered vs missed:\n- Nature of cough: MISSED (should state mostly dry, no sputum/blood; stable severity).\n- Diarrhea frequency: MISSED (should state liquid stools 5–6 times/day).\n- Number of vomiting episodes: PARTIALLY covered (states two times, but misses timing and contents/no blood).\n- Headache severity rating: MISSED (should state 7/10).\nAdditionally, several pertinent negatives included in the Gold Answer (no SOB/wheezing/chest pain; no blood in stool; etc.) are omitted. Coverage is well under 50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded or are misleading. The claim that diarrhea frequency is not explicitly stated contradicts [P-28]. The answer also infers “high severity level” for the headache rather than using the explicit 7/10 rating, which is an unsupported interpretation. Most other statements (vomited two times; cough started four days ago; nausea today) are grounded, but the major miss/contradiction regarding diarrhea frequency and the inferred severity reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on GI symptoms, respiratory symptoms, and headache characteristics, which are relevant to the question. However, it does not supply the specific characteristics the question explicitly requests (dry vs productive cough; diarrhea frequency; headache rating), limiting its practical relevance despite being on-topic."
