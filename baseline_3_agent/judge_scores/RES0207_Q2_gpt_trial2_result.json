  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The medication identified (Keppra for epilepsy) is correct and matches the Gold Answer and transcript (P-23, P-8). However, for the second part, the Generated Answer states only that the patient “forgot” the dose (P-9). While true, it does not provide the *specific circumstance* asked for and emphasized in the Gold Answer (daughter’s birthday celebration and altered dinner routine), so the response is only partially correct for that component.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points: (1) Keppra for chronic epilepsy; (2) missed dose occurred because of daughter’s birthday celebration leading to a changed routine/earlier celebration and no usual dinner-time cue, resulting in forgetting. The Generated Answer includes (1) and a generic version of (2) (“forgot”), but omits the specific circumstance (birthday/changed routine/dinner timing) and related context. Roughly half of the key information is covered.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript: Keppra (P-23) and forgetting a dose (P-9). No additional unsupported details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on the two items asked (current medication and why a dose was missed). However, it fails to provide the requested specificity about the circumstance behind the missed dose, reducing how well it addresses the question."
