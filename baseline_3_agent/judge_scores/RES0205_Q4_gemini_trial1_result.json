{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19), the test (COVID test), the result (negative), and the primary workplace concerns (working at a hospital and colleagues' fear).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the major components of the question but misses some specific details provided in the gold answer. Specifically, it describes the timing of the test as 'during this 2-week duration' rather than the more precise 'at the onset of symptoms' mentioned in [P-36]. It also omits details regarding the patient's specific role as a 'clerk', the mention of PPE usage, and the fact that the patient is currently staying home waiting for symptoms to resolve before returning.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript. The citations [P-2, P-35, P-17] are appropriate, although the timing explanation relies on inference from [P-35] and [P-2] rather than the direct statement in [P-36].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the multi-part question without including extraneous information."
