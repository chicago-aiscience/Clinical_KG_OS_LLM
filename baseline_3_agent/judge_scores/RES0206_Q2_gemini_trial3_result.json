  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not provide information for three out of the four parts of the question. Specifically, it states that the frequency of inhaler use is not specified, despite P-26 clearly stating one is used 'every day' and the other 'once every two weeks'. It also claims there is no info on hypertension management or the reason for no medication, even though P-23 and P-24 explicitly mention lifestyle changes, weight loss, and walking as the chosen strategy and reason.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific inhaler frequencies, the lifestyle management strategies (weight loss/walking), and the specific reason for avoiding medication (patient choice to try lifestyle first).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains 'false negative' hallucinations, asserting that information is missing from the source text when that information is clearly present in multiple turns of the transcript (P-23, P-24, P-26).",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in terms of its structure and focus; it attempts to address each part of the user's prompt, but it fails to extract the correct data."
