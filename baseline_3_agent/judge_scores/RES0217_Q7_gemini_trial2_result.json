{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the timeline (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening), the doctor's 72-hour estimate, and the comparison of symptoms/engorgement between the current and prior (10 years ago) episodes.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer, including the specific activities, the 72-hour attachment estimate, the prior bullseye rash, and the difference in tick engorgement. It misses the specific geographic location (Strathroy) mentioned in the Gold Answer and the explicit 'earlier today' discovery time, but addresses both parts of the prompt comprehensively.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript. However, it includes an artifact '[KG]' which is not present in the source text or the Gold Answer, suggesting a minor hallucination of a citation or tag. All clinical details provided are supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, structured specifically to answer the two parts of the multi-part question: the timeline of exposure and the comparison to the prior experience."
