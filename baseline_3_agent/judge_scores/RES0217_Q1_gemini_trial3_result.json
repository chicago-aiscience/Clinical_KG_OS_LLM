  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the systemic symptoms. It claims the doctor did not screen for fever, joint pain, or headaches, which directly contradicts the transcript: [D-7] screens for joint pain, [D-8] screens for fever, and [D-19] screens for headaches. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these interactions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses approximately 50% of the required information. While it provides a good level of detail for the local symptoms, it fails to provide any of the systemic symptoms requested in the prompt (fever, joint pain, headaches) because it incorrectly asserts they were not in the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a failure in faithfulness by 'hallucinating' the absence of information. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain evidence of screening for fever, joint pain, or headaches, when these are clearly present in the provided source text.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant in its attempt to answer the prompt, but the second half of the response is dedicated to explaining why it cannot answer the question based on a false premise (that the data is missing), which reduces its utility and relevance to the user's inquiry."
