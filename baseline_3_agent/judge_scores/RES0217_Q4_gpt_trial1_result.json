  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the clinician assessed for erythema migrans (bullseye rash) and that it was not present, consistent with the transcript (patient denies the larger circle rash). It also correctly lists the proposed evaluations: physical exam, sending the tick for species ID, and blood work/serology. Minor issues: it relies on “implied absent” rather than explicitly stating the patient’s denial, and it cites [D-6] for blood work even though blood work/serology is proposed at [D-18]. It does not introduce major incorrect facts beyond slight overstatement that tests would “definitively exclude” Lyme disease.",
    "completeness": "Key absent clinical features in the Gold Answer include: no erythema migrans, no joint pain, no fever/illness, no headaches, and generally feeling well; also noted were no other bites/exposures. The generated answer only includes the bullseye rash and omits joint pain, fever/systemic symptoms, headaches, and the “feeling well” confirmation (and no other bites). For diagnostic tests, it covers the three main proposed evaluations (physical exam, tick ID, serology) but omits the plan to consult a supervising physician. Overall, it captures less than half of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript (rash screening; tick sent to lab; blood work/serology; physical exam). The main faithfulness concerns are minor: one inaccurate citation (blood work linked to [D-6]) and slight overstatement about “definitively exclude” Lyme disease. No major hallucinated clinical findings are added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic and addresses both parts of the question (absent clinical features and proposed diagnostic tests), with no irrelevant tangents. However, it under-addresses the first part by listing only one absent feature."

  "summary": "The answer is largely accurate and transcript-grounded for the rash and proposed tests, but it is notably incomplete because it omits several other screened-and-denied Lyme features (joint pain, fever/illness, headaches, overall well-being) and the planned physician consultation."
