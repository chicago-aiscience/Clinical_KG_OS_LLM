  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition and the COVID swab as the test. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain details regarding social contacts. The transcript explicitly mentions the patient walking dogs with a friend who was 'a bit sick' (P-20), which is the primary reason the doctor considers the diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers two out of the three specific points requested. It fails to provide the detail about social contacts (the sick friend and walking too close), which is a key part of the question and the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a negative hallucination, claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is present in segment [P-20]. The other two points are accurately grounded in [D-43].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, addressing all three parts of the prompt directly, even though one part is answered incorrectly."
