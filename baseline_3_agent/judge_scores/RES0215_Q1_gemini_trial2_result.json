  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies the 'earliest symptoms.' It states that all reported symptoms (wheezing, cough, and shortness of breath) were present since the issue started. However, the Gold Answer and the transcript [P-1, P-2] clarify that wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths were the first symptoms, while the cough appeared more recently ('and now she has a slight cough').",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer lists the primary symptoms but misses several details included in the Gold Answer, such as the cough being non-productive (no phlegm), the absence of cyanosis (not turning blue), and the fact that the child looks fine otherwise.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misinterprets the transcript's timeline. It ignores the mother's use of the word 'now' regarding the cough in [P-1] and the specific answer in [P-2] where she only identifies wheezing and difficulty breathing as the first things noticed, instead claiming all symptoms started 4-5 days ago.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant as it directly addresses both parts of the question, although the information provided for the second part is inaccurate."
