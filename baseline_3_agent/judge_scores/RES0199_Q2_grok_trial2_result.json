  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol for headache with accurate citations [P-3, P-4], matching Gold. Doctor's recommendations for hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol/NSAIDs for symptoms, COVID test, and isolation are consistent. Minor discrepancy: interprets 'anseads' as analgesics (Gold specifies NSAIDs); hallucinates 'knowledge graph' link, but core facts align without errors impacting main points.",
    "completeness": "Covers: Tylenol for headache; doctor's supportive measures (hydration, food, sleep); Tylenol for fever; Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches; COVID swab/isolation. Misses: patient's self-hydration efforts [P-30]; explicit note of no prescription medications. Covers ~85-90% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable in transcript with citations (e.g., [P-3], [P-4], [D-52]). 'Anseads' matches transcript phrasing (likely NSAID transcription error). Hallucinates 'knowledge graph' linkage, which is not in transcript; otherwise grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around patient's home medication/symptom and doctor's recommendations, perfectly matching question focus with no off-topic content."
