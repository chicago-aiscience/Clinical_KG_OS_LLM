  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnostic test (COVID swab) and the primary rationale (infectious presentation and household transmission) as described in the Gold Answer. It accurately quotes the doctor's statements from the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a specific nuance mentioned in the Gold Answer: that influenza was only brought up as a possibility after the COVID-19 plan was established and after the doctor confirmed the patient had not received a flu shot.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes references to a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source transcript. However, the actual clinical information and the specific quotes from the transcript [D-53, P-1] are accurate and grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and specifically addresses both parts of the question regarding the test ordered and the rationale for prioritization."
