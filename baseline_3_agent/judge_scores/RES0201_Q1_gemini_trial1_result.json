  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims that the transcript lacks explicit denials for cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, and chest pain. However, the transcript explicitly shows the patient denying these: cough [P-15], runny nose [P-16], headaches [P-17], chest pain [P-18], and fever [P-23]. Additionally, it fails to mention difficulty breathing, which is a major symptom reported by the patient.",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete. It misses two major symptoms reported by the patient: difficulty breathing [P-7, P-8] and fatigue/muscle aches [P-25]. It also fails to list the majority of the 'pertinent negatives' (symptoms denied) that were requested by the prompt and present in the Gold Answer, such as chills, night sweats, sick contacts, and travel.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is not in the transcript when it clearly is. By stating there are 'no explicit statements' regarding the denial of cough, runny nose, etc., it contradicts the source text directly.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address both parts of the question (reported symptoms and denied symptoms), but due to its factual errors, it fails to provide the relevant information requested."
