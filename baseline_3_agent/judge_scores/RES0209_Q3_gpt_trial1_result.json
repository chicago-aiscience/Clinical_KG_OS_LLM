  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key asthma-worsening pattern: dry cough, shortness of breath, wheeze, chest tightness, and markedly increased bronchodilator use with symptomatic relief. However, it contains notable factual/citation errors: it claims chest tightness was affirmed but cites [P-4] and [P-9], which do not relate to chest tightness (the relevant confirmation is [P-20]); it attributes the bronchodilator frequency increase to [P-9] (actual is [P-8]). It also refers to a “knowledge graph provided,” which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer and is therefore unsupported.",
    "completeness": "Covers many Gold Answer key points: classic asthma symptom cluster (dry cough, SOB, wheeze, chest tightness), increased rescue inhaler use, and presence of typical triggers (exercise/cold). It partially covers bronchodilator benefit. It misses several important Gold Answer elements supporting “not a new respiratory condition,” especially the negative infectious screen (no URI, sick contacts, fever, loss of taste/smell, travel, GI symptoms) and lack of productive cough, and it does not mention wheezing occurring even more frequently than bronchodilator use (D-17/P-17).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded as presented: the “knowledge graph” section is fabricated relative to the provided transcript; multiple citations are incorrect/misattributed (e.g., chest tightness affirmation tied to [P-4]/[P-9]; bronchodilator frequency tied to [P-9] instead of [P-8]). While the overall clinical narrative is plausible and largely consistent with the transcript, these issues represent multiple ungrounded or mis-grounded claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked combination of symptoms and increased bronchodilator use indicating worsening asthma. The “knowledge graph” digression is not responsive to the question and adds minor irrelevant content, but most of the answer remains on-topic."
