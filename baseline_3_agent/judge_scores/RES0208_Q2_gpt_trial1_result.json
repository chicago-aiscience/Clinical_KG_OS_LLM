  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two current medications (Avodart and Tums), matches each to the condition stated in the transcript (prostate enlargement/urinary issues and reflux), and correctly describes that he stopped his prior reflux medication because he identified dietary triggers/foods that help. No statements contradict the Gold Answer. Minor specificity is missing (e.g., ‘benign prostatic hyperplasia’/not cancer; Tums being PRN/OTC), but what is stated is accurate.",
    "completeness": "For the question asked (current meds + indication for each + what change he made to his prior reflux med and why), the Generated Answer includes all major required elements: Avodart → enlarged prostate; Tums → reflux; stopped prior reflux medication because he figured out helpful foods. It omits some supporting details present in the Gold Answer (e.g., BPH/not cancer clarification; Tums ‘here and there’/as-needed; naming dutasteride), but these are not strictly required to answer the question fully.",
    "faithfulness": "All key claims are directly supported by the transcript: Avodart use [P-26], Tums use for reflux and prior medication stopped due to diet changes [P-27]. The mention of a ‘knowledge graph’ is extraneous but does not introduce new clinical facts. No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the asked items (medications, their indications, and the self-directed change to reflux meds with rationale) without unrelated tangents."
