  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the two current medications (Avodart and Tums) and links them to the appropriate conditions (prostate enlargement/BPH and reflux). It also correctly states that the patient stopped his prior reflux medication and did so because he managed symptoms by identifying helpful foods. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Avodart for enlarged prostate, (2) Tums for reflux, (3) stopped prior reflux medication, (4) reason was dietary modification/figuring out trigger foods. Key Gold Answer points not included: that Tums is used only “here and there”/PRN, that the prostate issue was clarified as not cancer/BPH wording, the physician’s positive response (“Great, that’s great”), and the denial of allergies. Because several details present in the Gold Answer are omitted, completeness is slightly reduced.",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims (Avodart use, Tums use, discontinuation of prior reflux medication, dietary reason) are directly supported by the transcript citations [P-26], [P-27]. The mention of a “knowledge graph” is extraneous but does not introduce new clinical facts beyond the transcript. No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked items: current medications, what each is for, and the patient-initiated change to reflux medication and why. No meaningful tangents."
