  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the start of the cough on Wednesday night, the onset of fatigue on Thursday, and the appearance of the fever and appetite loss on Friday.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the gold answer: it omits the 'mild runny nose' mentioned in [P-16], the specific temperature range (100.1-101°F), and the context of the mother correcting the doctor's timeline from five days to three days [P-4]. It also fails to explicitly state that the cough worsened on Thursday (as noted in [P-1] and the gold answer), only mentioning the worsening on Friday.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript. The mention of potential breathing difficulties is correctly attributed to the parent's speculation in [P-8].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's requirements for a day-by-day evolution and specific symptom onset times."
