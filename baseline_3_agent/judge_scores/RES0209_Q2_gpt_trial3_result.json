  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold: only asthma med is an as-needed bronchodilator/rescue inhaler, administered via a “puffer” (inhaler), and clinician asked about a daily controller taken “every day no matter what,” which patient does not have. Generated answer correctly identifies the bronchodilator, but incorrectly states administration is not specified (it is: “puffer” in D-7/P-7) and incorrectly claims the doctor did not ask about daily controller medication (D-5/P-5 explicitly cover this). These are significant contradictions to the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: (1) only medication is bronchodilator/rescue inhaler; (2) used PRN/as-needed; (3) administered via puffer/inhaler; (4) no other meds; (5) clinician asked about daily controller/maintenance med taken daily and patient does not have it. Generated answer covers only (1) partially. It misses (2) as-needed use, (3) puffer route, (4) no other meds, and (5) the daily controller question/absence. Overall coverage is well under half of required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded and directly contradicted by the transcript: the transcript *does* specify “puffer” (D-7/P-7) and *does* include the clinician asking about a daily medication taken every day (D-5) with patient denial (P-5). The answer’s citations are also misapplied (e.g., using D-20 about chest tightness as evidence regarding controller-med inquiry). One element (patient uses bronchodilator) is grounded in P-1, but multiple key claims are unfaithful.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at the asked items (current asthma med, administration, missing daily controller), but provides incorrect denials and omits key details. It remains mostly on-topic with minimal tangential content."
