  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two proposed diagnostic procedures: chest X-ray and COVID swab, consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. It also correctly states the rationale for the COVID swab as a general/standard practice for anyone presenting with these symptoms. However, it adds an unsupported statement: “This decision is noted in the knowledge graph…,” which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer and slightly detracts from factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) chest X-ray proposed to get a better look; (2) COVID swab proposed; (3) explicit rationale that they are doing swabs for anyone with these symptoms lately. Not included (but not strictly required by the question): the explanatory description of X-ray as a picture inside the body, and comments about the swab being uncomfortable/reassurance, and arranging tests/return with doctor. Overall, the essential elements asked in the question are covered.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly grounded in transcript lines [D-37] and [D-39]. The “knowledge graph” mention is not supported by the transcript and constitutes a minor hallucinated/unverifiable detail, though it does not change the clinical meaning.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on what diagnostic procedures were proposed and the rationale for ordering the COVID swab, which directly addresses the question without major tangents."
