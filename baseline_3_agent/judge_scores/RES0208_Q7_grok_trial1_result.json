  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main timeline phases and most symptoms: onset SOB, fatigue, weakness, reduced appetite; yesterday fever; morning loss of taste; emerging cough and sore throat. Minor discrepancies include omitting body aches (placed in onset by Gold), loss of smell, headaches, and the specific 'laborious breathing' description; it correctly avoids contradictions but adds unsubstantiated references to a 'knowledge graph' and COVID alignment not central to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: onset SOB, fatigue/tired/rundown, weakness, reduced appetite; yesterday subjective fever; morning loss of taste; emerging cough (dry, starting), sore throat (starting). Missed: laborious breathing detail, generalized body aches (onset), diminished smell (morning), mild headaches (emerging, baseline similar), wife's forehead confirmation detail. Covers ~70-75% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable with accurate citations (P-1, P-2, P-4, P-7, P-9); doctor's summary in D-36 supports emerging symptoms. However, hallucinations include repeated references to a non-existent 'knowledge graph' and its relation to COVID-19 symptoms, which are not in the transcript; 'physical limitations' is a plausible paraphrase but adds slight interpretation.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response around the question's timeline (onset couple days ago, yesterday fever, morning taste loss, emerging at consult) with clear sections matching the query's examples; minor irrelevance from knowledge graph mentions."
