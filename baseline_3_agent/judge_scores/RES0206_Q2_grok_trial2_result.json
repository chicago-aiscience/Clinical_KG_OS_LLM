  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately extracts from transcript: COPD uses two inhalers (daily maintenance [P-26], rescue as needed ~once every 2 weeks [P-26], no home O2 [P-1]); HTN diagnosed but no meds, chose lifestyle first (weight loss, walking [P-23,P-24]), BP OK [P-23], doc supports [D-25], additional lifestyle (quit smoking [P-40], rare alcohol [P-39], well-managed baseline [P-28]). Generated Answer correctly notes use of puffers for COPD [P-1,P-26 implied] and HTN diagnosis [P-22] with no meds, but factually errs by claiming no frequency specified (directly contradicted by [P-26]), no management strategies (ignores lifestyle details [P-23,P-24]), and no reason for no antiHTN meds (explicit in [P-23]). Significant contradictions on key facts present in transcript/Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: COPD (2 inhalers, daily/rescue freq, no O2, no names); HTN (dx, no meds, lifestyle reason/wt loss/walking/BP OK/doc support); extras (quit smoke, rare alc, well-managed, no allergies). Generated covers: COPD puffers (partial, misses types/freq/no O2); HTN dx/no meds (partial). Misses: inhaler frequencies, specific lifestyle strategies/reason for no meds, quit smoking, etc. Covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated verifiable claims: puffers manageable [P-1], HTN history [P-22]. But hallucinates absences: 'does not specify exact frequency' (falsely, [P-26] has 'every day' and 'once every two weeks'); 'no information on... management strategies' or 'reason' for no antiHTN (falsely, [P-23,P-24] detail lifestyle choice). Multiple inaccurate claims about transcript content, not grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated uses bullets directly mirroring question parts (COPD meds/usage, HTN meds/management, reason no antiHTN), no off-topic content, fully focused on query despite inaccuracies."
