  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant error in the chronological sequence. It states the fever came before the sore throat, but the transcript clearly shows the sore throat developed 'just before' the fever [P-1]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies stuffy nose → sore throat → fever as the progression. The Generated Answer incorrectly lists: stuffy nose → fever → sore throat. Additionally, the timing comparison with the husband is imprecise - the Gold Answer calculates ~4 days difference, while Generated Answer vaguely states 'slightly more recently.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: (1) The temporal relationship confirming stuffy nose came first via D-2/P-2/D-3/P-3 exchange, (2) The specific confirmation that muscle aches appeared concurrently with fever (D-15/P-15/P-16), (3) The calculation that husband's symptoms started ~4 days before patient's fever, (4) The staggered onset pattern indicating household transmission mentioned in D-51/D-53. It covers approximately 50% of the key details.",
    "faithfulness": "The core symptoms mentioned are grounded in the transcript, but the sequence error (fever before sore throat) misrepresents what the patient actually said. The patient states 'just before that [fever] I had a stuffy nose...and I had a sore throat' [P-1], indicating sore throat preceded or coincided with fever onset, not followed it. The citation references are accurate but the interpretation contains an error.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about chronological progression and comparison to husband's timeline. It stays focused on the relevant symptom timeline without tangential information. However, the incorrect sequence undermines its utility despite being topically relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's core components but contains a critical factual error in symptom sequencing, placing fever before sore throat when the transcript indicates otherwise. It misses important temporal confirmations and the calculated 4-day difference in onset between spouses. While grounded in the transcript and topically relevant, the sequence error and incomplete coverage of key points significantly impact its quality compared to the Gold Answer."
