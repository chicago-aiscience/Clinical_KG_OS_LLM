  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three medications (Salbutamol, Ramipril, Tylenol) and their indications. However, it makes a major factual error by claiming the transcript lacks information on adherence and dosing changes, whereas the Gold Answer and transcript explicitly detail skipping evening doses and the failure to refill the rescue inhaler.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses approximately 50% of the Gold Answer's key points. It fails to mention the twice-daily prescription vs. morning-only usage, the fact that the rescue inhaler has not been refilled in years, and that the patient currently lacks a rescue inhaler.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source by stating that information is missing when it is clearly present in segments P-17, P-18, and P-19. It also references an external 'Knowledge Graph' not provided in the source transcript, and includes an incorrect citation for Tylenol (citing P-26 instead of P-27).",
    "relevance": "The first section regarding medications is relevant. However, the second section fails to address the specific question about adherence changes over the past couple of years, instead pivoting to current symptom presentation and the doctor's future plan."
