    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab as the diagnostic test ordered and accurately cites [D-53]. However, it provides an incomplete and partially incorrect rationale. While it mentions the husband's symptoms, it misses the critical epidemiological reasoning about household transmission being the primary driver ('if your husband got it, and you have it'). The Generated Answer incorrectly emphasizes symptom-based prioritization over the transmission pattern, which was the doctor's actual rationale. The Gold Answer clearly centers on household transmission as the key distinguishing factor for prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of the Gold Answer's key points. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test and mentions the husband's involvement. However, it omits several important elements: (1) the explicit household transmission pattern as the primary rationale, (2) the temporal sequence (husband sick for a week, then patient developed symptoms), (3) the self-isolation instruction as evidence of transmission concern, (4) the specific quote about husband-to-patient transmission being the reason for prioritizing COVID-19, and (5) the context that influenza was only mentioned after COVID-19 discussion and learning about lack of flu shot.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful to the transcript with accurate citations. However, it introduces a problematic interpretation by stating the patient 'likely became infected via the husband' as established fact, when the transcript only indicates concurrent illness. The claim about symptoms being the primary basis for prioritizing COVID-19 is somewhat misleading, as the transcript shows transmission pattern was more central to the doctor's reasoning. The reference to a 'Knowledge Graph' is concerning as this was not provided in the source materials, raising questions about potential hallucination of external information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question (diagnostic test and rationale for prioritization). However, it focuses disproportionately on symptom-based reasoning rather than the epidemiological/transmission-based rationale that was central to the doctor's actual decision-making. The answer remains on-topic throughout but misallocates emphasis, making it less relevant to what the question actually seeks regarding the doctor's specific reasoning process."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test but provides an incomplete and partially misdirected rationale. While it mentions relevant elements like the husband's symptoms and general clinical reasoning, it fails to capture the core epidemiological reasoning centered on household transmission that the doctor explicitly stated as the primary reason for prioritizing COVID-19. The answer is factually accurate in what it includes but misses critical contextual elements and overemphasizes symptom-based reasoning over transmission patterns. The reference to an unprovided 'Knowledge Graph' raises faithfulness concerns."
