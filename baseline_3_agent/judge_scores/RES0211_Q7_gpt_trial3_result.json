  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the first-noted symptom (scratchy throat) followed by dry cough, consistent with [P-4]. It also correctly characterizes the “feeling hot” as persistent and notes the clinician’s later summary of “a little bit of fever” [D-58]. However, it slightly over-interprets timing by stating the heat occurred “concurrently” with the throat/cough; the transcript does not specify whether the heat began at the same time versus later within the same 3–4 day window.",
    "completeness": "Covers: scratchy throat first, then dry cough; feeling hot persistent and not clearly before/after throat/cough; clinician summary as fever. Misses: the rest of the symptom progression described in the gold answer (head pounding/headache, malaise/feeling crappy overall, fatigue) and the framing of progression from localized respiratory symptoms to more systemic symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are supported by the transcript (scratchy throat → cough [P-4]; feeling hot all the time day and night [P-7, P-9]; “little bit of fever” in summary [D-58]). The only mild ungrounded element is implying simultaneity (“concurrently”) rather than stating that onset relative to cough/throat is unspecified.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the asked ordering (throat then cough) and explains how ‘feeling hot’ relates to the cough/throat timeline. It remains focused, though it omits several symptoms that are part of the overall progression referenced in the question."

  "summary": "Accurately captures the initial throat-to-cough sequence and the persistent ‘feeling hot’ symptom, but is somewhat incomplete about the broader symptom progression and slightly overstates the timing relationship of feeling hot to the respiratory symptoms."
