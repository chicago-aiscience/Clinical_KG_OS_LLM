  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer contains several inaccuracies or misleading statements:\n- It does not correctly report the key quantified change in bronchodilator use (baseline “once every two weeks” to current “almost everyday… five six times a week”). Instead it stays qualitative (“using it a lot now”).\n- It states the cough has been “over the past week” and does not include the later clarification to “last two weeks.”\n- It misattributes chest tightness confirmation: it cites [P-4] (“Yeah” to PRN bronchodilator) instead of [P-20] (chest tightness).\n- It implies the current exacerbation is “triggered by” cold/pollen/exertion; while these are reported triggers in general, the transcript does not explicitly identify them as the cause of this particular 2-week flare.\n- “Diagnosis of asthma exacerbation” is a reasonable clinical interpretation but is not explicitly stated in the transcript.\nOverall, some symptom descriptions are correct (dry cough, SOB, wheeze), but key facts and citations are wrong or missing.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered vs missed:\n- Covered: dry cough and SOB; wheezing; mentions cold air/exercise/spring pollen as triggers.\n- Missed: explicit temporal framing from diagnosis at age 8 to current age 10 (2-year history); baseline rescue use “maybe once every two weeks”; current near-daily use quantified as “five six times a week”; clarification that symptoms have been present for 2 weeks (not just 1); note that wheezing episodes occur even more often than bronchodilator use (uses inhaler only when very hard to breathe); nighttime symptoms every other day/every two days; lack of infectious precipitant after screening/denials.\nBecause multiple central elements of the asked evolution (especially the baseline and current frequency numbers and timeline) are omitted, coverage is well under 50%.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not well-grounded in the transcript or are incorrectly cited:\n- Incorrect citation for chest tightness (uses [P-4] rather than [P-20]).\n- “Knowledge Graph inference” is not part of the transcript.\n- Asserting the current exacerbation is “triggered by external factors” overstates what was said (triggers were discussed generally, not as the identified cause of this flare).\n- “Diagnosis of asthma exacerbation” is interpretive rather than directly stated.\nSome statements are faithful (dry cough, SOB, wheeze; triggers exist), but the above issues reduce grounding substantially.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays on asthma symptoms and bronchodilator use, but it does not directly answer the question’s requested longitudinal evolution (diagnosis at 8 → baseline once/2 weeks → current 2-week exacerbation with 5–6x/week use). It provides partial, mostly symptomatic content and triggers rather than a clear time-based progression."
