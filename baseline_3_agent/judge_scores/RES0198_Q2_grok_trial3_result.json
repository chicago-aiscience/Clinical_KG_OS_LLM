  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately reports the patient tried 'decongestants' [P-10], matching Gold. Effectiveness assessment as 'working a little bit' with implication of relieving stuffiness due to nose now running closely aligns with Gold's description of 'helped a little bit' and the transitional reasoning [P-10]. Doctor's OTC recommendation of 'Tylenol cold' [D-39] matches Gold exactly. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers: patient tried decongestants [P-10]; assessment 'worked a little bit' with reasoning on stuffiness to runny [P-10]; OTC 'Tylenol cold' [D-39]. Misses from Gold: supportive care details like 'well hydrated'; expectations of 'a few weeks' for resolution and 'not much beyond supportive care' [D-39]. Covers core question elements but ~80% of Gold's elaborated points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'decongestants' and patient quote/paraphrase in [P-10]; 'Tylenol cold' exactly in [D-39]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question (medication tried, effectiveness assessment, doctor's OTC recommendation) with no off-topic content."
