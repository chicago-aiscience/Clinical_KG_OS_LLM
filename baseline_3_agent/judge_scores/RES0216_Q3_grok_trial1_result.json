  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's statement in D-35 as placing asthma recurrence at the top of the differential and links symptoms like chest tightness and exertional worsening to asthma history, while excluding cardiac causes via absence of pain (D-36). However, it inaccurately portrays salbutamol as currently taken without noting it's the rescue inhaler not refilled (P-17/P-18 contradiction with P-25), omits the key medication non-compliance (skipping evening dose P-19, D-34), patient's acknowledgment it could be related (P-16), no new triggers (P-33), and therapeutic trial (D-35). Core facts align but with notable omissions and minor misrepresentations compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) D-35 top differential; (2) asthma history [P-16,P-29]; (3) med limiting [P-17-19,D-34]; (4) symptoms tightness/exertion [P-1,7,9,10]; (5) patient notes could be related [P-16]; (6) no triggers [P-33]; (7) no cardiac indicators [D-36]; (8) rescue trial [D-35]. Generated covers: (1) yes, (2) partial, (4) yes, (7) yes; adds hoarseness/phlegm [P-11] not key in Gold. Misses (3),(5),(6),(8) entirely. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: symptoms [P-1,7,9,11], history [P-16,25], no pain/out of breath nuance [D-36,P-7], links [D-35,36]. Salbutamol mention accurate per P-25 but contextually overlooks non-refill; no fabrications, phlegm/hoarseness directly from transcript. Minor overemphasis on exclusion but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring around symptoms, history, clinical features (exclusions), and explicit linking to asthma top diagnosis, mirroring question's focus without off-topic content."
