  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists current statin [P-14,P-15], no allergies [P-16,P-17], past antibiotics for tick bite [P-3], prophylactic antibiotics proposed [D-6,D-13,D-18] with no specifics and physician consult [D-13,D-22], and insecticide suggestion [D-18]. Generated covers statin accurately, prophylactic antibiotics (core fact correct), and insecticide. Misses past antibiotics and no allergies (minor omissions), includes accurate diagnostics (tick lab, blood work [D-6,D-18], physical exam [D-18]) also in Gold implicitly. Minor issues: extraneous [KG] citation and slight citation inaccuracy (D-5 not directly for prophylaxis). Core facts consistent, minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: current statin (covered), no allergies (missed), past antibiotics (missed), prophylactic abx proposal/rationale/no specifics/consult (covered), tick lab/blood work (covered via Generated's diagnostics), insecticide (covered). Covers ~85% of points, including all main medications/treatments; misses secondary details like allergies and past history.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims verifiable: statin [P-14,P-15], abx prophylaxis [D-6,D-18], tick lab [D-6,D-18], blood work [D-18], exam [D-18], insecticide [D-18]. Minor issues: [KG] hallucinated citation (not in transcript), D-5 miscited (describes tick, not prophylaxis). No major fabrications, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications (statin, antibiotics) and treatments (prophylactics, diagnostics, prevention) for tick bite and statin therapy as per question; structured response focused on discussed items, no off-topic content."
