  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition to rule out (COVID-19) and the ordered test (a COVID swab), consistent with [D-43]. However, it is factually incorrect in stating the transcript contains no details about recent social contacts: the patient explicitly reports meeting friends for dog walks and that one friend was “a bit sick for a bit,” with occasional close proximity [P-20]. The added rationale that the doctor mentioned ruling out COVID because of symptoms like cough/SOB/fever is not stated as the explicit prompt in the transcript and does not answer the social-contact part as asked.",
    "completeness": "Covers 2 of 3 required elements (condition + test). It omits/misstates the key prompting social-contact detail from the Gold Answer: sick friend during outdoor dog walks, sometimes walking too close, and uncertainty about whether the friend had a COVID test [P-20, D-21, P-21]. It also omits the additional COVID screening questions (smell/taste, etc.), which are supporting details in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Not fully grounded: the claim that there are no social-contact details contradicts the transcript (social contact exposure is present at [P-20]). The explanation given instead (symptoms suggesting infection) is only loosely supported and does not reflect the transcript’s stated prompt (exposure history was elicited and COVID swab planned).",
    "relevance": "Mostly addresses the question format (condition, test, prompting detail), but fails on the crucial third part by denying the existence of the social-contact prompt and substituting a different rationale. This reduces how directly it answers what was asked."
