  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the use of occasional Reactine (OTC) for seasonal allergies, no medications for the current respiratory episode, and no prescribed medications, aligning with the Gold Answer's core facts from [P-35], [P-36], [P-46], and [P-47]. Minor discrepancies include incorrectly stating the current episode is a 'viral infection' (P-15 refers to past infections, not current), implying Reactine is 'currently part of her regimen' (Gold specifies 'occasional' or 'intermittent'), and referencing a non-existent '[KG]' for Reactine details. However, no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36], no meds for current respiratory episode (inferred from lack of mention and evaluation context), no prescribed medications [P-36]. Misses explicit mention of episodes resolving on their own with rest [P-33, P-34] and past viral infections requiring no antibiotics [P-16]. Approximately 80-90% coverage of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: Reactine and OTC for allergies [P-36], seasonal allergies [P-35], no prescribed [P-36], no specific meds for current episode. Unverifiable/hallucinated elements include 'viral infection' for current symptoms (P-15 is past), '[KG]' reference (no knowledge graph in transcript), and 'self-administered OTC rather than prescribed alternatives' (plausible but interpretive). Some claims not directly in transcript but plausible.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing medications (Reactine OTC for allergies), confirming none for current respiratory episodes, and explicitly stating no prescribed medications, with a clear summary. No off-topic content."
