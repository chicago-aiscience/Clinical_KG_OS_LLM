  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and perfectly aligns with the gold answer regarding the diagnostic test (COVID swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours), isolation period (14 days), and the list of emergency warning signs.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer addresses all the specific sub-questions in the prompt. However, compared to the gold answer, it omits the doctor's mention of a hypothetical differential (asthma) that would have been considered if fever were absent, and does not explicitly state that no medications were prescribed.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely grounded in the transcript, using correct citations for the diagnostic test, isolation advice, and warning signs.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses every part of the question without including irrelevant information."
