  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Key factual errors vs Gold Answer: (1) It states wheezing began “without a reported acute trigger,” but the trigger is explicitly physical activity (playing tag) with becoming quite out of breath [P-3]. (2) It implies progression/worsening dyspnea over time; the transcript describes wheeze and difficulty taking deep breaths from the start [P-2] with episodic fluctuation rather than clear worsening. (3) It claims the transcript does not explicitly detail a nocturnal event, but there is a clearly described single night episode of wheeziness that resolved and caused trouble falling asleep [P-43–P-44]. Some correct elements remain (4–5 days duration, cold weather/exertion as exacerbators, cough present). Overall, significant contradictions to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Missed or inadequately covered Gold Answer elements: (1) the core fluctuating/episodic pattern with resolution on its own and recurrence with activity, improving with rest [P-5–P-6]; (2) clear temporal sequencing that cough emerged after wheeze/breathlessness were established [P-1, P-2]; (3) cough being non-productive/no phlegm [P-31]; (4) the single nocturnal episode details (wheeze at night, resolved, trouble falling asleep) [P-43–P-44]—it incorrectly denies this; (5) pertinent negatives (no fever [P-7], no cyanosis [P-32], looks fine otherwise [P-9]). It includes some correct points (duration, exertion/cold as triggers, seasonal allergies), but overall covers well under half of the key requested progression details.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: (1) “initially began without a reported acute trigger” contradicts [P-3]; (2) claiming no explicit nocturnal event contradicts [P-43–P-44]. It also introduces interpretive framing (“progression in severity”) not clearly supported. Other included details (past viral infections, seasonal allergies, Reactine) are in the transcript but are tangential to the question. Due to multiple contradictions/misrepresentations, grounding is weak.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address onset, triggers, pattern, cough, and nocturnal symptoms, but it adds tangential material (past infections, allergy management) and critically mishandles the nocturnal episode and initial trigger, which are central to the question. Thus it is only partially responsive to the asked symptom-evolution narrative."
