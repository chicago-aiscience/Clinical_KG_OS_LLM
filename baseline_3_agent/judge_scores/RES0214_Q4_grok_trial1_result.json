  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53], matching the Gold Answer. For rationale, it captures the doctor's quote [D-53] linking to the husband and symptoms, but emphasizes symptoms more than the Gold's focus on epidemiological household transmission; no major contradictions, but minor shift in emphasis and addition of unverified 'potential exposure' details.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: test/swab [D-53] (yes), household transmission via husband [P-19, D-53] (yes, mentioned), self-isolate instruction [D-53, D-54] (no), explicit prioritization quote (partial yes), flu as secondary after no flu shot [P-53, D-54] (no, influenza barely addressed). Covers ~60-70% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Quotes from transcript accurate [D-53, P-1]; inferences like 'likely infected via husband' grounded. However, repeated mentions of 'Knowledge Graph' confirming links and procedures are not in transcript—hallucinated external reference, introducing multiple unverifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of question with structured sections on test and rationale; minor irrelevant Knowledge Graph tangents but overall focused on query."
