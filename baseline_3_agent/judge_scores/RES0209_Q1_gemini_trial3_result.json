  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It states the cough lasted 'a lot over the past week or so' based on P-1, whereas the transcript later clarifies (D-13, P-13) that the symptoms have lasted for two weeks. Most importantly, it claims the transcript lacks details on nighttime symptoms, which is incorrect; the patient explicitly describes nighttime frequency in P-18 ('every other day or like you know, every two days or so'). Additionally, it cites P-4 for chest tightness, but P-4 refers to bronchodilator use; chest tightness is confirmed in P-20.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the four main symptoms requested (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness). However, it completely fails to provide the requested comparison between daytime and nighttime frequency, incorrectly asserting the information is unavailable.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits a 'hallucination of absence' by stating the transcript does not contain nighttime symptom details. These details are clearly present in turn P-18. The citation for chest tightness [P-4] is also unfaithful to the actual dialogue sequence [P-20].",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in its structure and successfully addresses the first half of the prompt regarding specific symptoms. It attempts to address the second half (frequency difference) but fails to provide the data."
