  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemic conditions as being placed lower on the differential diagnosis. It accurately cites the doctor's statement from [D-36] and correctly identifies the key symptom findings mentioned. However, it omits several important details present in the Gold Answer, including: (1) the patient's explicit denial of chest pain at [P-5], (2) the absence of anxiety, sweating, or feeling of impending doom mentioned at [P-6] and [D-6], and (3) the doctor's more nuanced characterization of breathlessness. The core facts are correct but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemic) and references the primary evidence (tightness vs. pain, lack of exertional dyspnea). However, it misses several important elements: (1) the systematic screening for cardiac red flags (anxiety, sweating, impending doom), (2) the patient's relief statement at [P-35], (3) the more detailed characterization of the tightness being respiratory-related (\"when I breathe in\"), and (4) the explicit mention that the patient denied chest pain multiple times. The answer captures the main point but lacks the comprehensive detail of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citation of [D-36] is accurate, and the quotes from [P-1] are faithful to the source material. The answer does not introduce any hallucinated facts or unsupported claims. The characterization of 'chest tightness' and absence of pain are both directly grounded in the transcript. The citations are appropriately used and accurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying the specific condition (cardiac ischemic), the nature of chest complaints (tightness without pain, not truly exertional dyspnea), and mentioning the absence of pain. It stays focused on what was asked and does not include irrelevant information. However, it could have been more complete in addressing 'the absence of certain symptoms' plural, as the question specifically asks about this."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemic conditions as the diagnosis placed lower on the differential and accurately cites the main evidence (tightness vs. pain, lack of classic exertional symptoms). All claims are faithfully grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it omits several important supporting details present in the Gold Answer, including the systematic screening for cardiac red flags (anxiety, sweating, impending doom), multiple explicit pain denials, and the patient's relief statement. While factually accurate and relevant, the answer covers only about 50-60% of the key points, making it incomplete though correct in its core content."
