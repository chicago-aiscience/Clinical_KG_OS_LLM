  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the core elements of the plan in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation measurement with oxygen if needed, continuation of bronchodilators, and addition of steroids and antibiotics, plus a COVID swab. No statements contradict the Gold Answer. Minor categorization differences (placing COVID swab under “Monitoring” rather than labs) do not create factual error, and the mention that the bronchodilators are Ventolin and Spiriva is supported by [P-11].",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points from the Gold Answer: all major labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs), imaging (CXR), monitoring (O2 sat), COVID swab, and treatments (oxygen PRN, bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics). Missing items from Gold Answer include: (1) the stated turnaround time for COVID results (24–48 hours) and (2) the additional note about ongoing blood pressure monitoring from [D-37] mentioned in the Gold Answer as part of monitoring/plan context.",
    "faithfulness": "All included elements are supported directly by the transcript: the tests and treatments come from [D-52], and the identification of Ventolin/Spiriva is from [P-11]. No clear hallucinated diagnostics or therapies are added.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing labs, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions for the COPD exacerbation plan, with no meaningful tangents."
