  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the use of a statin and the proposal of prophylactic antibiotics. However, it slightly misrepresents the timeline logic regarding the 72-hour window: it states 'if the tick was present from Friday to Saturday (at least 72 hours)', whereas the transcript implies that because the patient was out on Friday/Saturday and it is now the time of the consultation, the duration has exceeded 72 hours. Friday to Saturday is only 24-48 hours. Additionally, it cites [D-5] for antibiotics, but antibiotics are first mentioned in [D-6].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it does not mention the patient's past history of taking antibiotics for a tick bite 10 years ago, it omits the confirmation that the patient has no drug allergies, and it fails to mention the doctor's intent to consult with a supervising physician. It does, however, include diagnostic measures (blood work, physical exam) mentioned in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is generally well-grounded in the transcript. The mention of 'medical knowledge graph [KG]' is an external reference not present in the transcript but supports a fact already stated in the text. The citations are mostly accurate, though [D-5] is slightly misapplied to the antibiotic discussion.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the medications (statin, antibiotics) and treatments (insecticide, diagnostics) discussed in the consultation as requested by the prompt."
