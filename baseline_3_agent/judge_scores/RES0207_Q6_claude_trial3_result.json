  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect. It claims there are 'no doctor turns' in the transcript and that it 'cuts off prior to the conclusion,' which is factually wrong. The transcript clearly contains doctor turns [D-1] through [D-38], including the critical final turns [D-37] and [D-38] where the doctor explicitly outlines next steps. The Generated Answer contradicts the Gold Answer on basic factual content.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not mention: (1) that the doctor will consult with another physician, (2) that they will return shortly, (3) that tests may be ordered, (4) that a management plan will be discussed, or (5) any of the specific dialogue references. It covers 0% of the required content because it incorrectly claims the information doesn't exist.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a significant hallucination by claiming the transcript only contains patient turns [P-1] through [P-26] and no doctor turns. This is demonstrably false as the transcript clearly shows doctor turns throughout, including [D-37] and [D-38] which are crucial to answering the question. The speculative 'potential course of action' section adds ungrounded clinical interpretations not requested.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. Instead of identifying the next steps communicated by the doctor, it incorrectly claims the information is absent from the transcript. The speculative clinical inferences about medication management and symptom investigation are tangential and not what was asked for."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect and fails on all evaluation dimensions. It falsely claims the transcript contains no doctor turns and that the consultation ending is missing, when in fact turns [D-37] and [D-38] clearly contain the requested information about next steps. This fundamental factual error results in zero coverage of the Gold Answer's key points, complete lack of relevance to the question, and includes hallucinated content about what the transcript contains."
