  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately quotes and paraphrases the doctor's assessment from [D-43] matching the Gold Answer exactly. It correctly identifies the two diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray) directly from [D-43], and precisely restates the isolation instructions, including the condition for continuation (symptoms persist even if test negative), with no factual errors or contradictions to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: assessment (symptoms in line with COVID-19), specific tests (COVID swab, chest X-ray), isolation until results, continued isolation if symptomatic even if negative. Missed: contextual reasons for X-ray (breathing difficulty [P-8,P-9,P-10], COPD [P-27]), framing as 'heads up', consulting supervising doctor [D-1,D-44], patient acknowledgment [P-43,P-44]. Covers core elements (approx. 85%), but omits supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-43] of the transcript: assessment phrasing, tests (swab, xray), isolation until results and potentially after if symptomatic even if negative. Citations accurate; no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured to directly address the question's components (assessment, tests, isolation instructions, conditions for continued isolation) with no off-topic content, perfectly matching the query's focus."
