  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states that 'The provided transcript does not contain evidence that the doctor used an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map' when in fact the doctor explicitly references checking the Lyme disease distribution map at [D-13], stating 'I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up' and concludes 'Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.' This is a major omission that directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the source material.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only about 50% of the key points. It correctly addresses the 72-hour attachment duration calculation based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening, but completely misses the critical geographic risk assessment using the distribution map. The Gold Answer explicitly includes both elements: the timeline calculation AND the geographic justification via the Lyme disease distribution map. The Generated Answer's claim that no geographic map was used is factually incorrect.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer demonstrates poor faithfulness. While it accurately cites some parts of the transcript regarding the 72-hour calculation, it makes a false claim that contradicts transcript evidence at [D-13]. The doctor clearly states he will check the Lyme disease distribution map and reports findings about Strathroy's position. This is a hallucinated negative - claiming something didn't happen when it verifiably did occur in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but provides an incomplete and partially incorrect response. It properly discusses the 72-hour attachment duration component but incorrectly denies the geographic map component, which is central to the question being asked. The answer is partially relevant but fails to fully address both parts of the two-part question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the 72-hour attachment calculation based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening but makes a critical factual error by claiming the doctor did not use an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map to justify prophylactic treatment. The transcript clearly shows at [D-13] that the doctor explicitly references checking the distribution map and determines that 'Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point,' which directly influenced the decision to move forward with antibiotics. This major omission and factual error significantly undermines the answer's correctness, completeness, and faithfulness to the source material."
