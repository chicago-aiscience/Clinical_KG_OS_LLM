  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Core points align with the Gold Answer: the patient is not currently taking prescribed meds; past anxiety medication was stopped 2–3 years ago; reflux is managed with diet; patient is requesting something for cough. However, the answer introduces an unsupported claim that the patient is managing anxiety non‑pharmacologically by avoiding triggers/foods (this is not stated in the transcript and incorrectly links reflux dietary avoidance to anxiety). It also characterizes reflux management as “strict dietary restrictions,” which overstates what was said.",
    "completeness": "Includes: no current anxiety meds; prior anxiety med stopped 2–3 years ago; reflux managed by avoiding trigger foods; patient requesting cough medication. Misses/underserves: (1) explicit across-all-conditions summary that they are on zero medications; (2) hay fever noted as an allergy with no treatment described; (3) that no cough medication was prescribed/recommended yet because next steps are exam + discuss with supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded with citations (reflux diet, prior anxiety meds, request for cough meds). But the anxiety self-management claim is not supported by the transcript and represents a notable hallucination/inference. COVID-related content (negative test, PPE) is in the transcript, though it’s not central to the medication-status question.",
    "relevance": "Mostly addresses the question (current meds and what they’re doing for reflux, whether taking prescribed meds). Some tangents: adds COVID “treatment status” and extra cough symptom detail beyond medication/treatment status, but still loosely related to clinical context."
