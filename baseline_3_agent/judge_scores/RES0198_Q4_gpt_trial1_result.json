{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, correctly states that a swab test was ordered, gives the correct expected turnaround time (48 hours), and accurately reports the isolation instructions while awaiting results. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "It includes: (1) COVID-19 to rule out, (2) swab ordered today, (3) 48-hour turnaround, and (4) isolate at home/avoid others. It omits the additional instruction that after results return the patient would get further instructions from public health. Thus it covers most but not all key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript (P-1, D-39). It does not introduce new or unsupported claims. The only issue is an omission (public health follow-up), not hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what was asked: condition to rule out, test ordered, turnaround time, and instructions while awaiting results, with no extraneous tangents."
