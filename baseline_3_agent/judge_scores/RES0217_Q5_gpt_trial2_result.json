  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The first part (timeline/attachment duration) is largely consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer: the patient was outdoors Friday and Saturday and removed the tick “earlier today,” and the doctor explicitly inferred this could mean “longer than at least 72 hours” (D-6). However, the Generated Answer incorrectly claims there is no evidence the doctor used an Ontario Lyme distribution map or Strathroy’s position to justify prophylaxis. This directly contradicts D-13 (“Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario… Strathroy is close enough… concerning… moving forward with antibiotics”). This is a major factual error on a key part of the question.",
    "completeness": "Covers the attachment-duration reasoning (Friday/Saturday exposure leading doctor to estimate >72 hours and to consider prophylactic antibiotics). It largely omits/misrepresents the geographic-risk justification: the Gold Answer emphasizes the Ontario Lyme map and Strathroy being “close enough” to be concerning (D-13), which the Generated Answer denies. It also adds non-key elements (tick habitat, symptoms) that are not central to the asked justification. Overall, it captures roughly half of the required key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: most notably the assertion that the transcript does not contain evidence of the Ontario Lyme map use, which is explicitly present in D-13. Additional framing (e.g., that the doctor’s justification relied ‘primarily’ on gardening/long grass and symptom presentation) is not aligned with the cited rationale for prophylaxis in the transcript (duration and geographic risk).",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to answer both components (duration estimate and geographic map justification), but the second component is answered incorrectly and includes some tangential material (tick habitat, symptom tenderness) not asked. Still, the content is generally on-topic regarding tick exposure and prophylaxis rationale."
