  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by stating that the transcript does not contain information regarding Jessica's father, her cousin's asthma, the farm living situation, home-schooling, or COVID-19. All of these details are explicitly present in the provided transcript (P-30, P-33, P-41, P-42, P-43, P-55). It correctly identifies the brother's cold and Jessica's symptoms but fails on the contextual analysis.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the majority of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to discuss the family history (father/cousin) and the environmental context (farm/COVID/isolation), which were specifically requested in the prompt. It only covers the brother's cold and Jessica's own medical history.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly here by claiming information is missing from the source text when it is clearly available. This indicates a failure to ground the response in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it ignores several specific components of the multi-part question. By claiming the context is missing, it avoids addressing how those factors collectively relate to her symptoms."
