  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain the doctor's plan, whereas turn [D-43] explicitly outlines the next steps (consulting with a supervisor). It also misses major findings regarding chest pain and breathing, though the mention of Tylenol and raw throat from coughing is accurate.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The doctor's plan to consult a supervising physician. 2) Self-care through expectoration ('gunk') and resting. 3) Specific aggravating factors explicitly asked for in the question (deep breathing and physical exertion). 4) Alleviating factors beyond Tylenol.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails to find information clearly present in the text (the plan) and references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not part of the provided transcript context, suggesting a hallucination or reliance on external training data rather than the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer uses the correct headers to address the question components, but it fails to include the specific examples (physical exertion and deep breathing) that were requested in the prompt's parentheses."
