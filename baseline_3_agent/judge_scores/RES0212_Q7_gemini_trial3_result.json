  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the initial onset (3 months), the appearance of greenish sputum (past few days), and the subjective fevers (past couple of days). However, it incorrectly states that nightly sleep disruption began in the last three days. The patient explicitly states in transcript [P-19] and [P-21] that the cough has been waking her up every night for the last month. The generated answer misinterprets the doctor's summary in [D-47] as the start date for this symptom, contradicting the patient's testimony.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all four specific milestones requested in the prompt: initial onset, sleep disruption, productive sputum, and fevers.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the cough started waking the patient up 'at night' only in the last three days is unfaithful to the transcript. While the doctor mentions it in his summary [D-47], the patient's own report in [P-21] confirms this has been happening for a month. The generated answer creates a distinction between 'mild wakefulness' and 'waking up' that is not supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address each part of the timeline requested in the prompt."
