  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies fever and sore throat as key symptoms prompting concern for an infectious cause and COVID-19 workup (matches D-53), and it correctly states that lack of a flu shot led the clinician to consider influenza (D-53 to D-54). It additionally includes “stuffy nose” as part of the symptom set prompting suspicion; while the clinician explicitly highlighted fever+sore throat, stuffy nose was also part of the clinician’s symptom summary (D-24), so this is not incorrect. No major contradictions with the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold answer key points: (1) fever and sore throat as explicit trigger for infectious concern; (2) broader viral syndrome cluster including muscle aches/stuffy nose; (3) epidemiologic context: husband with similar symptoms supporting COVID-19 concern; (4) flu shot status (not vaccinated) prompting influenza consideration. Generated answer covers (1) and (4) and partially covers (2) (includes stuffy nose but omits muscle aches). It omits (3) entirely (husband with similar symptoms as a reason COVID was prioritized).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are largely supported by the transcript and the citations provided (P-1, D-53, P-53, D-54). The phrase “based on the provided transcript and knowledge graph” introduces an element not present in the transcript, but it does not materially affect the clinical content. No major hallucinated clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (symptoms prompting infectious/COVID suspicion and the vaccination-history detail prompting influenza in the differential). Minimal extraneous content."
