  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect and directly contradicts the transcript. It claims there is 'no explicit evidence' of the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, or nausea, despite these being clearly present in the transcript (D-10/P-10, D-15/P-15, D-16/P-16, D-17/P-17).",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to list the symptoms that were negated, which was the primary requirement of the question. Instead, it lists confirmed symptoms and then erroneously claims the negated ones were not discussed.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits significant hallucinations regarding the content of the transcript. It falsely asserts that the interaction does not record specific denials of the symptoms listed in the prompt, whereas the transcript contains a systematic review of systems where these were explicitly denied.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely irrelevant because it fails to address the specific question about negated symptoms and provides a diagnostic explanation based on a false premise (that the denials were missing)."
