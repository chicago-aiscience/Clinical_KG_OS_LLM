  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has several factual inaccuracies compared to the Gold Answer: it misquotes P-15 as 'had a big appetite right now' when the mother actually said 'doesn't seem to have a big appetite'; presents shortness of breath as reported/inferred when Gold notes it as uncertain; omits runny nose; includes irrelevant family history as a denied symptom; specifies fever only as 'over 100' without Gold's detail of ~100.1-101°F or progression; adds unsubstantiated link to 'knowledge graph' not in transcript. Core symptoms like dry cough, fever, fatigue, and loss of taste are correct, but significant errors in representation and omissions make it inconsistent.",
    "completeness": "Key reported points from Gold covered partially: dry cough (yes), fever (partial), fatigue (yes), decreased appetite (mentioned but misquoted), loss of taste (yes); misses runny nose entirely, underplays uncertainty of SOB. Denied symptoms: covers chest pain and partial GI (diarrhea/constipation/blood), but misses sputum/blood, wheezing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, skin changes, nausea/vomiting, urine changes, dizziness, confusion; adds irrelevant family history. Covers ~30-40% of key points (5/19 approx.).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded with citations, but hallucinations include misquoting P-15 on appetite, inventing 'knowledge graph' reference (absent from transcript), overstating SOB as reported (P-8 is 'I don't think so... maybe tired'), and linking tiredness to SOB causally (not in transcript). Multiple unverifiable/misrepresented details.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and denied symptoms, addressing the question; minor tangents like family history and knowledge graph, but mostly focused."
