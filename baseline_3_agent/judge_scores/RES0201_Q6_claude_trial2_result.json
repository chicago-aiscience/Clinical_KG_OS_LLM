  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: (1) the assessment that symptoms align with COVID-19, (2) both diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), (3) isolation until results return, and (4) the critical condition that isolation may continue even with negative results if symptoms persist. The facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and the source transcript, with no contradictions or errors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components from the Gold Answer: the assessment, both diagnostic tests, initial isolation instructions, and conditions for continued isolation. However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as: the specific rationale for the chest X-ray (difficulty breathing and underlying COPD), the doctor's statement about consulting with a supervising physician, and the patient's acknowledgment of the plan. These omissions are relatively minor but prevent full completeness. Coverage is approximately 85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the source transcript with accurate citations to [D-43]. The answer does not introduce any hallucinated facts or make claims unsupported by the transcript. The use of direct quotes (e.g., 'in line with common symptoms of covid 19') and specific citation markers demonstrates strong grounding in the source material. No fabricated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses all components of the question: overall assessment, management plan with specific diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, and conditions for continued isolation. The answer is well-structured with clear headings that map to the question's elements. There is no irrelevant content or tangential information. The response stays perfectly focused on answering what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-organized response that correctly identifies all key factual elements from the source material. It demonstrates perfect correctness and faithfulness with proper citations, and maintains complete relevance to the question. The only minor limitation is the omission of some contextual details present in the Gold Answer (such as the clinical rationale for tests and consultation notes), which slightly reduces completeness. Overall, this is a high-quality response that effectively addresses the clinical question."
