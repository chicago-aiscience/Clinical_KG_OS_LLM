  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly focuses on affirmed symptoms (SOB, dry cough, fever) and medication non-adherence as 'screened for,' while the Gold Answer and question emphasize denied symptoms/exposures (e.g., chest pain, feeling faint, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea, sputum). It misrepresents patient denials (only mentions denying frequent seizures, which is minor) and infers DDs from positives rather than negatives, contradicting Gold's factual listing and interpretation; core facts about denied screenings are absent or wrong.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: none fully; missed all major denied symptoms (chest pain, faintness, URI symptoms, exposures, GI symptoms, dry cough confirmation, no prior episodes). Generated covers 0% of these, instead discussing affirmed presenting complaints and unrelated seizure frequency.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about screened symptoms (SOB, cough, fever) are verifiable but irrelevant to denials; missed Keppra dose verifiable [P-9, P-24]; denial of frequent seizures verifiable but minor. Hallucinations include specific DDs like pneumonia, bronchitis, pulmonary edema, PE, GERD/aspiration not in transcript or suggested by negatives; doctor screened to RULE OUT infectious/cardiac/GI via denials, opposite of Generated's positive-based inferences.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer addresses reported symptoms and infers DDs from positives, largely ignoring the question's focus on denied symptoms/exposures and how negatives address DDs (e.g., cardiac via no chest pain/faintness, infectious via no URI/exposures); only tangential mention of categories without tying to negatives."
