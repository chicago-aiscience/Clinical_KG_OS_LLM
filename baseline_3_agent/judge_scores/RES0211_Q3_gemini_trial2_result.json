  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms and the logic of excluding lower respiratory and systemic infections. However, it incorrectly states that the patient did not 'explicitly list the absence' of GI symptoms or joint pain, when she did explicitly deny them in [P-11] through [P-13]. It also attributes the lack of sputum to the doctor's summary [D-58] rather than the specific questioning in [D-5] and [D-6].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two key supportive points present in the Gold Answer: the 3-4 day timeline as a typical URI duration and the brother's cold as a plausible household viral exposure. It covers about 60-70% of the reasoning points provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer mentions a 'Knowledge Graph' multiple times, which is not present in the provided transcript or context. This is a minor hallucination regarding the source of information, though the symptoms themselves are grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the prompt, explaining how both the presence and absence of specific symptoms support the URI diagnosis."
