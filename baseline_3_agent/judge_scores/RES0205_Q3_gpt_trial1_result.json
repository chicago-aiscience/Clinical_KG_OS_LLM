{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer aligns with the Gold Answer: the investigated diagnosis was COVID-19; the prompting evidence included hospital work/possible exposure, viral URI/flu-like symptoms with persistent cough, and workplace concern about coughing; and testing was negative. The added mention of cough-related chest soreness is transcript-supported and not contradictory, though it is not a key driver of COVID testing in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key Gold Answer elements: (1) COVID-19 was investigated, (2) prompted by hospital employment/exposure context, (3) initial flu-like symptoms with persistent cough, (4) coworker concern, and (5) negative test result. Misses some Gold Answer details: explicit mention that the patient wore PPE/was careful and that this did not preclude testing, and the timing/context of testing (performed at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior) and staying home awaiting improvement.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are well-grounded in the transcript with no clear hallucinations: hospital worker status, persistent cough duration, initial flu-like symptoms, coworker fear, and negative COVID test are all directly supported. The statement that COVID-19 was 'inferred' is slightly imprecise (it was explicitly stated by the patient), but does not introduce unsupported content.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question components (diagnosis investigated, evidence prompting it, and test result) without meaningful tangents."
