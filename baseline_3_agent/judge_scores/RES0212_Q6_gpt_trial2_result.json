  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the doctor’s closing summary in [D-47]: cough for a while with worsening in last three days, nocturnal awakening, greenish sputum, and no constitutional symptoms. The plan to “go review your story with the doctors” is correctly stated. The only minor issue is that it frames the information guiding next steps as the history itself, whereas the Gold Answer emphasizes that next steps would be guided by the supervising physician’s assessment after that review (i.e., the review/presentation to supervising doctors is the key driver).",
    "completeness": "Covers the major elements: (1) plan to review with other doctors, (2) summary assessment of chronic/subacute cough with recent worsening, nighttime waking, green sputum, no blood, no constitutional symptoms, and (3) that the review of the case would guide next steps. Missing or under-specified compared with the Gold Answer: that this implies a trainee presenting to a supervising physician, and that no specific tests/imaging/treatment were ordered with next steps dependent on supervisor decision.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in [D-47] and consistent with the transcript. No clear hallucinations (it does not invent tests or diagnoses). Minor lack of specificity (supervising physician aspect) is an omission rather than an ungrounded addition.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all three parts of the question (plan, assessment, what guides next steps) without tangents."
