  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the symptoms (cough, fever, headache) and the general goal (next steps) mentioned in the doctor's summary. It correctly identifies the source block [D-58]. However, it attributes the phrasing 'next steps' to Jessica identifying it, whereas the transcript shows the doctor proposed this framing and Jessica agreed before adding her specific goal about medicine.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key clinical findings that the doctor recapped in [D-58], including: the absence of sputum (not bringing anything up), the lack of sick contacts (except the brother), the absence of asthma, and the current medication list (only Claritin). It also misses Jessica's specific primary goal mentioned in [P-60] (knowing if she needs medicine) and her desire to go home and rest from [P-61]. It covers less than 50% of the detail in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is found within the transcript. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question, although with less detail than required for a full clinical recap."
