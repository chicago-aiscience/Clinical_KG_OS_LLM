  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer misattributes green-yellow sputum as indicating COPD exacerbation (citing a non-existent 'knowledge graph'), whereas Gold Answer attributes it to supporting respiratory infection as a purulent feature; it omits key COPD symptoms like increased cough frequency, sputum volume, and decreased exercise tolerance, while adding hemoptysis not highlighted in Gold; fever correctly supports infection, but overall significant factual contradictions with Gold's categorization and explanations.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: some COPD symptoms (SOB, sputum, history); infection (fever). Missed: increased cough/sputum volume, exercise intolerance for COPD; sinus pressure, headache, sick contact for infection; patient's recognition of past pattern [P-3]; exclusion of other triggers; doctor's exact framing and how sputum/fever indicate infectious trigger specifically. Covers ~20-40% of Gold points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: symptom quotes from transcript [P-1, P-9, etc.] accurate. Hallucinations: repeated references to 'knowledge graph' and its specific causal links (e.g., green sputum --> COPD exac, fever --> infection), which are not in transcript; misrepresents doctor's assessment by assigning diagnostic specificity not present.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around symptoms for COPD exac vs. infection and distinction via sputum/fever, addressing the question; minor tangent on history/smoking but focused overall."
