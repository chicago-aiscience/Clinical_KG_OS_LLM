    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor as the prescribed medication for cholesterol and Tylenol as the over-the-counter medication. However, it contains a critical transcription error stating 'haven't taken some Tylenol' when the transcript actually says 'I haven't taken some Tylenol' which should be interpreted as 'I have taken some Tylenol' based on context. The effectiveness rating of 'helps a little bit' is accurately quoted. The claim that Tylenol treats fever, sore throat, and chest pain appears to come from a knowledge graph not provided in the source materials, which is problematic.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main elements: identifies Lipitor for cholesterol and Tylenol as OTC medication with its effectiveness. However, it misses several key details from the Gold Answer: (1) It doesn't mention this is the only prescribed medication (confirmed in P-27), (2) It doesn't note Tylenol was taken 'at home', (3) It doesn't mention the non-medication relief from expectorating sputum, (4) It doesn't note the patient denied allergies, (5) It doesn't mention cannabis history, and (6) It doesn't note the patient didn't measure temperature. Coverage is approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer has faithfulness issues. The transcription error ('haven't taken' vs 'have taken') is minor but impacts meaning. More significantly, the claim about Tylenol treating 'fever, sore throat, and chest pain' references a 'knowledge graph' not present in the provided transcript. While these are common Tylenol uses, claiming they come from the knowledge graph when that information isn't in the source material represents a hallucination. The core facts about Lipitor and the effectiveness quote are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: current medications (prescribed and OTC), what conditions each treats, and effectiveness of OTC medication. It stays focused without irrelevant tangents. The structure clearly separates prescribed from OTC medications as requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key medications (Lipitor for cholesterol and Tylenol for symptom relief) and accurately quotes the effectiveness ('helps a little bit'). However, it has significant weaknesses: (1) contains a transcription error that could affect interpretation, (2) references a 'knowledge graph' not present in source materials to justify Tylenol's indications, which constitutes hallucination, (3) misses important contextual details like confirmation this is the only prescribed medication, non-pharmacological relief measures, and relevant negative findings. While highly relevant to the question, the faithfulness and completeness issues lower the overall quality."
