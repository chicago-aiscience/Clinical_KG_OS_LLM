  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms, the COVID-19 assessment, the swab test, the isolation instructions, and the timeline. However, it explicitly states that the transcript does not mention a plan to consult a supervising physician or additional tests, which is factually incorrect as per transcript segment [D-40].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two specific requirements of the prompt: the mention of possible additional tests and the plan to consult with a supervising physician. Both were clearly stated in the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a false claim about the absence of information in the source text. Claiming the transcript does not mention a supervisor or additional tests when it specifically does [D-40] is an error in grounding.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses all parts of the multi-part question, although it incorrectly answers the final sections by claiming the information is missing."
