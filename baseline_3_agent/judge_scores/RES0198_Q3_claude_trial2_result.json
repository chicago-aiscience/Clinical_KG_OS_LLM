  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core evidence supporting a viral diagnosis, including symptom presentation (stuffy/runny nose), symptom evolution (stuffiness to rhinorrhea), duration (one week), and the doctor's explicit statement. However, it omits critical differentiating evidence mentioned in the Gold Answer: (1) absence of features arguing against viral infection (no cough, sore throat, fever, chills, shortness of breath), (2) clear discharge quality (vs. colored discharge in bacterial infections), (3) absence of allergic triggers (no exposure to fumes/dust/animals, no known allergies, no prior similar episodes), and (4) the daycare exposure as a plausible viral source. The Generated Answer focuses on positive viral evidence but misses the comparative reasoning against allergic/bacterial causes that the question specifically requested.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It successfully addresses symptom type, duration, and progression, but completely omits: (1) the detailed evidence against allergic etiology (no exposures, no allergies, no prior episodes), (2) evidence against bacterial etiology (no fever, no headache, clear vs. colored discharge), (3) the specific quality of discharge (clear), (4) absence of multiple systemic symptoms (cough, sore throat, fever, chills, shortness of breath, post-nasal drip), and (5) the daycare exposure as a potential viral source. The question explicitly asked for evidence distinguishing viral from allergic or bacterial causes, and the Generated Answer provides minimal comparative analysis.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is largely faithful to the transcript with appropriate citations. However, there is one significant issue: the statement '[P-1], [D-39]' claims both citations indicate 'viral illness,' but P-1 only describes symptoms without diagnostic classification—only D-39 contains the doctor's viral diagnosis. Additionally, the reference to 'Knowledge Graph' appears to be a hallucination, as no such external source is mentioned in the instructions or transcript. The phrase 'on and off for the past week' in point 3 is slightly inaccurate—the patient said 'on and off' initially but clarified symptoms were 'pretty constant' [P-8]. These issues reduce faithfulness but don't constitute major fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is moderately relevant to the question. It addresses the viral diagnosis evidence but incompletely addresses the question's core request: distinguishing viral from allergic or bacterial causes. The answer provides positive evidence for viral infection but lacks the comparative analysis explicitly requested. The question asked 'what evidence supported...viral infection RATHER THAN allergic or bacterial cause,' requiring differential diagnosis reasoning. The Generated Answer focuses primarily on viral evidence without adequately contrasting with alternative diagnoses, making it only partially responsive to the question's comparative framework."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies core viral infection evidence (symptom presentation, evolution, duration) but provides an incomplete response to the question's request for differential diagnosis reasoning. It omits critical evidence against allergic causes (no exposures, no allergies, no prior episodes) and bacterial causes (no fever, clear discharge, no systemic symptoms). The answer contains minor faithfulness issues (inaccurate citation claims, reference to non-existent 'Knowledge Graph,' slight mischaracterization of symptom constancy) and lacks the comparative analysis explicitly requested in the question. While factually accurate in what it includes, it covers only about half the key distinguishing features detailed in the Gold Answer."
