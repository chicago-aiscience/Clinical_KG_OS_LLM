  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies several symptoms that match the Gold Answer/transcript: weakness [P-2], generalized achiness [P-20], loss of taste [P-4], subjective fever/hot feeling [P-4], and decreased appetite/reduced intake [P-2, P-4]. However, it contains a clear factual/citation error by stating the patient “explicitly stated, ‘sore throat and cough’ [P-1].” In [P-1] the patient reports shortness of breath and feeling run down/tired, not sore throat/cough; cough and sore throat are discussed later [P-7–P-9]. This misquotation/miscitation undermines accuracy. It also omits other Gold Answer symptoms (e.g., diminished smell, headaches, and denial of congestion), but those are primarily completeness issues rather than direct contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer items covered: weakness, generalized aches, loss of taste, early cough (mentioned but without the ‘dry/on its way/minimal’ nuance), sore throat (mentioned but without the ‘mild/starting’ nuance), subjective fever, and decreased appetite. Key items missed: diminished sense of smell [P-6]; explicit denial of runny nose/congestion [P-10]; and mild headaches with context that they’re not worse than usual/stress-related [P-11–P-13]. Overall this is ~70% coverage of the Gold Answer’s symptom set.",
    "faithfulness": "Most listed symptoms are present in the transcript, but the answer includes an unfaithful claim/quote with incorrect attribution: “sore throat and cough” is not stated in [P-1]. Cough/sore throat are supported elsewhere ([P-7–P-9]), but the specific citation and phrasing are inaccurate. No major additional fabricated symptoms are introduced beyond this misquote/miscitation.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on ‘other symptoms’ beyond shortness of breath and fatigue, and it uses the requested domains (sensory, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional). No significant irrelevant content."
