  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the missed dose of Keppra as the medication-related risk factor and the mother's history of epilepsy as the hereditary risk factor. It also accurately explains the relationship between family history and the diagnosis as a genetic predisposition or increased susceptibility.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most of the key points from the gold answer. However, it omits the specific context regarding why the medication was missed (the daughter's birthday celebration/routine disruption) and the observation that the patient's seizures are typically infrequent, which suggests the medication is usually effective. These details are included in the gold answer's explanation of the risk factors.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the provided transcript. The citations [P-23], [P-9], [P-26], and [P-8] are used accurately to support the claims made.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without including unnecessary information."
