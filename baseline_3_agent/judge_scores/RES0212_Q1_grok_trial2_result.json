  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the cough duration (3 months), recent worsening (3 days), productive nature with 'greenish' 'gross' 'gunk'/sputum, pain on coughing, fatigue/tiredness, sleep disturbance from cough, and denial of blood in sputum, all matching Gold and transcript. However, it has discrepancies: describes cough as 'persistent' without noting Gold's 'initially dry and intermittent/recurrent'; omits no foul smell noticed; inaccurately frames general 'pain' denial (P-19 refers to body pain/tenderness, not cough pain which she admits at P-3); misses subjective fevers (P-4), chest pain only on cough (not at rest), nightly awakenings specifically last month (P-20/21), exercise impairment (P-47), and most denied symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, sick contacts). Main cough facts correct but significant omissions and partial misrepresentation of pain denial qualify as some factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: cough ~3 months (P-2), recent productive change past 3 days (P-2/12), greenish gross gunk/sputum (P-2/9), no blood (P-10), chest discomfort/pain on cough (P-3), fatigue/tired (P-19), cough waking at night/sleep poor (P-19/20). Missed: initially dry/intermittent/recurrent (P-2), onset at pole dancing (P-13), no foul smell (P-11), wakes every night last month (P-21), subjective fevers/hot at night (P-4), impaired exercise (P-47), denied night sweats (P-5), unexplained wt loss/loose clothes (P-6-8), nausea/vomiting (P-17), stiff neck (P-18), other body pain (P-19), sick contacts (P-14/15/32). Covers ~30-40% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: cough 3mo/recent worsening (P-2/D-47), gross/gunk/greenish (P-2/P-9), painful cough (P-3), tiredness/sleep disruption (P-19/D-47), no blood (P-10/D-47), pain denial context (P-19). Doctor's summary (D-47) appropriately referenced. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; sputum phrasing aligns with patient's 'gunk' and doctor's recap.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to directly address the question, categorizing respiratory symptoms (cough characteristics, sputum), associated symptoms (fatigue, sleep), and explicitly denied symptoms (pain, blood), with no off-topic content or tangents."
