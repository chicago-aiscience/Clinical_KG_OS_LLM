  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major factual elements from the Gold Answer. Both identify the diagnosis as 'most likely a viral infection like the common cold,' list the same supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold), mention the COVID swab ordered for 'today' with 48-hour results, and include the isolation guidance. The Generated Answer omits the minor detail about symptoms taking 'a few weeks' to resolve and doesn't explicitly mention 'further instructions from public health' after results return, but these are relatively minor omissions that don't affect core accuracy.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 85-90% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It includes: (1) the working diagnosis, (2) both supportive care recommendations (hydration and OTC medications), (3) the diagnostic test ordered (COVID swab), (4) the timeframe for results (48 hours), and (5) the isolation instruction. Missing elements include: the explicit statement that symptoms can take 'a few weeks' to resolve, the acknowledgment that there's 'not much beyond supportive care,' and the mention of 'further instructions from public health' after results. These are secondary details rather than primary management points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in segment [D-39]. The diagnosis statement, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic testing plan, and public health guidance are all explicitly stated by the doctor. The answer properly cites [D-39] as the source. There are no hallucinated facts or unverifiable claims. The formatting and organization differ from the Gold Answer but all content is grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly focused and directly addresses all components of the question: diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test ordered, and public health guidance. The structured format (using headers for each component) makes the response clear and organized. There is no irrelevant content or tangential information. The answer stays completely on-topic and addresses each specific element requested in the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-structured response that captures all major elements of the doctor's management plan. It correctly identifies the diagnosis, both supportive care recommendations, the diagnostic test, and isolation guidance. The answer is fully faithful to the transcript with proper citation and highly relevant to the question. Minor deductions in correctness and completeness reflect the omission of secondary details (symptom duration expectations and follow-up instructions from public health), but the core management plan is thoroughly and accurately conveyed."
