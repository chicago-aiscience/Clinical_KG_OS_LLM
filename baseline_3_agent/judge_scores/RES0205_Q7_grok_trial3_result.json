  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the onset of flu-like symptoms around two weeks ago, their resolution in 3-4 days, mucus production (whitish clear) for 4-5 days, and transition to dry cough thereafter, matching the Gold Answer. Minor discrepancies include not specifying sore throat/runny nose distinctly, describing cough frequency as 'high' (subjective, as transcript estimates 3-4 times/hour without labeling it high), and omitting that intensity remained the same/not worse and frequency stable/not increased, but core facts are consistent without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: illness onset ~2 weeks ago with flu-like symptoms resolving in 3-4 days [P-14], productive cough with whitish clear mucus days 1-5 [P-6], transition to dry cough persisting [P-5,P-6]. Missed or partially covered: specific mention of sore throat days 1-2-3 resolving [P-13], exact cough intensity 'same' [P-7], frequency stable/not more frequent/at 3-4x/hour/spontaneous [P-8-10], no fevers [P-12], chest soreness only post-coughing [P-15-16], COVID test. Covers ~85% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims are verifiable: flu symptoms/resolution [P-13,14], mucus description/duration [P-6], dry cough transition [P-5,6], persistence [P-2], chest soreness [P-15]. Citations accurate. Minor unverifiable detail: 'frequency remained high' (transcript has low-moderate quantification at 3-4x/hr, no 'high' descriptor, but plausible interpretation of persistence). No hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures a timeline addressing onset of flu-like symptoms, mucus duration/appearance, cough transition, resolution of other symptoms, and cough persistence/frequency/chest effects, perfectly matching the question's requirements with no off-topic content."
