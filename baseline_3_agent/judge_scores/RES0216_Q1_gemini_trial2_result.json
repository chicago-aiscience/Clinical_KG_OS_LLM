  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms reported by the patient (chest tightness, dyspnea, hoarseness, phlegm, and throat clearing). However, it contains a major factual error in the denials section. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain denials for fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, or sweating. In reality, the transcript contains explicit denials for all of these in turns [P-6], [P-12], [P-13], [P-14], and [P-15].",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete regarding the second part of the question. While it lists reported symptoms and two denials (cough and chest pain), it fails to include six other commonly screened symptoms (fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating) that were specifically requested in the prompt and were present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails on faithfulness by making a 'negative hallucination'—claiming that information is missing from the source text when it is explicitly documented. The patient's denials of systemic symptoms (fevers, weight loss, etc.) and autonomic symptoms (sweating, anxiety) are clearly stated in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in its structure and focus, directly attempting to answer both parts of the question. It simply fails to find the relevant data for the second half of the query."
