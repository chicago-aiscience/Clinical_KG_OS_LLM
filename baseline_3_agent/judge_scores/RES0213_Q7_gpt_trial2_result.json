  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer is broadly consistent with the transcript on major events (teenage anxiety history, current attempt to cut down smoking, recent thesis-related stress, chest pain onset ~1.5 weeks ago with pleuritic quality and ~20 min episodes). However, it introduces inaccuracies by implying a continuous/“long-standing” anxiety course and a baseline of symptoms like heart flutter/shortness of breath as anxiety features; the transcript indicates she had anxiety attacks in high school but then largely none for ~8 years, and palpitations/flutter only during prior anxiety attacks, not as an ongoing baseline. It also implies a causal pathway (“stress manifested as chest pain”) more strongly than the transcript supports (patient only suspects stress as a possibility).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: teenage anxiety discussed with family doctor; current academic stress due to Masters thesis and recent time crunch; chest pain started ~1.5 weeks ago and is new; symptoms less noticeable when distracted.\nKey Gold Answer points missed or under-specified: smoking started around age 18; escalation to ~10 cigarettes/day for the last ~2 years; cutting down began a few months ago; explicit ~8-year gap without anxiety care/symptoms; father’s heart attack last year and its role in increasing cardiac fear. Overall, it captures the recent stress→symptom portion well but omits several earlier timeline anchors and the father’s MI context.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the provided transcript, notably repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and claims that it “classifies smoking as a risk factor.” The transcript does not mention any knowledge graph. The remainder is mostly supported by cited transcript lines, but the ungrounded additions and some over-interpretation reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested timeline (smoking, teenage anxiety, recent stress, chest pain onset) and attempts to relate phases. It contains minor tangents (knowledge-graph framing, generic risk-factor commentary) but remains largely on-topic."
