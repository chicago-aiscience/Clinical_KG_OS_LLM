  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns with the Gold Answer on the main elements of the plan: physical exam, sending the tick for species identification, ordering Lyme-related bloodwork, starting prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72h attachment, and giving environmental prevention advice (long grass/wood-field edge; consider insecticide). Minor inaccuracies: it cites [D-5] for lab identification/antibiotics though the plan is stated at [D-6]/[D-18]; it adds “immediately” and frames the exam as to “confirm the risk of Lyme disease,” which is not explicitly stated (the exam is mentioned, but not its purpose). It also characterizes the other physician as “another doctor (or specialist),” whereas the transcript indicates discussing with/being seen by “the doctor/physician” (attending), not necessarily a specialist.",
    "completeness": "Covers all core Gold Answer components: (1) quick physical exam, (2) send tick to local lab for species ID, (3) Lyme titres/serology bloodwork, (4) prophylactic antibiotics with no regimen specified, (5) planned discussion with another physician, and (6) preventive advice about ticks in long grass/wood-field edges and using insecticide. Minor omissions versus Gold Answer/transcript detail: it does not mention the geographic risk rationale (Strathroy/area risk) and does not include the descriptive detail about ticks’ “waving motion with their legs.”",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript. However, there are a few mild ungrounded/overstated elements: calling the consulted physician a possible “specialist,” stating the physical exam is to “confirm” Lyme risk, and the timing emphasis (“immediately”). These are plausible but not explicitly supported. Citations are somewhat inaccurate (e.g., using [D-5] where [D-6]/[D-18] support the claims).",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing diagnostic tests (lab and physical), treatment, planned physician consultation, and preventive outdoor/garden advice, with minimal extraneous content."
