  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the clinician concluded a likely viral URI/common cold and correctly cites the explicit clinician statement [D-39]. It also accurately reflects symptom evolution from initial stuffiness to more rhinorrhea [P-3] and a ~1 week duration [P-1, P-2]. However, it introduces some inaccuracies/overstatements: it leans on a non-provided “Knowledge Graph” to assert that stuffy/runny nose indicate viral illness (not stated in the transcript), and it describes symptoms as “on and off for the past week” without reconciling the patient’s later statement that symptoms were “pretty constant” [P-8]. It also contrasts viral vs allergy/bacterial using general claims (e.g., “rapid-resolution allergic reaction,” “sudden onset of bacterial infection”) that are not supported by the visit content.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key supports include: (1) absence of cough and systemic/lower respiratory symptoms (no cough [P-4], no fever/chills/SOB/sore throat [P-7], no post-nasal drip [P-6]); (2) clear discharge [P-5]; (3) timing/course (1 week, constant, colds can take weeks) [P-1, P-2, P-8, D-39]; (4) progression from stuffy to runny [P-3]; (5) against allergy: no allergen exposures [P-22], no known allergies [P-28], no recurrent similar episodes [P-9]; (6) against bacterial: no fever [P-7], no headache [P-14], no colored discharge [P-5]; (7) possible daycare exposure [P-11]. The Generated Answer covers only (3) partially and (4), and it does not mention clear discharge, the key negative symptoms, the explicit lack of allergy history/exposures, the bacterial “against” features, or the daycare exposure consideration.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “Knowledge Graph,” the assertion that the symptoms specifically “indicate viral illness,” and comparative claims about typical allergy/bacterial timing. The rest (viral conclusion quote [D-39], symptom evolution [P-3], duration [P-1]) is grounded. Because multiple elements are unverifiable from the provided transcript, faithfulness is moderate rather than high.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic (evidence for viral conclusion) and cites some relevant symptom characteristics and the clinician’s impression. However, the question explicitly asks for evidence distinguishing viral from allergic and bacterial causes using symptom characteristics (including absent features and discharge quality) and exposure history. The answer provides limited differentiation and omits most of the allergy/bacterial and exposure-based evidence, so it only partially addresses what was asked."
