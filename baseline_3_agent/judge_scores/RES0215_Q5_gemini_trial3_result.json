  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer regarding the clinical interpretation. It correctly identifies the link between the patient's history (atopy, viral infections) and the triggers (cold weather, carpets, exercise). However, it attributes these relationships to an external 'Knowledge Graph' and specific semantic triples (e.g., '[CAUSES]') that are not present in the gold answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the four main factors requested (allergies, infections, carpets, cold weather). It misses some supporting details mentioned in the gold answer, such as the fact that the viral infections did not require antibiotics and the list of negative environmental factors (smoking, pets, wood stoves) that the physician used to rule out other irritants.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer frequently references a 'Knowledge Graph' and uses specific relationship markers (e.g., [WORSENS], [TAKEN_FOR]) that are not found in the source transcript. This is a hallucination of the source material's format. While the medical conclusions drawn are plausible, the attribution to a non-existent graph within the context is unfaithful to the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing each component of the question and organizing the response logically around the patient's history and current symptoms."
