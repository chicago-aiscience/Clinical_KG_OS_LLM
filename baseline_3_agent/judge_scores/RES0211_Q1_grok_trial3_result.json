  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the core reported symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, feeling crappy overall, pounding headache, feeling hot day and night) which align with the Gold Answer and transcript citations. However, it omits key details like the headache being active during the visit [P-2], feeling 'icky' [P-2], malaise characterization [D-15], and tiredness [P-13]. For denials, it correctly notes sputum/phlegm denial but describes it as implicit with incorrect citation [D-58 instead of P-5/P-6], and erroneously includes irrelevant non-symptom denials (sick contacts, asthma) not matching Gold's list of explicitly denied symptoms (rashes, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, joint aches, breathing issues). These represent significant factual errors and contradictions to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: three-to-four-day duration (header), dry cough & scratchy throat, pounding headache (partial), feeling hot (partial), feeling crappy. Missed: active headache detail, feeling 'icky', malaise, tiredness; all denials except partial sputum (missed rashes/skin changes [P-10], nausea/vomiting [P-11], diarrhea [P-12], joint aches [P-13], breathing difficulty [P-18]). Covers approximately 20-49% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about reported symptoms are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-4], [P-7], [P-9]). Sputum denial verifiable [P-5, P-6], though cited via summary [D-58]; sick contacts and asthma denials verifiable as doctor's accurate recap [D-58] of earlier interview details (e.g., [P-39] for brother, [P-29] no asthma). No hallucinations or fabricated content; minor issues with citation precision and interpretation.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured perfectly to address the question with sections for 'Reported Symptoms' over three-to-four days and 'Explicit Denials', directly matching the query; minor tangents include irrelevant history items (sick contacts, asthma) under denials."
