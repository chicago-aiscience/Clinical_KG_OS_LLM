  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misidentifies the key elements by listing positive symptoms (e.g., fevers, fatigue, muscle aches) confirmed by the patient instead of the explicitly denied symptoms listed in the Gold Answer (e.g., runny nose [D-10/P-10], chest pain [D-16/P-16]). It incorrectly asserts 'no explicit evidence' of denials for chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, directly contradicting the transcript and Gold Answer citations. It introduces unsubstantiated 'Knowledge Graph' references and reframes the diagnosis around positives rather than negatives, leading to complete factual inaccuracy compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 8 specific denied symptoms with citations (runny nose/congestion, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling); explanations of how absences differentiate cardiac, GI, common cold, and neurological causes, leading to respiratory infection/COVID consideration. Generated covers 0% of these, instead listing unrelated positive symptoms and denying the existence of negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims 'no explicit evidence' of denials for listed symptoms, but transcript verifies all Gold-cited denials (e.g., P-10 'No' to runny nose; P-15 'No' to nausea; P-16 'No' to chest pain; P-17 'No' to fast heartbeat). Hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' for COVID indicators not in transcript; misrepresents tentative symptoms (e.g., cough/sore throat as 'confirmed'); fabricates diagnostic certainty on COVID absent from transcript (D-36 says 'can't necessarily rule out covid'). Largely ungrounded with multiple fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Question requires listing explicitly negated symptoms and explaining diagnostic differentiation via their absence. Generated lists positives, denies negatives exist, and differentiates via positives/'Knowledge Graph' (e.g., loss of taste aligning with COVID), missing the core focus on pertinent negatives while adding off-topic symptom lists and external reasoning."
