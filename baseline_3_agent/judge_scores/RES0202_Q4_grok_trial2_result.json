  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition [D-45], correctly states the hypothetical scenario (cough or shortness of breath without fever) for adding it to the differential, and specifies the fever (over 100°F from [P-1]) as the reason for exclusion, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancy: Gold provides more precise fever details (101 or 100.1°F [P-1,P-2]) and additional supporting findings (no wheezing [P-7], SOB uncertainty [P-8]), but no factual errors or contradictions exist.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: condition (asthma), hypothetical presentation (cough/SOB without fever [D-45]), specific excluding finding (fever [P-1]), conclusion (infection, excludes asthma [D-45]). Missed: precise fever temps [P-2], no wheezing [P-7], SOB uncertainty [P-8], nuance that asthma not permanently ruled out but prioritized infection. Covers ~85-90% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: asthma hypothetical and exclusion due to fever in [D-45]; fever reported over 100 in [P-1]. Citations accurate. No hallucinations; 'knowledge graph' mention is extraneous but does not introduce ungrounded info.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers the question on condition (asthma) and excluding finding (fever), with no off-topic content."
