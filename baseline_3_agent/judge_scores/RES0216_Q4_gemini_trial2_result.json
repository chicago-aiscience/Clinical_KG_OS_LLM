  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct. It accurately identifies 'cardiac ischemic' as the condition placed lower on the differential and correctly cites the doctor's reasoning regarding the nature of the chest tightness and the absence of pain, matching the evidence in the transcript and gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary points (cardiac ischemia, tightness vs. exertional dyspnea, and absence of pain). However, it misses several specific pertinent negatives mentioned in the gold answer, such as the absence of anxiety, sweating, and the feeling of impending doom, which were also cited as evidence for deprioritizing the condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully faithful to the source transcript. The citations [D-36], [P-1], and the characterization of the doctor's summary are all grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the question, providing the specific condition and the symptoms used as evidence."
