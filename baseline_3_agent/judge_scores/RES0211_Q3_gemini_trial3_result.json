  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache) and the primary diagnosis (URI/common cold). However, it contains a significant factual error stating that the patient 'does not explicitly list the absence' of GI symptoms or joint pain; in the transcript [P-11, P-12, P-13], the patient explicitly denies these symptoms when asked. Additionally, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the source text.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including the three-to-four-day timeline, the presence of fatigue/malaise as part of the symptom constellation, and the crucial evidence of household viral exposure (the brother's cold). It covers the logic of non-productive cough and the exclusion of systemic symptoms but lacks the full clinical picture provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The response includes a hallucination by referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' to justify symptom mapping, which is not part of the provided transcript or clinical context. It also mischaracterizes the patient's interaction regarding the denial of symptoms, claiming they weren't explicitly listed when they were directly denied in the Q&A section of the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing how specific symptoms and the absence of others support the URI diagnosis. It follows the structure of the question well, even if some supporting details are inaccurate or missing."
