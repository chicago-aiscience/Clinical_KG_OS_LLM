{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists key symptoms (sore throat, worsening dyspnea, reduced taste without smell loss, fatigue/muscle aches) supporting COVID suspicion per [D-43]; Generated Answer incorrectly attributes smell loss (anosmia) to patient ([P-19] explicitly states 'not smell'), omits dyspnea and fatigue/aches, focuses narrowly on sore throat/dysphagia, and fabricates 'Knowledge Graph' link; significant contradictions on sensory symptoms central to question.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: sore throat [P-2,P-4], dyspnea [P-8-10], reduced taste (no smell loss) [P-19-21], fatigue/aches [P-25-26], doctor's [D-43] statement, screening [D-19], exposure context [P-12-14]; Generated covers sore throat partially and taste/smell (but inaccurately), doctor's quote; misses dyspnea, fatigue/aches, exposure details (~25% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates patient-reported smell loss ([P-19] says 'not smell'), 'Knowledge Graph' not in transcript, misattributes doctor's reasoning to smell loss; verifiable elements: sore throat [P-2], doctor's [D-43], taste query [P-19]; multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom combination for COVID suspicion and taste/smell role, but distorts facts; minor tangents like Knowledge Graph, still focused on question."

  "summary": "Generated Answer has significant factual errors, especially fabricating smell loss contrary to transcript and Gold, while omitting key symptoms like dyspnea, resulting in low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness despite decent relevance."
