  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the primary diagnosis of acute bronchitis, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it lacks the depth of the Gold Answer, which specifies a transition from a chronic cough to an acute infection and mentions the possibility of early community-acquired pneumonia.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the three clinical features requested but fails to capture the nuanced 'how' provided in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it misses the explanation of sputum color distinguishing infection from clear drainage, and the productive nature signifying a shift from irritation to inflammation. It also neglects the patient's three-month history of intermittent coughing.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a major hallucination by repeatedly referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' to establish medical relationships. No such Knowledge Graph was provided in the source transcript or the prompt context. The citations to the transcript (P-2, P-4, D-47) are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the diagnosis and the three clinical features specified in the question without unrelated tangents."
