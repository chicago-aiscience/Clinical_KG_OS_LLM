  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as a “cardiac ischemic” picture and accurately reflects the clinician’s stated rationale: symptoms described as chest tightness rather than pain and the clinician’s comment about not really getting out of breath with exercise. It does not introduce contradictions with the Gold Answer; it is mainly missing additional supporting symptom negatives rather than asserting wrong facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: (1) cardiac ischemic picture placed lower on the differential; (2) chest symptoms characterized more as tightness than pain; (3) clinician noted not really getting out of breath with exercise; (4) absence of pain. Key points missed: the explicit pertinent negatives the clinician screened for and the patient denied—anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom—which the Gold Answer includes as part of the symptom-absence evidence for lowering ischemia. Also does not explicitly reference the patient’s denial of chest pain at P-5 (though it captures “no pain” in general). Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript: D-36 supports lowering cardiac ischemia due to no pain and not really getting out of breath with exercise; P-1 supports chest tightness worsened with walks and “not really pain.” No clear hallucinated symptoms or conditions are added.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what condition was lowered on the differential and which symptom findings/absences were cited. It stays focused on the question with no meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded identification of cardiac ischemia being deprioritized, but incomplete because it omits key denied associated symptoms (anxiety/sweating/impending doom) cited in the Gold Answer."
