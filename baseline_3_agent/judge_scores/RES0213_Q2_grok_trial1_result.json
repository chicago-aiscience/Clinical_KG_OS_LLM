  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC medications for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and their ineffectiveness, matching Gold Answer and transcript [P-6]. However, it incorrectly states there is 'no indication' of routine OTC supplements, directly contradicting Gold Answer and transcript [P-25] where patient reports taking a daily multivitamin as the only regular item. Gold also notes no prescription meds (implied correctly) and additional non-med details like stress management and smoking, which Generated omits but are not core contradictions. This is a significant factual error on routine supplements.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer for pain [P-6]; 2) All ineffective [P-6]; 3) Daily multivitamin routine [P-25]; 4) No prescription meds [P-25]; 5) Stress management (reading, running) [P-28]; 6) Trying to quit smoking [P-13/14/18]. Generated covers 1 & 2 fully (pain meds & effectiveness), misses 3-6 entirely. Covers ~30-40% of key points, but core question points (pain meds/supps & effect) partially missed due to routine supp omission.",
    "faithfulness": "Pain meds and quote 'hasn't really helped very much' fully verifiable [P-6]. Effectiveness claim accurate. Routine supplements claim 'no indication' not grounded and false, as multivitamin explicitly stated [P-25] ('I take like a multi vitamin but that's it'). Additional hallucination: references non-existent 'knowledge graph provided'. Multiple unverifiable/false claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly lists pain meds, effectiveness, and addresses routine supplements (albeit incorrectly), with clear structure matching question on OTC meds/supplements for pain/routine and effectiveness. No off-topic content; perfectly focused."
