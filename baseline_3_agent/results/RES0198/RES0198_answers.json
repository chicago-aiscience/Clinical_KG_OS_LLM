    "answer": "Based on the provided clinical information and transcript segments, here is the documentation regarding the patient's nasal symptoms, discharge characteristics, and denied symptoms:\n\n**1. Reported Symptoms**\nThe patient reported having a **stuffy nose** and a **runny nose**. The patient states in the first turn that they have had a \"stuffy nose... as well as a runny nose for the past week\" [P-1]. The patient further describes the progression in a later turn, noting that the nose felt \"pretty stuffy at first, but now it's mostly running\" [P-3]. The Doctor summarizes the presentation as \"stuffy nose in the runny nose\" [D-39], noting these are symptoms indicative of a **viral illness** like the common cold [D-39].\n\n**2. Character of Nasal Discharge**\nThe provided clinical information does not specify the character of the nasal discharge (e.g., clear, yellow, thick, or bloody). While the patient notes that the nose is \"running\" [P-3], no adjectives describing the fluid's appearance or consistency are mentioned.\n\n**3. Denied Symptoms**\nThe provided transcript segments do not explicitly list the denial of specific related symptoms such as sore throat, cough, post-nasal drip, or loss of taste/smell. While the patient provides affirmative denials (e.g., \"No\" [P-4] and \"Nope, nothing like that\" [P-14] and \"Um. No, um not that I've noticed\" [P-16]), the context of what specific symptoms were being queried in those turns is missing from the provided text.
