No, no, nothing like that.\n[P-11] Patient: Oh yes, I have had that for the past couple of days as well.\n[P-12] Patient: It's pretty clear.\n[P-13] Patient: Yeah, um. He has had uh like he's had fevers in the past, but I I didn't really check this time. He didn't seem hot. He didn't have any chills.\n[P-28] Patient: Um uh his grandparents had um asthma, but he's been worked up for that and he doesn't get short of breath or wheezing or anything like that with even with physical activity. So yeah, so he doesn't have that.\n\nQuestion: How did this patient's symptoms develop over time from initial onset to the day of the visit, including the relative timing and duration of the dry cough versus the runny nose, any changes in severity of the cough, and how the current episode compared to the patient's prior experiences with similar symptoms?\n\nAnswer:",
