  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It states the doctor did not systematically explore infection exposure sources, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor asked about: living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48], coworker illness [D-50], and travel [D-49]. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the transcript evidence.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not mention: the apartment living situation, workplace at car dealership, lunch room contact, denial of sick coworkers, denial of travel, or substance use screening. It covers 0% of the specific details provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript. It claims 'there is no evidence in the provided text that the doctor actively questioned the patient' about these topics, when exchanges [D-45] through [D-50] explicitly document these questions. This represents hallucination through omission and misrepresentation of what is clearly present in the source material.",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer addresses whether exposure sources were explored (relevant to the question), it provides an incorrect conclusion. The question asks what sources were explored, expecting enumeration of the specific areas investigated. The Generated Answer instead argues none were explored, which is both wrong and fails to provide the requested information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect and contradicts both the transcript and Gold Answer. It falsely claims the doctor did not systematically explore infection exposure sources, when the transcript clearly documents questions about living situation [D-45/P-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47/P-47], workplace [D-48/P-48], coworker illness [D-50/P-50], and travel [D-49/P-49]. The answer covers none of the specific details from the Gold Answer and misrepresents what is explicitly present in the source material, constituting a significant failure in correctness, completeness, and faithfulness."
