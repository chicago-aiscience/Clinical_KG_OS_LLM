  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all asked elements: it identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, specifies that a swab test was ordered, gives the expected turnaround time of 24–48 hours, and states that if negative the alternative considered was another viral illness going around seasonally. No contradictions or factual errors relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "For the components actually asked in the question, the Generated Answer includes all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) swab test, (3) 24–48 hour turnaround, and (4) alternative diagnosis of another viral illness. The Gold Answer contains additional contextual counseling (isolation, public health contact tracing, supportive care), but these are not required by the question prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically D-52. No hallucinated details were added (it does not invent the type of swab beyond what is said, and it does not add counseling points not mentioned).",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on what the question asks (condition to rule out, test and turnaround time, alternative diagnosis if negative) and does not include irrelevant clinical detail."
