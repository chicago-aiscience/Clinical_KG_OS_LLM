  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states the clinician’s plan included (1) likely doing a COVID swab, (2) possibly changing the asthma medication regimen to improve control, and (3) the trainee going to speak with the supervising doctor and returning to the patient. The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript “does not include” these plan elements and therefore says the question cannot be answered. This directly contradicts the transcript (D-29: “probably will do a covid swab…”, D-43: “maybe all you need is a little change to your medications…”, D-29/D-43: “before I go talk to the doctor” / “I’m gonna go talk to the doctor…”).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed:\n- COVID-19 diagnostic test: COVID swab (missed; explicitly denied it was present).\n- Medication-regimen suggestion: a change to medications to better control asthma and reduce need with sports (missed).\n- Next steps with supervising physician: go talk to the doctor, present the case, return shortly (missed).\nThe answer instead summarizes symptoms/triggers/family history, which are not what was asked.",
    "faithfulness": "While the symptom/trigger history it summarizes is largely supported by the transcript, the central claim that the plan is not present in the provided context is not grounded and is contradicted by multiple cited transcript lines (D-29, D-43). It also introduces extraneous framing (“knowledge graph”) and an explicit diagnostic mapping that is not the focus of the plan question (even though asthma history is mentioned).",
    "relevance": "The question asks for the clinician’s overall plan (COVID swab, medication change suggestion, and consulting the supervising physician). The Generated Answer does not provide this plan and instead focuses on history and symptoms; thus it only minimally addresses the task."
