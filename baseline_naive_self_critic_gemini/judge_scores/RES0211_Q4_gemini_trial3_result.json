  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the contents of the transcript. It explicitly states that the doctor did not screen for eczema, allergic reactions/EpiPen use, or night sweats, when in fact the doctor asks about night sweats in [D-9], an EpiPen in [D-21], and eczema in [D-32]. It also claims Jessica did not explicitly answer the asthma question, when she answered 'No' in [P-29].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the vast majority of conditions screened for that are listed in the Gold Answer, including productive cough, family history of asthma, eczema, rashes, GI symptoms, and joint pain. It only identifies asthma and exposure to illness, which accounts for less than 20% of the relevant diagnostic screening documented in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails significantly on faithfulness by hallucinating that information is missing from the text segments when it is clearly present. Additionally, it refers to a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context of this evaluation.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to follow the requested structure, it fails to provide the specific information requested about the examples provided in the prompt (asthma, eczema, EpiPen, night sweats), incorrectly claiming they were not discussed. This makes the answer largely unhelpful for the specific query asked by the user or the doctor's screening process shown in the text and Gold Answer. "
