  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition to rule out (COVID-19) and the ordered test (a COVID swab), matching [D-43]. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript contains no information about recent social contacts/exposure. In fact, the patient explicitly reports meeting friends to walk dogs and that one friend was sick, with occasional close proximity despite being outdoors [P-20], and the doctor asks whether that friend had a COVID test [D-21]. This error undermines the third required element of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) order COVID swab, (3) exposure prompt = sick friend during dog walks with sometimes-close contact outdoors/uncertainty about friend’s COVID test. The Generated Answer includes (1) and (2) but omits (and contradicts) (3). It does not mention the exposure details that prompted the consideration.",
    "faithfulness": "While the first two statements are grounded in [D-43], the claim that there is no contact/exposure information is directly contradicted by [P-20] and [D-21]. This is an ungrounded/incorrect assertion relative to the transcript (i.e., not faithful). No other major fabricated details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to answer exactly the three parts of the question (condition, test, prompting social-contact detail). Although the third part is answered incorrectly, the content remains on-topic without major tangents."
