  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims that the consultation ends abruptly and that no next steps were communicated. However, the provided transcript clearly contains turns D-27 through D-38, where the doctor explicitly states they will consult with another physician and return to discuss potential tests and the path forward.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the involvement of the supervising doctor, the plan to return shortly, the mention of potential tests, or the patient's agreement.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the provided source transcript. It hallucinates that the text ends at turn P-26 and claims that turn IDs like D-27 or D-30 are missing, even though they are clearly present in the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question because it erroneously concludes the information is missing from the text. It does not provide any of the requested details regarding next steps or decision-making involvement."
