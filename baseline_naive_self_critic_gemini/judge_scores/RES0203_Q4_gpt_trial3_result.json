  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies a few negative findings (no fever [P-10], no headaches [P-12], no allergies [P-26]). However, it contains clear factual errors relative to the transcript/Gold Answer: (1) it states dyspnea and sore throat were “not identified” in the transcript, but both were explicitly asked and denied (no difficulty breathing [D-11, P-11]; no sore throat [D-13, P-13]); (2) it misuses citations—\"Uh no\" at [P-15] refers to no muscle aches/weakness, not fever; (3) it implies [P-27] is an elaboration of allergies, but [P-27] is denial of family history. Its clinical interpretation also overreaches (e.g., claims about ruling out intracranial pressure), and the fever interpretation is somewhat misleading given afebrile COVID/viral illness is common. Overall, significant inaccuracies are present despite a few correct items.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer negatives include: no fever; no difficulty breathing; no headaches; no sore throat; no chills/night sweats; no muscle aches/weakness; no chest pain; no sputum or blood; no cough triggers (cold/environmental); plus denials of chronic conditions, meds, surgeries/hospitalizations, allergies, and family history. The Generated Answer only covers fever, headaches, and allergies, omitting the majority of key review-of-systems negatives and most other pertinent negatives. This is well under 20% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: the claim that dyspnea and sore throat were not present in the transcript is directly contradicted by [D-11/P-11] and [D-13/P-13]; citations are incorrectly attributed (fever linked to [P-15]; allergies linked to [P-27]). While some interpretation is permissible, these constitute multiple transcript-inconsistent assertions.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at listing negative findings and discussing clinical implications, which is on-topic. However, it includes tangential discussion (e.g., intracranial pressure) and fails to address the requested comprehensive list of negative ROS findings; it also incorrectly dismisses dyspnea/sore throat as absent from the transcript. Thus it is only partially responsive."
