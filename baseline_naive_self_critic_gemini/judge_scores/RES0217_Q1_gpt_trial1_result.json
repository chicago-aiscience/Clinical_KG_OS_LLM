  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies local redness/tenderness/soreness and correctly notes that the patient denied fever and headaches. However, it contains a major factual error about systemic screening for joint pain: the transcript shows the doctor asked about joint pain [D-7] and the patient denied it (“No.”) [P-7]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states the patient ‘reported’ joint pain and conflates local skin soreness behind the knee with joint pain. This contradicts both the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Local symptoms: partially covered (redness, tenderness, soreness) but misses several Gold Answer specifics: (1) exact location/crease behind the knee and that it was ‘stuck pretty good,’ (2) that soreness was of the skin/surrounding area ‘not the joint itself,’ (3) explicit denial of bullseye/target rash and ‘larger circle rash,’ and (4) ‘totally fine’ otherwise. Systemic symptoms: includes fever and headaches denial, but fails to correctly include joint pain denial (instead reverses it). Overall, it captures some but not most key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The statement that the patient ‘reported’ joint pain is not supported by the transcript and directly contradicts it (she denied joint pain [P-7]). Aside from that, the remainder is mostly grounded (red/tender/sore at the site; denial of fever and headaches). Because a key claim is contradicted by the source, faithfulness is substantially reduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on the asked elements (local symptoms at bite site and systemic symptoms screened for—fever, joint pain, headaches). There are no major tangents, but the incorrect handling of joint pain reduces its utility while still remaining on-topic."

  "summary": "The response is on-topic and correctly captures local soreness/redness and denial of fever/headache, but it makes a major error by reversing the joint-pain screen (patient denied joint pain), and it omits several key local details noted in the Gold Answer."
