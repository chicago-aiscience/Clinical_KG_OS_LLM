  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient missed their Keppra dose and had a seizure, and accurately cites P-9 where the patient recognizes the causal link. However, it introduces elements not present in the transcript (the 'Knowledge Graph' reference and formal risk factor notation) and misses key contextual details from P-24 about the daughter's birthday and disrupted dinner routine that explains WHY the dose was missed. The core facts are accurate but presentation differs from Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points: missed dose of Keppra, occurrence of seizure, and patient's recognition in P-9. However, it omits several important details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the timing (seizure occurred the same night as missed dose), (2) the specific explanation in P-24 about the daughter's birthday disrupting routine, (3) patient's comment about 'usually don't get seizures very often' suggesting this was unusual, (4) that recognition was voluntary not prompted directly about medication, and (5) the one-time situational nature of the lapse. Covers approximately 60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citation of P-9 and P-23. However, it introduces 'Knowledge Graph' terminology and formal notation ('[RISK_FACTOR] forgot medication --[PRECIPITATES]--> [SYMPTOM] seizure') that does not appear in the source material. This appears to be a system artifact rather than hallucination, but it's not verifiable in the transcript. The core clinical claims are all supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: how the missed dose connects to the seizure and what evidence shows the patient recognized this link. It stays focused on these two points without significant tangents. The Knowledge Graph reference, while not from the transcript, is an attempt to explain the connection rather than irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core causal relationship between the missed Keppra dose and the seizure, and accurately cites the patient's self-recognition in P-9. However, it lacks important contextual details from P-24 about the disrupted routine due to the daughter's birthday, and the patient's observation that seizures are usually infrequent. The introduction of 'Knowledge Graph' terminology appears to be a system artifact but reduces faithfulness since it's not verifiable in the transcript. The answer is highly relevant and factually accurate on main points but could be more complete."
