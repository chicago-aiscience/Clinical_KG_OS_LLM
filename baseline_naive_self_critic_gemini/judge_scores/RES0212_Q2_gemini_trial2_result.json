  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the patient never mentioned previously prescribed medications. However, in [P-23], the patient states her family doctor gave her a recommendation/prescription for a cream at Shoppers Drug Mart when her eczema was bad. Additionally, it states she is not taking any treatments, ignoring her current use of moisturizing cream for eczema [P-23].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete. It fails to mention: 1) The current use of moisturizing cream for eczema; 2) The previous prescription for eczema; 3) The status of contraception (condoms vs hormonal); 4) The status of allergy medications; and 5) The absence of OTC cough remedies.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a negative, claiming the patient did not mention previous medications when she clearly did in [P-23]. It correctly identifies recreational substance use from the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant as it directly addresses the question of medications and treatments, though the information provided is inaccurate and incomplete."
