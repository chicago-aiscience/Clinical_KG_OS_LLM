  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the chronological sequence (stuffy nose first, then fever and sore throat, followed by muscle ache) and accurately notes the temporal relationship with her husband's symptoms (he had symptoms for a week vs. her three-day fever). However, it lacks the precise detail from the Gold Answer about the stuffy nose occurring 'just before' the fever and the muscle aches appearing '2-3 days' ago, making it coincident with the fever. The Generated Answer is factually accurate but less precise about timing.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main progression elements: stuffy nose as first symptom, fever development (3 days), sore throat (ongoing), muscle ache, and husband's week-long illness. However, it misses several key details from the Gold Answer: (1) the explicit confirmation sequence between doctor and patient about stuffy nose being first [D-2, P-2, D-3, P-3], (2) the specific timing that muscle aches appeared 'over the past two to three days' and coincided with fever [D-15, P-15, P-16], (3) the calculation that husband's illness began ~4 days before patient's fever, (4) the clinical interpretation about household transmission pattern, and (5) the sore throat being described as 'not going away'. Covers approximately 60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The stuffy nose appearing first is confirmed in P-1, the three-day fever in P-1, sore throat still present in P-1, muscle ache in P-13, and husband's week-long symptoms in P-19. The answer appropriately cites transcript segments. No hallucinated content is present, though it's less detailed than possible from the available transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's three components: (1) symptom progression from onset to presentation, (2) which symptom appeared first, and (3) timeline comparison with husband's symptoms. All content is focused on answering these specific elements without tangential information. The answer is well-structured and stays on topic throughout."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate chronological progression of symptoms (stuffy nose → fever/sore throat → muscle ache) and correctly compares timelines with the husband's illness. It demonstrates strong faithfulness to the transcript with appropriate citations and maintains excellent relevance to the question. However, it lacks the precision and depth of the Gold Answer, missing specific temporal details (muscle aches coinciding with fever, husband's symptoms starting ~4 days earlier), confirmation sequences between doctor and patient, and clinical interpretation about household transmission patterns. The answer covers core facts correctly but omits approximately 40% of the detailed information present in the Gold Answer."
