  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly states there are no explicit concluding remarks or stated plan, missing [D-33] where the doctor explicitly says 'I think I've got all the information I need and I'll pass it on to the doctor who'll take a look at you,' directly contradicting Gold Answer's accurate quote and description of the triage plan; on key info, it covers some symptoms (sharp pain with deep breaths, anxiety-related breathing), anxiety history, smoking, family history, and stress but introduces errors like 'nausea-like symptoms' (not in transcript) and omits many details like episode duration, rest trigger, distraction relief, and most pertinent negatives (no trauma, fevers, asthma); significant factual errors on plan and partial inaccuracies elsewhere.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) symptom details (duration 1.5wks, 20min episodes at rest/alone, deep breath worse/not exercise, distraction relief) - partially covered (deep breath, some triggers); (2) failed OTC - partially (Tylenol); (3) pertinent negatives (trauma, fevers, asthma, dyspnea, palpitations, family sudden death) - mostly missed; (4) relevant history (anxiety teen, smoking details, dad MI) - well covered; (5) psychosocial (thesis stress, alone, multivitamin) - partially (stress/thesis); plan completely missed; covers ~30-40% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly grounded with transcript citations (e.g., [D-19], [P-3], [P-19]); however, hallucinates Knowledge Graph (KG) relationships not in transcript (e.g., '[RISK_FACTOR] stress --[CONTRIBUTES_TO]--> [SYMPTOM] chest pain'), 'nausea-like symptoms' (Alka-Seltzer tried but no nausea reported), and misstates dialogue end (claims ends at anxiety inquiry, ignores [D-33]); multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses key clinical information gathered with structured points tied to symptoms, history, and stress/anxiety; partially addresses plan by denying it exists (though inaccurately); minor tangents via KG references but overall focused on question's second part with summary on clinical picture informing next steps."
