  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the plan described in the transcript and Gold Answer: quick physical exam, sending the tick for species identification, Lyme serology/bloodwork, prophylactic antibiotics, and discussion with/hand-off to another physician. It correctly avoids inventing a specific antibiotic. Minor issue: it does not explicitly state the key rationale details (\"over 72 hours\" and Strathroy risk) as clearly as the Gold Answer, but it does not contradict them.",
    "completeness": "It includes the three diagnostic components (physical exam, tick ID, bloodwork), treatment (prophylactic antibiotics), planned physician consultation, and preventive garden/outdoor advice (ticks in long grass/wood-field edge, consider insecticide). The main missing element versus the Gold Answer is the specific preventive detail that ticks can be spotted making a \"waving motion with their legs.\" It also does not explicitly restate the >72-hour attachment and Strathroy risk factors, though it alludes to timeframe/risk assessment.",
    "faithfulness": "All elements stated are supported by the transcript: physical exam and talk to doctor after exam (D-18/D-22), tick sent to lab (D-6, D-18), bloodwork for titres/serology (D-18), prophylactic antibiotics (D-6, D-13, D-18), and preventive advice about long grass/wood-field edge and insecticide (D-18). No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The answer is tightly focused on the requested clinical plan components (diagnostics, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice) and contains no meaningful tangents."
