  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies two major features used in the doctor’s reasoning: a dry/worsening cough and a measured fever just over 100°F, and it correctly captures the clinician’s explicit logic in [D-45] that fever makes an infectious process more likely than asthma. However, it contains a clear factual error by stating that a change in taste is not documented; the parent explicitly reports possible loss of taste in [P-17]. It also leans on the clinician’s initial (incorrect) “five days” statement [D-3] without acknowledging the parent’s correction to ~3 days [P-4]. Overall, the core inference (infection/COVID workup due to cough+fever) is right but with important inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) dry cough worsening over ~3 days; (2) fever >100°F (~100.1–101°F); (3) possible loss of taste; (4) doctor explicitly aligned symptoms with COVID and ordered testing/isolation [D-44]; (5) fever used to favor infection over asthma [D-45], with mention of systemic features (fatigue/decreased appetite).\n\nGenerated Answer covers: (1) cough (partially, though duration framing is muddled), (2) fever with approximate values, (4) COVID swab and infectious-vs-asthma reasoning. It misses (3) the taste-change element entirely (and incorrectly denies it) and does not incorporate the broader systemic features emphasized in the Gold Answer. Net coverage is roughly around half to two-thirds of the Gold Answer’s key content.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not fully grounded in the transcript because it directly contradicts it by claiming taste change is not documented, despite [P-17]. Other elements (cough, fever estimate, COVID swab/isolation, infectious-vs-asthma logic) are supported by the transcript, but this contradiction is substantial and reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the symptom combination and the clinician’s reasoning toward COVID/infection versus asthma, which directly addresses the question. The main relevance gap is the omission of the taste-change symptom that the question explicitly asks to include, but it does not go off-topic."
