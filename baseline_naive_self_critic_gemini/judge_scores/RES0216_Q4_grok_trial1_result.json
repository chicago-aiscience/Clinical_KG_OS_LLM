  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as 'cardiac ischemia,' equivalent to the Gold's 'cardiac ischemic picture' [D-36]. It accurately cites the doctor's statements on lack of significant shortness of breath with exercise [D-36] and absence of chest pain [D-36, corroborated by P-1 and P-5]. All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript without errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: condition ('cardiac ischemic picture'), nature of complaints (tightness vs. pain, lack of exertional dyspnea/out of breath with exercise). Missed: explicit emphasis on tightness as primary descriptor, patient's some difficulty with full breath [P-7] but downplayed, absence of anxiety/sweating/impending doom [P-6], clinician screening [D-5,D-6], and patient relief [P-35]. Covers approximately 60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript: condition and doctor's citations from [D-36]; patient confirmation of no pain from [P-1]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by naming the condition and listing specific doctor-cited symptom findings (nature: SOB/tightness; absence: pain), with no off-topic content."
