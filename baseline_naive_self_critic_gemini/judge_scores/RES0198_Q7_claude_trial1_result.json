  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. The patient explicitly stated that the nose 'felt pretty stuffy at first, but now it's mostly running' [P-3], clearly indicating stuffiness started first and the predominant symptom changed to running over the week. The Generated Answer incorrectly claims 'no specific evidence' for which symptom appeared first and 'no change in which symptom was predominant.' Additionally, the Generated Answer incorrectly characterizes symptoms as 'intermittent' based only on [P-1], ignoring the patient's clarification in [P-8] that symptoms were 'pretty constant for the past week' when directly asked by the doctor.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses or misrepresents most key points from the Gold Answer: (1) fails to identify stuffiness as the initial symptom, (2) fails to describe the shift from congestion to rhinorrhea as the predominant symptom, (3) incorrectly states symptoms were intermittent rather than acknowledging the clarification to 'pretty constant,' and (4) omits the influence of decongestants on symptom progression. It only correctly identifies the one-week duration.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is partially unfaithful to the transcript. While it correctly cites [P-1] for the 'on and off' description, it fails to incorporate the critical clarification in [P-8] where the patient states symptoms were 'pretty constant.' More importantly, it contradicts [P-3] by claiming no evidence exists for which symptom appeared first and no change in predominant symptom, when the patient explicitly states 'It felt pretty stuffy at first, but now it's mostly running.'",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the three components of the question (onset, symptom progression, constant vs intermittent), making it relevant to the query. However, the responses to each component contain factual errors that undermine the quality of the answer."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's structure but contains multiple significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims no evidence exists for which symptom appeared first, despite the patient explicitly stating stuffiness came first [P-3]. It fails to recognize the documented shift from congestion to rhinorrhea as the predominant symptom. Most critically, it characterizes symptoms as intermittent based solely on [P-1], ignoring the patient's direct clarification in [P-8] that symptoms were 'pretty constant for the past week.' The answer demonstrates poor integration of the complete transcript and misses the nuanced progression described in the Gold Answer."
