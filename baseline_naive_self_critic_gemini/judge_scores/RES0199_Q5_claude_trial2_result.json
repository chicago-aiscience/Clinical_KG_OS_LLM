  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor did systematically explore exposure sources: living situation [D-45/P-45], environmental triggers [D-46/P-46], sick contacts [D-47/P-47], workplace [D-48/P-48], travel [D-49/P-49], and whether coworkers were sick [D-50/P-50]. The Generated Answer falsely claims 'there is no evidence' of this systematic inquiry when the evidence is explicitly present in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) apartment living alone, (2) environmental trigger screening, (3) work at car dealership, (4) lunch room as potential exposure site, (5) no sick coworkers noted, (6) no recent travel, (7) substance use screening. Instead, it incorrectly asserts the doctor did not explore these areas.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript evidence. It claims the doctor 'did not systematically explore' exposure sources when exchanges [D-45] through [D-50] explicitly document this exploration. The statement 'there is no evidence in the provided text' is demonstrably false, as these exchanges are clearly present in the source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question about what exposure sources the doctor explored, but provides the opposite of the correct answer. While it focuses on the relevant topic, it fundamentally misrepresents the content of the consultation."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect and contradicts clear evidence in the transcript. It falsely claims the doctor did not systematically explore infection exposure sources when the transcript explicitly shows inquiries about living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48], travel [D-49], and ill coworkers [D-50]. This represents a complete failure to identify and report the documented systematic inquiry into potential exposure sources."
