  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links eczema to atopy and risk of asthma/reactive airways explaining 3-month cough; cat allergy supports atopy and hyperresponsiveness (no documented exposure); vaping as irritant impairing defenses; combo lowers threshold for chronic inflammation to acute sputum. Generated similarly connects eczema to atopy priming airways, cat allergy as IgE trigger, vaping as chronic irritant with inflammation/ciliary damage, and collective lowered threshold for chronic symptoms. Minor discrepancies: Generated calls vaping 'regularly' (transcript: once every 2 weeks), assumes cat exposure (Gold notes none documented), adds unmentioned chemicals (propylene glycol etc.), mentions 'knowledge graph' not present. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: eczema [P-22] as atopic marker/risk for asthma/3-mo cough; cat allergy [P-27] supports atopy/hyperresp, no exposure [P-13-15]; vaping [P-36/37] irritants/exacerbate; combo atopic+irritant->chronic inflamn->acute greenish sputum [P-9]; no formal testing. Generated covers eczema atopy, cat allergy trigger, vaping irritant, collective lowered threshold/chronic symptoms with added symptom cites [P-2/3/19/47]. Misses: specific 3-mo preceding cough, caution on no cat exposure, direct acute infection link, no testing note. Covers 80-99% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites accurate: cat [P-27], vaping [P-36], symptoms [P-2/3/19/47]. Verifiable: eczema atopy plausible from [P-22]; vaping irritant from [P-36/37]; symptoms match. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph'; specific vaping chemicals (PG/VG/nicotine/residuals - transcript only marijuana vape, no details); assumes 'intermittent cat exposure' (none documented); IgE details plausible but elaborated. Mostly grounded with minor unverifiable plausible additions.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around the three factors (eczema, cat allergy, vaping) and their collective contribution to chronic/recurrent respiratory symptoms as asked, with detailed breakdown and symptom ties; no off-topic content."
