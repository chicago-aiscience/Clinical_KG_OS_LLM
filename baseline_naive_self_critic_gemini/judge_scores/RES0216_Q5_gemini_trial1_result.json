  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the contents of the transcript. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain details about skipping doses or failing to refill the rescue inhaler, whereas the transcript contains this information in P-17, P-18, P-19, and D-34. It also incorrectly asserts that walking is not exercise in the context of cardiac differential. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these medication changes as central to the clinical picture.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover the key points of the Gold Answer. It misses the explanation of how reduced maintenance dosing compromised control and how the lack of a rescue inhaler left the patient without a fast-acting bronchodilator for exertion-induced symptoms. It focuses only on the general diagnosis of asthma rather than the specific relationship requested by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant hallucination by claiming a 'Knowledge Graph' was used and by falsely claiming the absence of specific text in the transcript. All medication-related facts are clearly present in the provided source text, and the generated answer's denial of their existence is a major failure of faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is only partially relevant. While it identifies asthma as the underlying issue, it fails to address the specific components of the question (skipping doses and refill failure) by erroneously claiming that information is unavailable. It bypasses the 'how' part of the query entirely."
