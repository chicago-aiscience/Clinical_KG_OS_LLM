    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all requested elements: the alternative diagnosis to exclude was COVID-19, the test ordered was a COVID swab, and the expected turnaround time was 24–48 hours. No contradictions or factual errors are present.",
    "completeness": "It includes all key points required to answer the question (alternative diagnosis, specific test, and turnaround time). It does not add extra details about symptom overlap, but that is not necessary to satisfy the question and the Gold Answer also notes the doctor did not specify which symptoms overlapped.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript, specifically [D-52]. No hallucinated or unverifiable statements were added.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question and contains no irrelevant information."
