  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cough onset as ~3 months ago and sleep disruption beginning ~1 month ago. It also notes that the cough became productive with greenish sputum in the “past few days,” which is directionally consistent but less precise than the transcript/gold timeline (~3 days). The major factual error is stating the patient did not confirm subjective fevers; in the transcript she explicitly reports feeling “hot at night in the past couple days” (subjective fever) and did not take her temperature. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer and source.",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer: (1) onset ~3 months ago during pole dancing class; (2) ~2 months of dry/intermittent cough; (3) nocturnal awakenings nightly for ~last month; (4) productive greenish sputum starting ~3 days prior; (5) subjective fevers “past couple days.” The Generated Answer covers (1) and (3) and partially covers (4) (missing the specific ~3-day timing). It omits (2) (dry/intermittent course) and misses (5) entirely (and instead negates it).",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are grounded (3-month onset; ~1 month sleep disruption; greenish sputum). However, it incorrectly claims no explicit subjective fevers despite clear transcript evidence of feeling hot at night in the past couple days. It also uses an inaccurate citation ([D-13]) to support the 3-month duration (that detail is from the patient at [P-2] and clarified around [P-13]). These issues reduce grounding/faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested cough timeline milestones (onset, sleep disruption, productivity, fevers). The brief mention of night sweats is minor and still related to the fever question."
