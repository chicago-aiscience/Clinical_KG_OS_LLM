  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims there is no information in the transcript about screening for infectious causes (including COVID-19), planned tests, or related symptoms/exposures, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and explicit transcript sections (D-21 to D-29) that detail questions on colds/infections, sick contacts, travel, loss of taste/smell, fevers, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, all denied by the patient, and the planned COVID swab. It misrepresents the transcript as focusing only on asthma, ignoring the infectious screening entirely.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: symptoms screened (colds/infections denied D-21/P-21; taste/smell denied D-25/P-25; fevers denied D-26/P-26; nausea/vomiting denied D-27/P-27; belly pain denied D-28/P-28; dry cough D-14/P-14); exposures (sick at home denied D-22/P-22; outside contacts denied D-23/P-23; travel denied D-24/P-24); explanation (D-29); COVID swab planned despite negatives (D-29). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead listing unrelated asthma symptoms/triggers (wheezing, SOB, chest tightness, exercise, cold, pollen).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of infectious screening content ('no information available', 'focus exclusively on asthma'), which is directly verifiable in transcript (D-21-D-29); cites irrelevant segments (e.g., D-19, P-9) for asthma details not pertinent to the question; fabricates that infectious/COVID screening is absent despite clear evidence.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer does not address the question on infectious screening symptoms, patient responses, or planned test; instead denies existence of relevant info and diverts to off-topic asthma assessment and triggers, making it largely irrelevant."
