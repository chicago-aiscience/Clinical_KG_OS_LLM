  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main respiratory symptoms from [P-1] (increased cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea), sinus pressure from [P-12], and identifies cough as most bothersome from [P-12], consistent with Gold. However, it has factual errors: omits reduced exercise tolerance [P-4] listed in Gold as respiratory; incorrectly states patient 'did not report' fever [P-9-11] or headache [P-14] 'during this specific description in [P-1]' implying she didn't report them at all, contradicting Gold which includes them as systemic symptoms reported during the acute worsening; minor wrong citation of [P-1] for most bothersome. Significant discrepancies in systemic symptoms coverage.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Respiratory (increased cough freq [P-1], incr sputum green-yellow [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], worsened dyspnea [P-1], reduced exercise tol [P-4]); Systemic (fever [P-9-11], sinus pressure [P-12], headache [P-14]); most bothersome cough [P-12]. Generated covers increased cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea (partial), sinus pressure, most bothersome cough (6/8 key points, ~75%, misses exercise tol, fever, headache). Pertinent negatives in Gold not required by question.",
    "faithfulness": "All respiratory claims directly verifiable in [P-1]; sinus pressure in [P-12]; denial of other systemic symptoms 'during ... [P-1]' verifiable as they appear later; most bothersome verifiable in [P-12] (minor issue citing [P-1] inaccurately). No hallucinations, fully grounded with accurate citations except minor.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response into respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, and most bothersome symptom, directly addressing the question with no off-topic content."
