  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the child sometimes takes OTC Reactine/“over the counter stuff” for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications (consistent with [P-36], [P-46]-[P-47]). It does not introduce any direct contradictions to the Gold Answer. However, it omits an important fact relevant to the question—no medication/treatment is given for the current wheezing episodes—and includes an unsupported reference to a “Knowledge Graph,” which is not in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) intermittent OTC antihistamine use (Reactine/OTC) for seasonal allergies; (2) no prescribed medications. Key points missed: (1) for the current wheezing/SOB episodes, the mother gives her nothing and symptoms resolve with rest ([P-33]-[P-34]); (2) reinforcement that she has no regular medications aside from occasional Reactine ([P-46]-[P-47]); (3) past viral infections did not require antibiotics ([P-16]). Overall coverage is partial (~50–70% of the Gold Answer’s key points, and it misses a central element for “current respiratory episodes”).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are supported by the transcript (Reactine/OTC allergy meds; no prescribed meds). The mention of a “Knowledge Graph” is not supported by the transcript and is an extraneous, unverifiable assertion. Otherwise, the answer is largely grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on medication/treatment use and whether any prescribed medications are involved, which directly addresses the question. It has minimal tangential content."
