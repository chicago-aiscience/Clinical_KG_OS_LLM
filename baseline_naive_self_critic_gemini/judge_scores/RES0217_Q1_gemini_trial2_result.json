  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It claims the patient reported joint pain, whereas the transcript shows the patient explicitly denied 'other joint pain' [P-7] and clarified that the soreness behind her knee was in the 'skin... not the joint itself' [P-1]. The answer correctly identifies the denial of fever and headaches.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details from the Gold Answer, including the patient's description of the tick being 'stuck pretty good' and the explicit denial of a bullseye/target rash. While it identifies the screening for joint pain, it fails to correctly categorize it as a 'denied' symptom as requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misinterprets the transcript. It conflates the local skin soreness mentioned in [P-1] with systemic joint pain, despite the patient specifically stating 'not the joint itself'. This leads to an inaccurate claim that the patient reported a symptom she actually denied.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses both parts of the question (local symptoms and systemic screening), but its utility is compromised by the incorrect reporting of the patient's responses."
