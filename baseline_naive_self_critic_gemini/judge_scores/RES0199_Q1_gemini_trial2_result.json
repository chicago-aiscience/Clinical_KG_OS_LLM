{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a factual error regarding the onset of diarrhea, stating it began roughly 4 days ago, whereas the transcript [P-28] and Gold Answer specify it started 2 days ago. Other facts (cough nature, vomiting count, headache severity) are correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific characteristics present in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of sputum or blood in the cough, the stable severity of respiratory symptoms, the specific contents of the vomit (food, no blood), the location of the headache (forehead/top of head), and the absence of radiation or neck stiffness. It also omits the loss of smell and fatigue.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, but it hallucinates the '4-day' onset for diarrhea by misinterpreting [P-1] and ignoring the more specific timeline given in [P-28].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the specific components of the question (cough nature, diarrhea frequency, vomiting episodes, and headache severity)."
