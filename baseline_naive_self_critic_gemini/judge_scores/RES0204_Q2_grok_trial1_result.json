  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims no diagnostic procedures were proposed and no rationale for COVID swab is given, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript where [D-37] proposes chest X-ray and [D-39] proposes COVID swab with rationale ('we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately'). This is a major factual error, making it mostly incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: no meds [D-27,P-27]; chest X-ray proposed [D-37] with explanation [D-39]; COVID swab [D-39] with protocol rationale; discomfort noted; plan to arrange/discuss [D-40]. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead wrongly claiming insufficient transcript info.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that transcript 'cuts off prior to' proposals, ignoring [D-37] and [D-39]; its citations ([D-4],[P-2],[D-16],[P-16],[P-13],[P-15],[P-17],[P-18]) are to early symptom review only, fabricating absence of key later content. Largely ungrounded and fabricated claim of incompleteness.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly responds to the question by claiming inability to answer due to transcript limitations and cites some transcript parts, but veers off-topic by misrepresenting content and not addressing actual proposals/rationale; partially relevant."
