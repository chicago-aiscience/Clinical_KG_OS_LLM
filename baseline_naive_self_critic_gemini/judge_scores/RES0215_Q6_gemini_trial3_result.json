  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It states that the doctor's plan is not included and that the transcript ends at [P-44]. However, the transcript continues to [P-59], and the doctor's plan is explicitly stated in [D-58] (physical exam, consulting a physician, and discussing next steps).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses 100% of the doctor's stated plan. Regarding environmental factors, it mentions weather and allergies but misses all home-specific factors detailed in the gold answer (smoking, carpets, pets, fireplaces, and air filters).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant hallucination/error by claiming the transcript ends at [P-44] when the source text provided clearly contains 59 segments. It fails to ground itself in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the question, its failure to acknowledge the second half of the transcript makes it largely irrelevant and unhelpful for the user's query."
