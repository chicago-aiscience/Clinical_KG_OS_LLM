{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the gold answer regarding the link between the patient's symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheezing, chest tightness) and asthma. It correctly identifies that the bronchodilator is intended to relieve these symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses significant context from the gold answer. Specifically, it fails to mention the patient's long-term diagnosis (since age eight), the specific baseline of medication use (once every two weeks), and the triggers (exercise, cold). Crucially, it overlooks the 'rule-out' section where the clinician screens for infections (fever, sick contacts, etc.), which is essential for explaining why it is NOT a new respiratory condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript. However, it references a 'clinical knowledge graph' and 'KG' which are not present in the source transcript. The citations provided (e.g., [P-1], [P-15]) are accurate, though it attributes chest tightness to [P-16] rather than [P-20].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on the symptoms and medication use mentioned in the question."
