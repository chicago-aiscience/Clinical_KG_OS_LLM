    "correctness": "Gold Answer states patient's meds are multivitamins only [P-40], notes pre-diabetic with no prescription meds [P-33], no HTN [P-34], no cholesterol [P-35]. Generated Answer incorrectly claims 'does not report a current medication regimen' and references irrelevant gallbladder [P-30], missing multivitamins entirely—this is a significant factual error and contradiction on the medication part. Allergy (penicillin [P-37]) and reaction (rash [P-38]) match Gold exactly. Overall, significant factual errors on one of three core question parts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: meds=multivitamins only [P-40]; pre-diabetic no Rx [P-33]; no HTN/cholesterol [P-34,P-35]; allergy=penicillin [P-37]; reaction=rash [P-38]; no breathing issues [P-39]. Generated covers allergy and rash fully; completely misses meds/multivitamins and contextual details on no other conditions/meds; includes irrelevant gallbladder. Covers ~50-60% of key points (2/5 main elements).",
    "faithfulness": "Allergy [P-37] and rash [P-38] verifiable in transcript. Incorrectly states no meds despite direct quote in [P-40] 'I just take multivitamins'. Hallucinates 'knowledge graph provided' and its support—not present in transcript or input. References gallbladder [P-30] verifiable but irrelevant. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three question parts (meds regimen, drug allergy, adverse reaction) with headings. Minor off-topic mentions (gallbladder, knowledge graph) but focused on query overall."
