  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several factual errors. It claims there is no evidence of which symptom appeared first and that no change in predominance was described, both of which are contradicted by [P-3] ('stuffy at first, but now it's mostly running'). It also labels symptoms as intermittent based on [P-1], failing to account for the patient's clarification in [P-8] that symptoms were 'pretty constant'.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer regarding the specific progression of symptoms. It misses the shift from congestion to rhinorrhea and the final determination that symptoms were constant rather than intermittent.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the transcript lacks specific evidence for the symptom order and progression. These details are explicitly present in the transcript at [P-3]. It also ignores the clarification at [P-8].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant in that it directly attempts to answer the specific questions posed in the prompt, even though the information provided is incorrect."
