  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately represents all key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the four main factors: exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), tick attachment duration (>72 hours), geographic risk (Strathroy assessed as concerning), and prior history (bullseye rash ~10 years ago requiring antibiotics). It also correctly notes that despite the tick not resembling a deer tick and no current bullseye rash, prophylaxis was recommended. All facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components from the Gold Answer: exposure history with uncertainty about source, 72-hour attachment duration calculation, Strathroy geographic assessment using Ontario Lyme disease map, prior tick bite with bullseye rash and antibiotic treatment, lack of deer tick appearance, absence of current bullseye rash, patient's awareness of changing tick risk guidelines, and the 'safer than not' rationale. The answer includes proper transcript citations [P-1], [P-3], [D-6], [D-13]. Minor omissions include the specific quote about 'all ticks in this area as possibly carriers' and the lab identification proposal, but these are secondary details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript. The exposure history matches P-1, the 72-hour duration matches D-6, the geographic assessment matches D-12/D-13, and the prior history matches P-3. The statement about the tick not resembling a deer tick is supported by P-5, and the absence of current bullseye rash is confirmed in P-6. The citations are accurate and appropriate. No hallucinated information is present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the question: exposure history, tick attachment duration, geographic risk assessment, and prior history with bullseye rash. It explains how these factors combined to justify prophylactic antibiotics despite the tick's appearance and lack of current rash. The 'Reference to Context' section specifically addresses the apparent contradiction mentioned in the question. No irrelevant information is included."
