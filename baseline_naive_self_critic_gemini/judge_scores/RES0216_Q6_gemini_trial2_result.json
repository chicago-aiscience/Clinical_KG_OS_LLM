  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns well with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the doctor's suspicion of asthma recurrence and the lower likelihood of cardiac ischemia based on the doctor's interpretation of the symptoms (D-36). It accurately reflects the planned physical exam (listening to lungs) and the trial of rescue puffers.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points: the assessment (asthma), the exam (lungs), the first step (rescue puffers), and the contingency (revisit the assessment). It misses two smaller details present in the Gold Answer: 1) the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician ('the doc') before finalizing next steps, and 2) the explicit 'one thing at a time' stepwise philosophy mentioned in D-36.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It correctly cites sections such as D-35 and D-36. It accurately captures the doctor's specific reasoning regarding chest tightness versus shortness of breath as a differentiator for cardiac issues, even correctly reflecting the doctor's summary in D-36.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses all parts of the multi-part question, including assessment, physical exam, first treatment, and contingency."
