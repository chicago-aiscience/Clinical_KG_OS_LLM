  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medication (Keppra) and the specific quote where the patient links the missed dose to the seizure (P-9). However, it attributes part of the reasoning to a 'Knowledge Graph' which does not exist in the provided source material.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer, including the specific reason for the missed dose (the daughter's birthday/dinner routine disruption), the fact that the patient usually doesn't have frequent seizures, and the context that this was a voluntary admission rather than a response to a direct question about medication adherence.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates an external source, referring to a 'Knowledge Graph' and specific semantic triples ([RISK_FACTOR]...[PRECIPITATES]...) that are not present in the transcript. While the conclusion is logically sound, the attribution is fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question (the connection and the evidence of patient recognition)."
