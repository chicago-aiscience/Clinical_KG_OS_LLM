  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication for epilepsy from P-23 and P-8, and specifies the daughter's birthday celebration as the circumstance for missing the dose from P-24, including details on routine change. The Generated Answer incorrectly states the medication name is not explicitly documented (contradicting P-23 where patient says 'I'm taking Keppra'), only vaguely references forgetting from P-9 without the specific birthday detail, and adds unverified claims about adherence precipitating seizures with a fabricated [KG] citation. Major factual errors and contradictions with Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Keppra for epilepsy [P-23,P-8]; forgot med [P-9]; daughter's birthday celebration changed dinner routine leading to forget [P-24]; doctor's acknowledgment [D-24,D-25]; link to seizure. Generated covers only vague forgetting [P-9] and epilepsy link; misses medication name, specific circumstance (birthday), routine details, and doctor's notes. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated falsely claims medication name not documented (P-23 explicitly states Keppra); correctly cites P-9 for forgetting but omits P-23 and P-24 details; hallucinates [KG] citation not in transcript and implies general knowledge not verifiable there. Multiple inaccuracies and fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Generated attempts to address both medication and circumstance parts of the question directly, though inaccurately and incompletely; minor extraneous claim on adherence as precipitant but stays on-topic."
