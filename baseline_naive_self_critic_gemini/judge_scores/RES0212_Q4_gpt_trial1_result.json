  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple factual errors compared with the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states/attributes denials: nausea/vomiting were denied at [P-17] (not [P-19]); stiff neck was denied at [P-18] (not “I don’t think so” at [P-19]). It also incorrectly claims that night sweats and weight loss were not explicitly screened for, when they were directly asked and denied ([D-5/P-5], [D-6–D-8/P-6–P-8]). It omits hemoptysis denial ([D-10/P-10]) and most exposure-risk screening (sick contacts, travel, IV drug use). Its discussion of “meningitis or pleuritis” as the main serious conditions excluded is not aligned with the Gold Answer’s emphasis (TB, endemic infections, malignancy) and is not well-supported by the transcript in this context.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer items missed: (1) night sweats/soaked sheets denial; (2) unexplained weight loss/loose clothes denial; (3) hemoptysis denial; (4) exposure-risk denials: sick contacts at class, recent sick contacts, roommate sick, recent travel/exotic locales, cocaine/heroin use, IV drug use; (5) the Gold Answer’s rationale that these screen for TB/endemic infections and that hemoptysis also helps lower concern for lung malignancy; (6) denial of body pain/tenderness. The Generated Answer only partially mentions chest pain, nausea/vomiting, and stiff neck, and even those are inaccurately cited/quoted. Overall coverage is well under half of required points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not grounded or are contradicted by the transcript: incorrect citation of nausea/vomiting and stiff neck denials; incorrect statement that night sweats/weight loss were not explicitly screened; and extrapolation to excluding meningitis/pleuritis as key targets of the screening without transcript support. This constitutes multiple hallucinations/misattributions.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at constitutional symptoms/exposure risks and serious conditions to exclude, but it focuses on the wrong/less central symptoms and misses most of what was asked (the specific denied constitutional symptoms and exposure risks that were screened). It is only partially responsive to the question."
