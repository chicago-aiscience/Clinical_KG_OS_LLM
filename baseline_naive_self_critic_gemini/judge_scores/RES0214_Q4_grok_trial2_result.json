  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test ordered [D-53], matching the Gold Answer. It accurately captures the core rationale of household transmission from the husband [P-19, D-53] and the doctor's statement prioritizing COVID-19 to rule out first. However, it introduces extraneous references to a 'knowledge graph' (not present in the Gold Answer or transcript) and interpretive phrasing like 'patient likely contracted the virus from him' (doctor uses conditional 'if'), representing minor discrepancies but core facts remain consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: test ordered (swab [D-53]), household transmission/epidemiological context [P-19, D-53], prioritization quote [D-53]. Partially covers infectious nature via self-isolation implication but does not explicitly mention the self-isolation instruction [D-53] or the sequencing of influenza as a secondary possibility after no flu shot [P-53, D-54]. Covers approximately 80-90% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about test, symptoms [P-1], husband [P-19], and doctor's statements [D-53] are verifiable in transcript. However, repeated mentions of a 'knowledge graph' linking symptoms and risk factors are not in the transcript (hallucination). Interpretive 'likely contracted' is plausible but not directly stated. Mostly grounded with minor unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around the diagnostic test and prioritization rationale, with no off-topic content, perfectly addressing the question."
