  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major error regarding pre-visit self-treatment. The transcript explicitly states the patient had not tried anything for symptom relief (\"No, I haven't tried anything\" [P-9]) and takes no medications [P-24], whereas the Generated Answer claims the patient \"had taken edibles\" as a pre-visit treatment. While edibles are mentioned in the social history [P-34], they were not used to treat the presenting symptoms and the patient specifically denied trying any OTC or other measures. The doctor’s recommendation of a COVID swab test and self-isolation instructions are accurately captured.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: COVID-19 swab testing recommendation; instruction to self-isolate until results and potentially longer if symptoms persist. Key points missed: explicit statement that the patient tried no treatments/OTC meds for symptoms; confirmation of no regular medications; the expected turnaround time for results (\"a day or two\"); mention of possibly doing other tests; plan to discuss with supervising physician before finalizing next steps.",
    "faithfulness": "Most elements (COVID swab and isolation guidance) are directly supported by [D-39]. However, the statement implying pre-visit treatment with edibles is not faithful to the clinical context: the patient denied trying anything for symptoms [P-9], and edibles were only mentioned as past, infrequent marijuana use [P-34], not as a symptom treatment. This is a context distortion rather than a pure hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally directed at the question (what was tried pre-visit and what was recommended during the visit). However, it introduces an irrelevant/incorrect item (edibles) as a pre-visit treatment and omits several requested instruction details (e.g., result timing), reducing how well it fulfills the prompt."
