  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate on all core elements of the management plan (COVID swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, supportive care details including hydration, nutrition, rest, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches), matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. Minor discrepancies include omitting the results timeframe ('24 to 48 hours') and the alternative diagnosis ('another viral illness'), which are present in both Gold and transcript but not central to the question's specified components.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points from Gold: diagnostic test (swab, but misses timeframe), self-isolation duration (14 days), contact tracing conditions (if positive), all supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleeping well, Tylenol for fevers if any, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Missed: results timeframe, alternative diagnosis mention, explicit note on no other prescriptions. Covers approximately 85-90% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in transcript [D-52], with accurate citations; includes faithful rephrasing (e.g., 'resting well (or sleeping well)' for 'sleeping well', 'anseads' corrected to NSAIDs); no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response around the exact elements requested (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), with no off-topic content."
