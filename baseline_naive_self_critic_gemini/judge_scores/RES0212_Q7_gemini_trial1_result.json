  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three-month onset, the one-month duration of sleep disruption, and the recent (few days) onset of productive greenish sputum. However, it fails on the 'subjective fevers' component. It claims the patient did not report subjective fevers, whereas the transcript (P-4) explicitly records the patient saying she felt 'hot at night in the past couple days,' which constitutes a subjective fever as noted in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer addresses all four specific timeline components requested in the prompt: initial onset, sleep disruption, productive cough, and subjective fevers. It misses the specific 'three days' detail for the sputum (using the vaguer 'past few days' from P-2 rather than the specific 'three days' from P-12), and provides an incorrect negative response for the fever component.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded, but the claim that the patient 'does not mention fever' is a hallucination of absence that contradicts P-4. It correctly cites other sections like P-19 and P-13.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly focused on the question, using the requested timeline structure to organize the information."
