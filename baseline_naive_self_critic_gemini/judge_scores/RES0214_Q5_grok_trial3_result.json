  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: husband's week-long similar illness suggesting household transmission (cited correctly), limited outside contact (implied through household focus and hiking mention), and lack of flu shot elevating influenza risk. Doctor's prioritization of COVID-19 [D-53] and consideration of influenza [D-54] match perfectly. Minor discrepancies include unsubstantiated 'Knowledge Graph Connections' not present in Gold or transcript, and phrasing like 'simultaneous onset' (actually sequential: husband 1 week, patient 3 days), but no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: husband's symptoms and household transmission (100%), no flu shot and its role (100%), doctor's prioritization of COVID and secondary flu (100%). Limited outside contact partially covered conceptually (household internal transmission emphasized, hiking [P-18] noted), but misses explicit citations/references to work from home [P-23,P-42], staying home [P-22], no other sick contacts [P-17]. Covers ~85-90% with strong conceptual match.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable: husband's symptoms [P-19/20, D-51/53], no flu shot [D-53/P-53], doctor's diagnostic strategy [D-53/54], hiking [P-18]. Citations accurate. Hallucinations include 'Knowledge Graph Connections' (e.g., [MEDICAL_HISTORY] links) not in transcript, 'biological rationale,' and minor 'simultaneous onset' inaccuracy (transmission is sequential). Plausible additions but some unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring around the specified risk factors (husband's illness, household context, no flu shot) and explaining their collective impact on prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza in the differential, with no off-topic content."
