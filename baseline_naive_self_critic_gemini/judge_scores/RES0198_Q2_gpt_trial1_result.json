{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all directly queried elements: (1) patient tried OTC “decongestants” (P-10); (2) patient felt it “worked a little bit” (P-10); and (3) clinician recommended OTC symptomatic therapy, specifically mentioning “Tylenol Cold” (D-39). No conflicting or incorrect statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "It includes the three core items needed to answer the question (prior med tried, perceived effectiveness, OTC recommendation). Compared to the Gold Answer, it omits additional clinician recommendations bundled into the Gold (e.g., supportive care details like hydration and the expectation that symptoms may take a few weeks). Those are present in the Gold, but not strictly necessary for the asked OTC-treatment portion; still, relative to Gold Answer key points, they are missing.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript (decongestants and ‘worked a little bit’ in P-10; Tylenol Cold recommendation in D-39). No hallucinated medications or effects.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the medication tried, the patient’s assessment, and the clinician’s OTC recommendation. No tangential content."

  "summary": "Accurate, transcript-grounded, and highly relevant; slightly less than fully complete relative to the Gold Answer due to omission of ancillary supportive-care details included there (e.g., hydration/expected duration)."
