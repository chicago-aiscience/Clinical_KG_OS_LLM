  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is entirely incorrect. It claims the transcript does not contain the doctor's plan or physical examination components and asserts the transcript ends at [P-35]. In reality, [D-37] explicitly details the plan to listen to the patient's heart and lungs, perform a physical exam, consult with a supervising doctor, and then return to discuss next steps.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points requested in the prompt. It provides zero information regarding the physical exam components or the process for determining next steps, both of which were present in the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends at [P-35]. It completely ignores the subsequent dialogue ([D-36] through [P-38]) which contains the evidence needed to answer the question.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question effectively. By incorrectly claiming the information is missing, it provides no relevant clinical details to the user's inquiry."
