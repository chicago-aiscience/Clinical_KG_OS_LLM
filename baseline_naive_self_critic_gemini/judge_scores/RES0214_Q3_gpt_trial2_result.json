  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key presenting symptoms discussed in the transcript (fever and sore throat, with preceding nasal congestion) and correctly links them to the clinician’s stated rationale for ruling out infectious causes including COVID-19 (explicitly referenced at D-53). It also correctly reports the vaccination-history detail (no flu shot this year) and the clinician’s resulting inclusion of influenza as a differential (D-54). No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core symptoms emphasized in the Gold Answer (fever and sore throat) and includes stuffy nose as part of the symptom cluster. It fully captures the vaccination-history trigger for influenza (no flu shot this year). However, it omits two supporting elements highlighted in the Gold Answer: (1) the doctor’s broader symptom summary including muscle aches (D-24), and (2) the epidemiologic context that the husband had similar symptoms, which the doctor used to prioritize COVID-19 (D-53).",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are verifiable in the transcript: fever/stuffy nose/sore throat (P-1), the doctor’s fever+sore throat infectious framing (D-53), flu-shot question (D-53), patient’s “No” (P-53), and influenza possibility (D-54). No hallucinated facts or unsupported extrapolations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question: (1) which presenting symptoms suggested an infectious/COVID-19 etiology and (2) what vaccination-history detail raised influenza as a differential. No meaningful irrelevant content."
