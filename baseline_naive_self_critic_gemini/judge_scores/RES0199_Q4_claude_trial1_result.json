  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, the swab as the diagnostic test, 24-48 hours as the turnaround time, and viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. All facts align with the transcript references provided in [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer including: (1) COVID-19 as primary condition, (2) swab test ordered, (3) 24-48 hour turnaround, (4) alternative viral illness diagnosis. However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer such as the 14-day isolation instruction, contact tracing if positive, and the note about supportive management being the same regardless of diagnosis. These are supplementary details rather than core answer components, but their absence represents minor incompleteness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The answer provides accurate citations and does not introduce any information not present in the source material. The formatting as a bulleted list with explicit transcript references demonstrates strong grounding in the source document.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the multi-part question: the condition to rule out, the diagnostic test, the turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis. The response is well-organized, focused, and contains no irrelevant information. The bulleted format makes it easy to identify how each part of the question is answered."

It correctly identifies all key elements: COVID-19 as the primary concern, swab testing with 24-48 hour turnaround, and viral illness as the alternative diagnosis.

Minor points are deducted for completeness due to omission of contextual details like isolation instructions and contact tracing procedures, though these are supplementary rather than essential to answering the core question."
