  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the medication tried ('decongestants' from [P-10]), the patient's assessment ('worked a little bit' from [P-10]), and the recommended OTC treatment ('Tylenol cold' from [D-39]), fully consistent with the Gold Answer's core facts; minor discrepancy in not elaborating the ambiguous reasoning behind the assessment (stuffy to runny transition) or including hydration/expectations, but no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: decongestants tried [P-10], assessment 'worked a little bit' [P-10], Tylenol Cold recommended [D-39]; missed: full assessment nuance (reasoning about runny nose indicating partial success), hydration as supportive care, viral illness taking weeks, and limited options beyond supportive care—covers ~85% of Gold's details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: 'decongestants' and 'worked a little bit' in [P-10], 'Tylenol cold' in [D-39]; citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the three-part question (medication tried, assessment, OTC recommended) with no off-topic content or tangents."
