  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies a triad including dry cough (worsening over 3 days), fever (100.1-101°F on Friday), and possible loss of taste (P-17 parent report) leading to COVID alignment (D-44), with fever distinguishing infection from asthma (D-45). Generated Answer denies taste change is documented (incorrect, as P-17 explicitly mentions parent suspicion of loss of taste), misstates cough duration as doctor-confirmed 5 days (D-3, but parent corrects to 3 days in P-4), adds unconfirmed shortness of breath as key respiratory symptom (P-8 is uncertain), and omits specifics like dry quality, acute onset, fatigue, and appetite loss. Core logic on fever for infection is correct, but significant discrepancies on symptoms for COVID alignment contradict Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: triad of cough (dry, worsening 3 days [P-1,P-5,P-12]), fever specifics/emergence [P-1,P-2], taste loss [P-17]; D-44 COVID alignment; D-45 fever -> infection vs asthma; systemic signs (fever, fatigue, appetite). Generated covers cough worsening and fever for infection/COVID (D-44,D-45), recommends swab. Misses taste entirely (denies), fever details/emergence, dry quality, exact 3-day timeline, systemic context. Covers ~50-60% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: dry cough worsening [P-1,P-5,P-12], temp ~100-101 [P-1,P-2], D-44/D-45 logic on fever/infection vs asthma/COVID swab. Unverifiable/hallucinated: denies taste symptom despite P-17 parent report ('wonder if losing sense of taste'); doctor confirmed '5 days' [D-3, accurate but ignores correction]; portrays shortness of breath as definite respiratory complaint despite P-8 uncertainty ('maybe'). Multiple distortions, especially denying documented symptom.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom combination for COVID alignment and infectious conclusion via cough+fever+D-44/D-45, structured similarly to Gold. However, dismisses taste (specified in question) as undocumented, partially undermining focus on queried triad; still mostly on-topic with minor off-point denial."
