  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the prioritization of COVID-19 due to household transmission from the husband and the inclusion of influenza as a secondary differential due to the lack of vaccination.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key points: 1) The husband's illness as a sign of household transmission, 2) The limited outside contact (working from home, no travel beyond hiking) supporting internal exposure, and 3) The lack of a flu shot as the reason for including influenza in the differential. It captures the doctor's specific strategy of prioritizing the COVID-19 swab while keeping influenza as a possibility.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, providing specific citations (e.g., [D-53], [P-53], [P-18]) for every major claim. While it introduces 'Knowledge Graph Connection' labels to explain the logic, the underlying clinical reasoning is grounded in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, focusing specifically on how the epidemiological factors mentioned in the prompt influence the doctor's diagnostic process without including unnecessary details about the patient's past medical history (like the gallbladder surgery)."
