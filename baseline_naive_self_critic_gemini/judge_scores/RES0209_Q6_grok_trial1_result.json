{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly asserts that the transcript ends at [P-32] and does not include the clinician's plan, COVID-19 test, medication changes, or consultation with the supervising physician, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and the actual transcript which extends to [D-44] with explicit mentions (e.g., COVID swab in [D-29], medication change in [D-43], consultation in [D-29] and [D-43]). All facts are inconsistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: 1) COVID swab ([D-29]); 2) medication regimen change ([D-43]); 3) consultation with supervising physician ([D-29], [D-43]). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying their presence and summarizing unrelated symptoms and history.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends early at [P-32] (false, continues to [D-44]); references non-existent 'knowledge graph' and 'provided context segments'; all claims about missing plan elements are unverifiable and contradicted by transcript; largely fabricated.",
    "relevance": "Question specifically asks for clinician's overall plan including COVID test, med changes, and physician consultation; Generated Answer refuses to answer claiming insufficient context (falsely), then diverts to symptom summary and asthma diagnosis, failing to address the core query."
