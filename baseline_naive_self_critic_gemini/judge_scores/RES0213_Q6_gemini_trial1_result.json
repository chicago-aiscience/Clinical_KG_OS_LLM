  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor did not provide concluding remarks or a stated plan, whereas the transcript (and Gold Answer) clearly shows the doctor planning to pass the information to another physician in [D-33]. It also claims the dialogue ends earlier than it actually does. While it correctly identifies some clinical facts (family history, smoking, stress), the fundamental error regarding the conclusion is a significant factual failure.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to address the first part of the question regarding the stated plan. Regarding clinical information, it misses several key areas covered in the Gold Answer: OTC medication attempts (Tylenol, Advil), pertinent negatives (no trauma, no fevers, no asthma, no arrhythmias), and psychosocial details (living alone, multivitamin use).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the dialogue ends prematurely. Furthermore, it incorporates external 'Knowledge Graph (KG)' context and relationships that are not present in the provided source transcript, violating the grounding requirement.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. It addresses the clinical information gathered but completely dismisses the first part of the prompt (the stated plan) based on the false premise that it was not provided in the text."
