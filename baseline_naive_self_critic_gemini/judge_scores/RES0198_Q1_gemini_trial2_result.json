  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the primary symptoms (stuffy and runny nose). However, it fails to include the 'mostly clear' characterization of the discharge, which is a core fact in the Gold Answer and transcript. Most significantly, it makes a factually incorrect claim that the patient did not explicitly state the word 'no' during the encounter; in reality, the transcript shows the patient using 'No' or 'Nope' at least five times (e.g., [P-4], [P-7], [P-14], [P-16]).",
    "completeness": "The answer covers approximately 60-70% of the key points. It identifies the nasal symptoms and most denied symptoms (cough, sore throat, fever, etc.). However, it misses the duration (one week), the specific discharge character (mostly clear), and the 'post-nasal drip' which was explicitly requested in the prompt. It also omits several pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer (chest pain, bowel/urinary changes).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination/misinterpretation regarding the dialogue. It claims the patient did not explicitly deny symptoms with the word 'no,' but the transcript contains multiple instances where the patient says exactly that. This misrepresents the source text's structure and content.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, organizing its findings into the specific categories requested by the prompt and focusing only on clinical symptoms and denials."
