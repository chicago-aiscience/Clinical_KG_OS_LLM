  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core symptoms (dry cough [P-1, D-58], scratchy throat [P-1], headache [P-1], subjective fever [P-7, D-58]) and absences (no sputum [implied D-58, confirmed earlier P-5/P-6], no GI [P-11/P-12], no joint pain [P-13]) supporting URI, consistent with Gold Answer. Minor discrepancies include incorrect citation of sputum question to [D-58] (actual in D-5/D-6), introduction of unmentioned 'knowledge graph' for malaise, and omission of fatigue [P-13], malaise [P-14/D-15], timeline details, and brother's cold [P-39]; however, main interpretive points align without major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: upper symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache), subjective fever/malaise, no sputum (upper vs lower), no GI, no joint pain, doctor summary [D-58]. Misses ~10-20%: explicit malaise [P-14/D-15], fatigue [P-13], precise 3-4 day timeline progression [P-1/P-3/P-4], brother's recent cold [P-39] as exposure source.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: symptoms and denials directly from transcript with mostly accurate citations (e.g., P-1, P-7, D-58). Minor issues: sputum query mis-cited to [D-58] (earlier D-5/6), 'knowledge graph' hallucinated/not in transcript, but plausible for malaise ('crappy' [P-1/P-14]). No major fabrications; grounded overall.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around how listed symptoms and absences support URI diagnosis, with breakdown mirroring question elements; no tangents."
