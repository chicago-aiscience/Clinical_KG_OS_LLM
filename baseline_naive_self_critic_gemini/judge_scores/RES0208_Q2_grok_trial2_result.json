  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer lists two current medications: Avodart (dutasteride) for enlarged prostate (BPH) [P-25,P-26] and Tums for reflux [P-27]. Generated Answer only lists Tums for reflux [P-27] and omits Avodart entirely, despite patient explicitly stating 'I take avodart' [P-26] for prostate issues [P-25]. The change to reflux regimen (stopped prior prescription med after identifying trigger foods) is accurately described [P-27]. This omission of a key current medication represents a significant factual error, as the Gold Answer and transcript confirm two current meds.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Avodart/dutasteride for enlarged prostate/BPH [P-25,P-26]; 2) Tums (OTC antacid) as-needed for reflux [P-27]; 3) Previously on unnamed prescription med for reflux; 4) Independently stopped it after figuring out helpful foods/diet management [P-27]; 5) Doctor's positive response and no allergies [D-28,P-28]. Generated covers: Tums for reflux (point 2), prior med stopped and reason (points 3-4). Misses: Avodart/BPH (point 1), specifics like dutasteride name/BPH clarification, Tums as 'here and there'/as-needed, doctor's response, allergies. Covers approximately 50-60% of key points (one med and change, but misses the other med and details).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (Tums for reflux [P-27], stopped prior prescription med [P-27], reason: figured out foods to manage via diet [P-27]) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citation to P-27. No hallucinated facts, unverifiable details, or inaccuracies in what is stated; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly to address the question with sections on 'Current Medications and Conditions' (lists Tums for reflux) and 'Changes to Previous Reflux Medication Regimen' (details stop of prior med and why), using transcript citations. No irrelevant content or tangents, though incomplete on current meds; perfectly focused on the query topics."
