  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma/Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction, which matches the Gold Answer. It accurately cites the transcript for exercise triggers, cold weather exacerbation, resolution with rest, and seasonal allergies.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers several key points (exercise, cold weather, rest, allergies) but misses three specific categories of evidence provided in the Gold Answer: the occurrence across multiple settings (to rule out single environmental triggers), the nocturnal symptoms (P-43/P-44), and the pertinent negatives (absence of fever, phlegm, etc.) which help rule out infectious causes.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All cited points (P-1, P-2, P-3, P-6, P-35, P-38) are accurate and reflect the dialogue correctly without any hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly relevant, directly answering the question and using the evidence categories suggested in the prompt while providing the corresponding transcript references."
