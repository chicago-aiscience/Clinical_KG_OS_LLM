  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims no plan was communicated, which is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor communicated plans for chest X-ray [D-37], COVID swab [D-39], consultation with supervising physician [D-37, D-40], and follow-up [D-40]. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the structured visit plan explained at onset, (2) chest X-ray proposal, (3) COVID swab as standard protocol, (4) age-appropriate explanations, (5) consultation with supervising physician, (6) follow-up plan. It covers 0% of required elements while focusing on irrelevant clinical summary.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes false claims not supported by the transcript. It states 'the doctor's complete plan...was not communicated' when D-37, D-39, and D-40 clearly document the communicated plan. The claim that 'consultation transcript concludes with...review of systems' ignores D-37-D-42 which contain the plan discussion.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question. Instead of describing the doctor's communicated plan (the actual question), it provides an unsolicited clinical summary of symptoms and history, then claims no plan exists. This is completely off-topic from what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally flawed across all dimensions. It incorrectly claims no plan was communicated despite clear evidence in D-37, D-39, and D-40 showing chest X-ray, COVID swab, physician consultation, and follow-up were all discussed. It covers none of the required elements from the Gold Answer, makes false claims contradicting the transcript, and provides irrelevant clinical summary instead of answering the question about the communicated plan. This represents a complete failure to accurately extract and report the documented information."
