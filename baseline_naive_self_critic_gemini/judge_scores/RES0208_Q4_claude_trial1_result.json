  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It claims the transcript 'does not contain any explicit instances' of the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, when in fact these are explicitly present: runny nose [D-10, P-10], nausea [D-15, P-15], chest pain [D-16, P-16], and palpitations [D-17, P-17]. This is a major factual contradiction of what appears in the transcript. The interpretation of the clinical differentiation is reasonable but built on an incorrect premise.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses most of the key negated symptoms identified in the Gold Answer: runny nose, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and numbness/tingling. It only discusses breathing difficulty and cough in detail, covering less than 30% of the relevant content. It does not mention vision/hearing changes, urinary symptoms, or numbness/tingling at all.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a critical hallucination by claiming symptoms were not asked about when they clearly were in the transcript. This is a fundamental failure of faithfulness. The citations [D-10, P-10], [D-15, P-15], [D-16, P-16], and [D-17, P-17] directly contradict the Generated Answer's claim. However, the discussion of differential diagnosis concepts appears grounded in medical knowledge, though not explicitly verified against the transcript.",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer attempts to address how symptom absence helps differentiate diagnoses (which is relevant to the question), it fails to correctly identify which symptoms were actually asked about and denied. The clinical reasoning section is relevant but built on faulty premises. About 40% of the content directly addresses the question, but the foundational error undermines the entire response."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains a fundamental factual error by claiming that chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea were not asked about in the transcript, when they clearly were ([D-10, P-10], [D-15, P-15], [D-16, P-16], [D-17, P-17]). This error severely undermines the entire response. The answer misses most key negated symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer (vision/hearing changes, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling) and only covers about 20-30% of the required content. While the clinical reasoning about differential diagnosis is conceptually sound, it is built on incorrect premises about what was discussed in the transcript. The hallucination of absent content that was actually present represents a critical failure of faithfulness to the source material."
