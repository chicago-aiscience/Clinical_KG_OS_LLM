  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual inaccuracies relative to the Gold Answer and transcript. It incorrectly claims that the father's allergies, cousin's asthma, farm living situation, and home-schooling during COVID are not mentioned—these are explicitly stated in the transcript ([P-30], [P-33], [P-41]–[P-45]). It also introduces a “Knowledge Graph (KG)” as a source, which is not part of the provided transcript. While it correctly notes Jessica’s allergies and that her current symptoms occur before her usual allergy season ([P-16], [P-17]) and correctly identifies the brother’s recent cold as a possible exposure ([P-39]), it misses/contradicts the core contextual conclusion emphasized in the Gold Answer (isolated household → intra-household viral exposure most plausible).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) allergy season not started, suggesting symptoms differ from typical allergies; (2) brother had a cold a few weeks ago as potential exposure. Key points missed: (1) explicit family history details (father with allergies, cousin with asthma) and how they contextualize allergic/respiratory predisposition; (2) the farm/outside London setting; (3) home-schooling and parents working from home/farm reducing outside exposures; (4) Jessica rarely leaves the house and no travel, supporting isolation; (5) presence of only a dog and not an animal farm reducing animal-related exposure concerns; (6) synthesis that intra-household transmission is most likely given isolation.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not well-grounded in the transcript because it denies several transcript-supported facts (farm living, home-schooling, father allergies, cousin asthma) and adds an unsupported external element (“Knowledge Graph”). The parts about her seasonal allergies and timing, and brother’s cold, are faithful to the transcript, but overall there are multiple unfaithful claims.",
    "relevance": "The response partially engages with the question by discussing allergies and the brother’s cold, but it fails to address the asked collective relationship because it erroneously states that several central factors are absent from the transcript and therefore does not provide the integrated interpretation (family predisposition + limited external exposure + likely household viral source)."
