  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript and gold answer. It correctly identifies the onset of the cough on Wednesday evening, the fatigue on Thursday, and the worsening cough, fever, and decreased appetite on Friday. The temperature range mentioned (100-101) is also correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the majority of the timeline but misses a few details present in the gold answer. Specifically, it omits the cough's severity change on Thursday (it only mentions fatigue for that day), the presence of a runny nose, and the suspected loss of taste/disinterest in breakfast on Friday. However, it does address all symptoms specifically named in the prompt (fatigue, appetite, fever, cough).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and cited correctly (e.g., [P-1], [P-8], [P-15]). There are no hallucinations; even the speculative point about breathing is correctly framed as the mother's speculation from the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested day-by-day structure to explain the illness's evolution, directly answering the user's specific questions about timing and symptom emergence."
