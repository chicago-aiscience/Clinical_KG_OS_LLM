  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies fever, stuffy nose, and sore throat as key symptoms from the patient's report [P-1] and doctor's summary [D-53/D-24], aligning with the Gold Answer's emphasis on fever and sore throat explicitly [D-53]; however, it omits muscle aches [D-24/D-13-15] and the epidemiological factor of the husband's similar symptoms [D-53], which are highlighted in Gold as supporting COVID-19 suspicion, representing minor discrepancies but core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Covers fever, sore throat, and stuffy nose (key from Gold's explicit and broader symptoms); fully covers vaccination history (no flu shot [P-53] prompting influenza [D-54]); misses muscle aches from doctor's summary [D-24] and husband's symptoms [D-53], covering ~70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: symptoms from [P-1], doctor's note on fever/sore throat [D-53], flu shot question/response [D-53/P-53] and influenza mention [D-54]; citations accurate, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by specifying symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat) for infectious/COVID-19 suspicion and vaccination status for influenza differential; no off-topic content."
