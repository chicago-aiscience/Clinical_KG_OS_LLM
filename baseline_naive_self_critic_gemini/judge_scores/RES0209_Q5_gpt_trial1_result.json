  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient’s current symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheeze) and increased bronchodilator reliance (though it does not quantify the change as in the Gold Answer). It correctly lists the three triggers (exercise, cold air/winter, pollen/spring) and correctly notes the sister has asthma. However, it introduces an inaccurate/unsupported distinction that “pollen is linked to allergies rather than asthma” and implies pollen is not an asthma trigger; the transcript does not state this, and the Gold Answer treats pollen as a patient-identified asthma trigger that raised suspicion for comorbid allergies. It also attributes support to a “knowledge graph [KG],” which is not part of the source transcript and is therefore not an acceptable grounding source here.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) exercise trigger, (2) cold air/winter trigger, (3) spring/pollen trigger, (4) suspicion of undiagnosed allergies (partially), (5) sister with asthma. Key points missing: (a) patient said no other triggers, (b) patient suspected allergies but was never formally diagnosed and clinician said “that would make sense,” (c) clinician revisited allergies later and patient denied other allergies, (d) no other family allergies/breathing problems, (e) quantification of rescue inhaler escalation (once every 2 weeks to 5–6 times/week), (f) clinician suggestion that rescue-only regimen is insufficient and may need daily controller/med change. Overall, it captures roughly half to two-thirds of the Gold Answer’s clinical relations but omits several specific contextual links.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated reliance on “knowledge graph [KG]” content, and the claim that pollen is specifically linked to allergies rather than asthma. The rest of the answer (symptoms, triggers, sister history) is generally supported by cited transcript lines. Because there are multiple explicit non-transcript sources/claims, faithfulness is materially reduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on relating the triggers and family history to the exacerbation and allergy suspicion, which matches the question. Minor extraneous content includes general statements about “supporting the diagnosis” and KG-based assertions, but overall it remains on-topic."
