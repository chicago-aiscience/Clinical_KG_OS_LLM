{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the two primary respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose), their duration, and their characteristics (dry/non-productive and clear discharge). The facts align with the gold answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer: the specific comparison to the patient's medical history (never having a dry cough like this), and multiple pertinent negatives mentioned in the gold answer (chest pain, wheezing, and shortness of breath). It only includes one pertinent negative (sore throat).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer attributes information to a 'knowledge graph' and includes structured labels (e.g., [SYMPTOM] dry cough --[SUBTYPE]--> [SYMPTOM] cough) that are not present in the provided source transcript. While the clinical facts are grounded in the text, the reference to an external knowledge structure is a minor hallucination regarding the source's content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for symptoms and their characteristics without including off-topic information."
