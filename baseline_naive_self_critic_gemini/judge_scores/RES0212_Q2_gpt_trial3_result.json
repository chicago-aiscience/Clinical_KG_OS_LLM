  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes that the patient states she is not taking any medications right now (P-29). However, it incorrectly claims she has not mentioned any previously prescribed medications/treatments: the patient reports eczema treated currently with regular moisturizing cream and that her family doctor previously prescribed a cream when it was bad (P-23). Thus, a key factual statement contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements missed include: (1) current use of moisturizing creams for eczema, (2) prior prescribed eczema cream (unnamed) obtained at Shoppers, (3) contraception status (condoms; no hormonal birth control), and (4) denial of drug/food/bee sting reactions and possible cat allergy context. The Generated Answer only captures the ‘no current meds’ point and mentions marijuana/alcohol, so it covers well under half of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The statement that she ‘has not mentioned any medications previously prescribed’ is not supported by the transcript (P-23 explicitly describes a previously prescribed eczema cream). Other references (marijuana/alcohol use) are grounded, but the central ‘no prior prescriptions’ claim is a clear mismatch, indicating multiple ungrounded/incorrect claims relative to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on medication status, which is what the question asks. It includes a minor irrelevant tangent about symptoms like nausea/pain as ‘evidence’ of no meds, but overall it attempts to answer the medication/treatment question."
