  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer conflicts with the Gold Answer on several core facts. It incorrectly states that night sweats, eczema, and severe allergic reactions/EpiPen were not screened for, when they clearly were (night sweats [D-9]/[P-9], EpiPen/severe allergy symptoms [D-18–D-21]/[P-18–P-21], eczema family history [D-32–D-33]/[P-33]). It also wrongly claims Jessica did not explicitly answer the asthma question; she did (“No” [P-29]). It further implies “no recent exposure” despite Jessica reporting her brother had a cold a few weeks ago [P-39–P-40] (the doctor’s later summary is not aligned with that earlier history). Some elements are correct (doctor asked about asthma; asked about sick contacts; Jessica has seasonal allergies), but major contradictions remain.",
    "completeness": "Key screened conditions in the Gold Answer largely missing: night sweats characterization and response; productive vs nonproductive cough/phlegm denial; severe allergic reaction symptoms (breathing difficulty/facial swelling) and EpiPen status; family history of asthma details; eczema screening; rashes/skin changes; GI symptoms (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea); and joint pain. The Generated Answer covers only a small subset (asthma and a general notion of exposure), well under 20% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims are not grounded in the transcript or directly contradict it: stating eczema/EpiPen/night sweats were not discussed; stating Jessica didn’t answer asthma; referencing a “knowledge graph provided” (not in the source); and adding interpretive statements (e.g., ‘adult’) not supported by the transcript. While some quotes are real (allergy timing, cough/headache/hot), the answer contains several clear hallucinations/denials of documented content.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to answer what conditions were screened for and what Jessica said, but it omits most of the targeted screening actually performed and substitutes an incomplete/incorrect subset. Some extra differential-diagnosis commentary is tangential, but still related. Overall only partially addresses the specific question."
