  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (worsening cough with citations [P-1, P-5], sputum changes [P-6], increased dyspnea [P-1, P-5, P-8]) matching the Gold Answer. The doctor's linking quote from [D-52] is faithfully reproduced. Minor discrepancies: COPD history cited as 'a couple years ago' [P-1] instead of approximately five years [P-2] as in Gold; sputum described as 'clear to yellow' becoming 'more yellow' vs. Gold's 'clear-to-white to yellow'; omits mention of inhalers [P-11]. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: worsening cough [P-1,P-5], sputum changes [P-6], increased dyspnea [P-8], COPD history, doctor's synthesis [D-52]. Missed: exact COPD duration (five years [P-2]), inhalers (Ventolin/Spiriva [P-11]). Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom claims and citations ([P-1,P-5,P-6,P-8,D-52]) are directly verifiable in transcript. Doctor's quote accurate. Hallucinations: References to non-existent 'knowledge graph' and its associations (e.g., [SYMPTOM] cough --[ASSOCIATED_WITH]--> [DIAGNOSIS] copd exacerbation), which are not in transcript. Minor sputum phrasing inaccuracy. Multiple unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing the exact symptoms (worsening cough, sputum changes, increased dyspnea) with COPD history and quoting doctor's linkage in [D-52]. Knowledge graph addition is a minor tangent but does not detract from focus."
