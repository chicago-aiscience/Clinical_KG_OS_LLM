  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses Tylenol (occasional for headaches, per Gold [P-27]), lists only two meds vs. Gold's three; incorrectly claims no specific historical adherence changes despite Gold and transcript detailing skipping evening daily inhaler dose for 'a while' [P-19], now only morning [P-19/P-20], and no rescue refill for couple years [P-17/P-18]; simplifies salbutamol as 'daily' without dosing details or rescue distinction, contradicting Gold's core facts on adherence evolution.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: meds/conditions (salbutamol asthma [P-25], Ramipril HBP [P-24/P-26], Tylenol headaches [P-27]) - covers Ramipril and salbutamol (67%); adherence changes (BID prescribed but skipping PM 'for a while' now only AM [P-19/P-20], no rescue couple years/none available [P-17/P-18], not stopped recently [P-19], limiting meds [D-34], two gaps) - covers none, denies existence (~0%); overall 20-49% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Grounded claims: Ramipril HBP [P-26], salbutamol mentioned [P-25] verifiable; ungrounded: 'knowledge graph' (absent), 'no specific information' on adherence changes (falsely denies P-17-P-20 details on dosing skips, rescue absence over years), implies only current daily without PM skip or rescue history; multiple hallucinations of data absence.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around meds/conditions and adherence changes per question, but partially evades adherence history by claiming lack of info instead of extracting from transcript; no major off-topic content, remains focused on query elements."
