  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes husband's preceding week-long illness suggesting household transmission, limited outside contacts (work from home, staying home, hiking only, no other sick contacts) supporting household over independent acquisition, and no flu shot making influenza viable alongside COVID symptoms, with COVID prioritized. Generated Answer correctly identifies husband as prioritizing COVID (core fact) and no flu shot elevating influenza (core), but introduces factual errors: 'simultaneous onset' contradicts preceding timeline (husband 1 week vs patient 3 days), and 'Knowledge Graph Connections' are entirely absent from Gold and transcript. Minor discrepancy in emphasis on limited contacts. Main points correct despite errors: 3.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Husband's week-long preceding symptoms [P-19/20], household transmission [D-51/53]; 2) Limited contacts - work from home [P-23/42], staying home [P-22], hiking only [P-18], no other sick contacts [P-17], supports household tx; 3) No flu shot [P-53/D-53], fits both dx. Generated covers husband fully, no flu shot fully, limited contacts partially (hiking/no travel [P-18], implies household but omits work home/staying/no other contacts explicitly). Covers ~70% of key points: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like husband prioritizing COVID [D-53], no flu shot [D-53/P-53/D-54], hiking [P-18] verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, 'Knowledge Graph Connection' entries (e.g., [MEDICAL_HISTORY] husband... --> [DIAGNOSIS] covid-19) fully hallucinated/not in transcript; 'simultaneous onset' contradicts timeline (P-19 week vs P-1 3 days); 'exclusionary diagnosis' plausible but not verbatim. Multiple hallucinated elements: 2.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the question's specified factors (husband, household/limited contact, no flu shot) and their impact on COVID vs influenza differential, with transcript ties and prioritization explanation. Knowledge Graph tangents minor; perfectly focused overall: 5."
