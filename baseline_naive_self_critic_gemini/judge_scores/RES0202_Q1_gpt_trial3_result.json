  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the mother-reported dry cough, fever (over 100°F, ~100.1–101), and fatigue/tiredness. However, it contains major factual errors compared with the Gold Answer/transcript: it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain explicit denials for chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills, and GI complaints. In fact, the mother clearly denies these: chest pain/heart racing (P-13: “No”), sore throat (P-14: “I don’t think so”), chills/night sweats (P-19: “No”), diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool (P-22: “No”), and nausea/vomiting (P-23: “No”). It also introduces an unsupported ‘knowledge graph’ asthma linkage; while asthma is mentioned later by the doctor as a consideration (D-45), the “knowledge graph link” phrasing and implication is not in the transcript and is extraneous.",
    "completeness": "Key positives from the Gold Answer that are missing: decreased appetite (P-15), possible loss of taste (P-17), mild runny nose (P-16), and the nuance that shortness of breath was uncertain (P-8). Key explicitly denied/negative symptoms missing: no sputum or blood (P-6), no wheeze (P-7), no rash/skin-hair-nail changes (P-20), no urinary changes (P-24), no dizziness/fainting (P-25), no confusion/memory loss (P-26), vision/hearing fine (P-18), and the note that swallowing difficulty was uncertain rather than denied (P-15). The answer includes only a subset of the asked-about/denied symptoms and mischaracterizes several denials as absent.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not faithful to the transcript: stating there were no explicit denials for chest pain, sore throat, chills, and GI symptoms contradicts multiple explicit denials in the transcript (P-13, P-14, P-19, P-22, P-23). The ‘knowledge graph’ asthma linkage is not present in the transcript (hallucinated framing) and adds unsupported content. Other included items (cough, fever, fatigue, possible harder breathing) are grounded, but overall there are multiple ungrounded/incorrect assertions.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (respiratory/systemic symptoms reported; symptoms asked about and denied). However, it includes an irrelevant ‘knowledge graph’/asthma linkage and, more importantly, fails to correctly list the denied symptoms that the question explicitly asks for, reducing its practical relevance."
