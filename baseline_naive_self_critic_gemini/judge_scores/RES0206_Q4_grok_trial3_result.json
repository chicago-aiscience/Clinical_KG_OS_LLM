  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the condition to rule out as COVID and the test as a COVID swab, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-43]. However, it makes a significant factual error by claiming the transcript lacks any information on the patient's recent social contacts or exposure history, directly contradicting [P-20] where the patient describes meeting friends for dog walks outside, one being sick, and sometimes walking too close. This misrepresents a core prompting factor highlighted in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) condition = COVID-19; (2) test = COVID swab [D-43]; (3) prompting social details = dog-walking friends, one sick, too close despite outdoors, unsure of friend's COVID test [P-20, P-21]. Generated covers (1) and (2) fully but entirely misses (3), falsely stating no such info exists; covers ~33% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Condition and test claims are verifiable in [D-43]. However, the claim of no social contacts/exposure info in transcript is not grounded and hallucinates an absence, as [D-20] explicitly asks about sick exposures and [P-20] provides details on sick friend during dog walks. Doctor's follow-up on friend's COVID test [D-21/P-21] ties directly to COVID consideration. Multiple inaccuracies in overlooking transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the three-part question (condition, test, social details) with numbered points and stays focused without tangents or off-topic content."
