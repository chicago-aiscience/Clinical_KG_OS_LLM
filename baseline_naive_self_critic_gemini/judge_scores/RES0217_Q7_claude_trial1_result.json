  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the Friday hiking, Saturday gardening, same-day discovery, the 72-hour estimation, the 10-year prior episode, the bullseye rash history, the comparison of engorgement ('quite swollen' vs 'pretty small'), and the contrast in local symptoms (bullseye vs localized redness). All facts align with the transcript citations.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: the timeline (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, discovery/presentation same day, 72-hour estimate), uncertainty about attachment timing, the plastic container detail, the prior episode (~10 years ago), engorgement comparison ('quite swollen' vs 'maybe a little bit'), and symptom comparison (bullseye rash vs localized redness without larger circle rash). The structure is organized and comprehensive.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1], [P-3], [P-4], [P-6], [D-6]. No hallucinated information is present. The answer correctly cites patient statements about hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, discovering the tick 'earlier today,' the 10-year prior episode, engorgement comparisons, and symptom differences. The 72-hour timeline is mentioned in the context but could have been explicitly cited to D-6.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the complex question: the timeline from Friday hiking through Saturday gardening to discovery and doctor presentation, and the detailed comparison of current vs. prior episode regarding local symptoms and tick engorgement. No irrelevant information is included. The answer is well-structured with clear headings that map to the question's components."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an exemplary response that is factually accurate, comprehensive, and fully grounded in the transcript. It systematically addresses both parts of the complex question: the timeline of tick exposure (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening, same-day discovery and presentation) and the detailed comparison between current and prior episodes (engorgement: 'quite swollen' vs 'pretty small'; symptoms: bullseye rash with antibiotics vs localized redness/tenderness). All claims are verifiable with appropriate citations, and the organized structure enhances clarity without adding irrelevant content."
