  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s diagnosis (asthma, specifically exercise-induced bronchoconstriction) matches the Gold Answer’s conclusion (pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in an atopic context). The supporting findings it cites—exercise trigger [P-3], cold worsening [P-38], improvement with rest [P-6], and seasonal allergies [P-35]—are all consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. No contradictory or clearly incorrect claims are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: \n- Exercise-triggered episodes (tag/outdoor running) [P-3] (partially; does not also cite backyard running [P-41])\n- Episodic/reversible with rest [P-6]\n- Worse in cold weather [P-38]\n- Atopic tendency via seasonal allergies [P-35]\n- Wheeze/SOB/cough/difficulty deep breath (supportive features) [P-1, P-2]\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed:\n- Occurs across multiple settings [P-38] and at home [P-40] (the question explicitly asks for this support)\n- Nocturnal wheezy episode/trouble falling asleep [P-43, P-44]\n- Pertinent negatives arguing against infection (no fever [P-7], no runny nose [P-8], no sick contacts [P-10], no phlegm [P-31])\n- OTC antihistamine use [P-36] supporting atopy (mentioned in Gold but not in Generated Answer)\n\nOverall, it captures the main diagnostic rationale but omits several transcript-supported features emphasized in the Gold Answer and requested by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript and appropriately cited (exercise trigger [P-3], cold worsening [P-38], rest relief [P-6], seasonal allergies [P-35], wheeze/SOB/cough/deep breath difficulty [P-1, P-2]). It does not add unsupported risk factors or exam findings. Minor limitation: it does not address (rather than misstates) the “multiple settings” element, but that is an omission rather than a hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by naming the most likely respiratory diagnosis and providing transcript findings that support that conclusion. It stays on-topic without extraneous discussion."
