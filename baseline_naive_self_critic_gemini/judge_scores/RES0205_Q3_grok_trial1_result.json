  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately states the negative result, matching the Gold Answer. It covers key evidence like hospital work, persistent cough, initial flu-like symptoms, and workplace concerns. Minor discrepancy: attributes some prompting to the doctor's questions during the consult (e.g., fever, breathing), but the Gold Answer and transcript indicate the test was already performed by the patient prior to this visit (P-35, P-36), not prompted by this exam. Core facts remain consistent without errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnosis (COVID-19), patient disclosure of test (P-35), hospital work (P-17/P-34), initial flu-like symptoms resolving but persistent cough (P-14), coworkers scared/anxiety at work (P-35), PPE use (P-17), negative result. Missed or partially covered: specific citations for sore throat/runny nose (P-13/P-14), exact test timing at symptom onset two weeks prior (P-36), and patient staying home since test (P-36). Covers approximately 85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: persistence and flu-like symptoms (P-14, P-35), hospital work and PPE (P-17), workplace fear (P-35), doctor's symptom questions (D-11-D-13, D-19-D-20), negative COVID test (P-35). No hallucinations; inferences like 'fearing spread' are grounded in P-35. Citations are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly structures its response around the question's elements—diagnosis, evidence prompting investigation, and testing results—with clear headings and focused content, containing no off-topic information."
