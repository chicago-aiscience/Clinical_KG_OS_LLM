    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer states missed Keppra dose directly connected to seizure same night due to disrupted routine [P-8, P-24]; patient recognized in P-9 ('I kind of forgot... I think that might have yeah'), voluntary after D-9, rare seizures, one-time lapse [P-24], no clinician confirmation. Generated correctly notes missed Keppra [P-23] as precipitating factor for seizure and patient's recognition in P-9 with partial quote. However, introduces non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' and diagrammatic causal link not in Gold or transcript, slightly inaccurate P-9 quote trail-off. Core facts match, but extraneous fabrication; minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: (1) direct connection via same-night missed Keppra due to dinner disruption/bday [P-8,P-24]; (2) P-9 spontaneous attribution post D-9; (3) rare seizures usually [P-9]; (4) one-time lapse details [P-24]; (5) patient's own recognition, no clinician view. Generated covers: (1) missed dose precipitates seizure; (2) P-9 recognition; mentions Keppra [P-23]. Misses timing/routine/bday details, rarity, response context, no clinician note. Covers core connection and main P-9 evidence (~60%), but incomplete on supporting nuances.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verification: Keppra [P-23] accurate; forgot med [P-9,P-24] accurate; P-9 quote mostly accurate ('I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have...' matches). Patient realization grounded. However, 'Knowledge Graph [RISK_FACTOR] forgot medication --[PRECIPITATES]--> [SYMPTOM] seizure' entirely hallucinated—not in transcript. Citations accurate where used, but added unverifiable causal diagram presented as sourced; some hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response with 'Connection to the Seizure' and 'Patient’s Realization' sections directly mirroring question's two parts (causal connection + patient evidence). Quotes transcript, stays on-topic, no tangents—perfectly addresses question."
