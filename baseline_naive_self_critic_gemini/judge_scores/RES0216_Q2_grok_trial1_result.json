  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Ramipril for high blood pressure and salbutamol for asthma, matching parts of the Gold Answer and transcript (P-24-P-27). However, it omits Tylenol for headaches entirely, a key medication listed in the Gold. Critically, it inaccurately claims the transcript lacks details on adherence changes over the past couple of years (e.g., skipping evening dose 'for a while' [P-19], no rescue inhaler refill in 'a couple of years' [P-17-P-18]), directly contradicting the Gold Answer's detailed summary of these changes and transcript evidence. It also mischaracterizes salbutamol as simply 'daily' without noting the reduced frequency or distinction from rescue. Significant factual errors and contradictions warrant a score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: three medications (salbutamol/asthma, Ramipril/HBP, Tylenol/headaches); daily inhaler prescribed BID but reduced to morning only 'for a while' with no issues; no rescue refill in couple years, currently unavailable; recent confirmation of continued use; clinician summary of limiting meds. Generated covers Ramipril/HBP and salbutamol/asthma (partial), but misses Tylenol entirely and all adherence change details (dosing reduction, rescue history, justifications). Covers ~25% of key points (2 partial meds out of 3 + none of adherence), score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like 'provided clinical documentation does not contain specific information regarding... adherence... over the past couple of years' are unverifiable and false per transcript (P-17-P-20 explicitly detail changes: skipping night dose 'for a while', no rescue needed 'couple of years'). References to non-existent 'knowledge graph' for salbutamol as 'daily' introduce potential hallucination (transcript distinguishes daily maintenance vs. as-needed rescue, names salbutamol as daily). Doctor's [D-35] reoccurrence note is cited but downplayed, ignoring patient history. Multiple ungrounded denials of transcript content, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around medications/conditions and adherence changes as asked, but partially evades the core adherence history by claiming lack of info, with some off-topic references to 'knowledge graph' and vague clinician implication. Mostly on-topic but incomplete in addressing historical changes, score 3."
