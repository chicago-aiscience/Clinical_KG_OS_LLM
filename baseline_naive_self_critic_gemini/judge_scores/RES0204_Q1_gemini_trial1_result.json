{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the symptoms (cough and runny nose), their durations, the dry/non-productive nature of the cough, and the clear appearance of the nasal discharge, which are all consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the primary symptoms and their specific characteristics but omits several secondary points found in the Gold Answer, such as the patient's comparison to previous illnesses (past runny noses not lasting this long) and several pertinent negatives (denial of chest pain, wheezing, and shortness of breath).",
    "faithfulness": "The clinical facts are well-grounded in the transcript. However, the Generated Answer references a 'knowledge graph' and uses structured tagging logic (e.g., [SUBTYPE]) that was not part of the provided context, which constitutes a minor hallucination regarding the source materials.",
    "relevance": "The response directly and clearly addresses the specific components of the question, including symptom nature and discharge appearance."
