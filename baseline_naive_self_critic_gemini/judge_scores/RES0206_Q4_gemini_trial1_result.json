  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition to rule out (COVID-19) and the test ordered (COVID swab). However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain information about social contacts, which is a significant factual error as the patient explicitly mentions walking dogs with a sick friend in [P-20].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers two out of the three specific components requested in the prompt. It fails to provide the detail about social contacts that prompted the diagnosis, which is a major part of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucination of omission. It claims the transcript lacks specific information regarding social contacts or exposure history, despite the transcript clearly providing this at [P-20] and [P-21].",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to directly address the three parts of the question, but the third section is irrelevant in substance because it denies the existence of the source text's content."
