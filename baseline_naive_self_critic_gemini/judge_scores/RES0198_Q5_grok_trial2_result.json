  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies the nephew attending daycare (P-11) as the key potential infectious exposure source from social history, noting daycare as a common source of respiratory viruses despite the nephew not being sick (P-12), and links it to the viral URI assessment (D-39); the Generated Answer misses this entirely, incorrectly stating no explicit exposure source and attributing isolation/swab primarily to pandemic context without mentioning the nephew or daycare, while also mislinking diabetes to the care plan (Gold notes no explicit doctor link to immune risk). This introduces significant factual contradictions and errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: nephew/daycare exposure (P-11), plausibility despite not sick (P-12), diabetes details (P-23-P-26), no explicit doctor link to immune function, symptoms persisting a week. Generated covers diabetes (P-23) and viral diagnosis (D-39) partially (~30%), but misses core exposure source and accurate relation entirely.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites transcript accurately for diabetes (P-23) and diagnosis/isolation (D-39), but hallucinates that diabetes is 'factored into the care plan by necessitating isolation' and 'to minimize infection risk,' which is not in transcript (isolation due to pandemic/COVID concern, diabetes mentioned separately without link); also unexplained '[KG]' appears fabricated.",
    "relevance": "Generated addresses symptoms, viral diagnosis, diabetes, and pandemic precautions but fails to identify the specific social history exposure source (nephew/daycare), making it only partially relevant with off-topic emphasis on general pandemic isolation over the question's focus."
