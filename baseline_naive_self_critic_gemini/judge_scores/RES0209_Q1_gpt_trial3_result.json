  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several core symptoms from the transcript: a dry, near-continuous daytime cough (P-1), shortness of breath/difficulty breathing (P-1, P-19), and frequent wheezing (P-15). However, it contains two clear factual errors relative to the Gold Answer and transcript: (1) it claims the patient did not explicitly confirm chest tightness, but the patient did confirm this (“Yes” to chest tightness, P-20); and (2) it claims the patient did not provide a specific nighttime frequency, but the patient did (“every other day” / “every two days,” P-18). It also omits the cough duration (~2 weeks, P-13) and the point that wheezing episodes were more frequent than bronchodilator use (D-17, P-17).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: dry cough character and near-constant daytime nature; shortness of breath/hard time breathing; wheezing; general day>night pattern. Key elements missed/incorrect: cough duration (~2 weeks); explicit nonproductive confirmation context (“bringing up gunk”); wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use; chest tightness (explicitly present but denied in GA); specific nighttime frequency (every other day/every two days) (explicitly present but denied in GA). Overall, the answer captures roughly half to two-thirds of required details but misses/contradicts several key specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "Most included statements are grounded in the transcript (dry cough, SOB, wheeze, day vs night pattern; triggers like cold/pollen are also mentioned). However, the answer makes multiple claims that conflict with the transcript: it states chest tightness was not confirmed (but it was, P-20) and that no specific nighttime frequency was given (but it was, P-18). These are not just omissions; they are unfaithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested symptom types (cough character, breathing difficulty, wheeze, chest sensations) and daytime vs nighttime frequency, with only minor extra context (triggers)."
