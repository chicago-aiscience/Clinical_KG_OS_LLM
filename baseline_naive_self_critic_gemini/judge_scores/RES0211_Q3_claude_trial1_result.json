  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the key symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, subjective fever, headache, malaise), the timeline (3-4 days), and the absence of sputum, GI symptoms, and joint pain. The citation references are accurate. The explanation of how these findings support a URI diagnosis aligns with the Gold Answer's reasoning.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: (1) symptom constellation (scratchy throat, dry cough, fever, headache, malaise, fatigue), (2) timeline (3-4 days), (3) non-productive cough without sputum/phlegm, (4) absence of GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), (5) absence of joint pain, and (6) the doctor's summary. However, it omits the brother's recent cold as a plausible viral exposure source [P-39], which was mentioned in the Gold Answer as supporting evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. All claims are verifiable: dry cough [P-1], scratchy throat [P-1], headache [P-1, P-2], feeling hot [P-7, P-9], absence of sputum [P-5, P-6], absence of GI symptoms [P-11, P-12], absence of joint pain [P-13], and doctor's summary [D-58]. There are no hallucinated facts. The reference to 'knowledge graph' is not from the transcript but appears to be an artifact from the answer generation process rather than fabricated clinical content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by explaining how the presenting symptoms and absent symptoms support the URI diagnosis. It is well-organized into logical sections that systematically answer each component of the question. The structure (presence of upper respiratory symptoms, constitutional symptoms, exclusion of lower respiratory involvement, differentiation from systemic infections) is highly relevant and focused."
