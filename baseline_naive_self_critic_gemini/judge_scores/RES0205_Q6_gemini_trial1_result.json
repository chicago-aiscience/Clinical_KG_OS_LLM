  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect. It claims the transcript ends at [P-35] and that no plan or physical exam components were mentioned. However, the transcript clearly contains turn [D-37], which explicitly states the plan to listen to the heart and lungs, perform a physical exam, and consult with a supervising physician before returning to discuss next steps.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific physical exam components (heart and lungs), the collaborative process with the supervisor, and the overall plan for the next steps.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the provided source. It falsely claims the transcript ends early ('ends abruptly with the Patient [P-35]') and misses the final three turns of the dialogue which contain the answer.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question, providing a negative response based on an incorrect assessment of the available text."
