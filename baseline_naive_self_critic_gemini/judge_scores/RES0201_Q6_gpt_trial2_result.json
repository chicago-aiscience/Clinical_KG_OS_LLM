  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the clinician’s assessment that the patient’s symptoms are consistent with common COVID-19 symptoms and therefore warrant COVID swab testing (matches D-43). It correctly identifies the two diagnostic tests discussed: a COVID swab and a chest X-ray (D-43). It also correctly captures the isolation instructions: isolate until results return, and continue isolation even with a negative test if symptoms persist (D-43). Minor overstatement: it says the swab will “confirm the diagnosis” and that the doctor “ordered” a chest X-ray, whereas the transcript frames both as “probably” (planned/anticipated) rather than definitively ordered.",
    "completeness": "Key elements from the Gold Answer are largely covered: (1) assessment of COVID-like symptoms, (2) COVID swab, (3) chest X-ray, (4) isolate until results, and (5) continue isolation if still symptomatic even if negative. It omits the contextual rationale (difficulty breathing/COPD relevance) and the note that the clinician would consult with the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps (D-1, D-44).",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are grounded in D-43. The only minor faithfulness concern is the shift from tentative language (“probably”) to definitive language (“will administer,” “ordered,” “confirm”), which slightly exceeds what is explicitly stated, but does not introduce new tests or instructions not present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested items: overall assessment, the specific diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, and the condition for continued isolation after results. No meaningful irrelevant content."
