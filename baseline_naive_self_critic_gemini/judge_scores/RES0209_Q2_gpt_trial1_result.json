  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient uses a bronchodilator, but it makes two major factual errors compared with the Gold Answer and transcript: (1) it incorrectly states the transcript does not specify how it is administered, despite explicit discussion that it is a \"puffer\" (inhaler) (D-7, P-7); and (2) it incorrectly states the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication, despite the doctor asking about a medication taken \"every day no matter what\" (D-5) and the patient denying having one (P-5). It also fails to clearly state the bronchodilator is used 'as needed' (though implied).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: bronchodilator is used; increased reliance mentioned.\nKey points missed/incorrect: route of administration as puffer/inhaler; explicit 'as-needed' use; explicit denial of other medications; explicit clinician question about daily controller/maintenance medication and patient lacking it. Overall, it captures less than half of the required elements and directly contradicts others.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not faithful to the transcript: stating administration is not specified contradicts D-7/P-7; stating there is no segment about daily controller contradicts D-5/P-5/D-6. It cites P-1 as evidence the bronchodilator is the sole medication, but P-1 does not establish it is the only medication (that is established later at D-6/P-6 and D-30/P-30). Mention of a 'knowledge graph' is unsupported.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address all parts of the question (current medication, administration, and missing daily controller), and stays on-topic. However, the content is incorrect for key parts."
