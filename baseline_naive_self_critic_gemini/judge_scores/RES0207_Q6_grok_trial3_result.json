  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer accurately cites D-37 and D-38 where doctor communicates next steps (discuss with another doctor, return shortly to talk about tests and moving forward). Generated Answer incorrectly claims no next steps were communicated, misidentifies end of transcript at P-26/D-22 (midway), and states consultation ends abruptly while patient speaking (false, ends at D-38). This is a complete contradiction of facts in Gold Answer and transcript. Score: 1.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: Doctor will review info with 'doctor working today' (D-37), collaborative decision-making, return shortly to discuss next steps/tests/management (D-37/D-38), no specific tests ordered, patient agreement (P-37). Generated covers 0% of these, instead falsely denying any communication. Score: 1.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims transcript ends at P-26 (family history) with no further doctor turns, but transcript continues through D-38 with explicit next steps. Citations [P-26]/[D-22] incorrect for end; hallucinates abrupt end 'while patient speaking'. No claims verifiable; entirely ungrounded. Score: 1.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses question by stating no next steps/decision-makers/follow-ups were communicated, with no irrelevant tangents, though factually wrong. Perfectly focused on query. Score: 5."
