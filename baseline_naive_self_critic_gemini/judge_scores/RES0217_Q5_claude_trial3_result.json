  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key factual elements from the transcript. It correctly identifies the Friday hiking and Saturday gardening timeline, the >72 hour attachment calculation, the Strathroy location, and the doctor's use of the distribution map to justify prophylactic treatment. All major facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all essential points from the Gold Answer: (1) the Friday/Saturday timeline with uncertainty about when the tick attached, (2) the doctor's >72 hour calculation, (3) the prophylactic antibiotic decision based on duration, (4) the Strathroy location specification, (5) the doctor's consultation of the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, and (6) the geographic risk assessment leading to antibiotic treatment. Minor details like the patient's quote 'I don't really know when I got it' and 'earlier today' are omitted but the core content is complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The timeline details [P-1], the >72 hour calculation [D-6], the Strathroy location [P-12], and the map consultation with geographic risk assessment [D-13] are all grounded in the source material. The mention of a 'knowledge graph' appears to be an artifact from the answering system but doesn't constitute hallucination of clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) how the Friday/Saturday activities contributed to >72 hour attachment duration, and (2) how the doctor used Strathroy's position on the distribution map to justify prophylactic treatment. All content is focused on answering these specific aspects with no tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and highly relevant response that directly addresses both components of the question. It correctly explains the timeline calculation leading to >72 hour attachment duration and accurately describes how the doctor used the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map to assess Strathroy as a concerning point, justifying prophylactic antibiotic treatment. All claims are faithfully grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. The answer covers nearly all key points from the Gold Answer, with only minor direct quotes omitted that don't affect the substantive completeness of the response."
