  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims the doctor “did not systematically explore” exposure sources and that there is “no evidence” the doctor asked about living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts. This directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer. In the transcript, the doctor explicitly asked: where the patient lives (apartment, alone) [P-45]; environmental exposures (old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets) [D-46]/[P-46]; contact with anyone sick [D-47]/[P-47]; workplace location (car dealership) [P-48] and whether anyone at work was sick [D-50]/[P-50]; and recent travel [D-49]/[P-49]. Therefore, the central factual claim of the Generated Answer is incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include: (1) living situation (apartment in city, alone), (2) home/environmental triggers (carpets/dust/mold/asbestos/pets), (3) sick contacts (asked; possible lunchroom contact), (4) workplace (car dealership; asked if coworkers sick), (5) travel (asked; denied), and (6) substance use screening. The Generated Answer includes none of these explored sources; it instead incorrectly states they were not asked. Coverage of Gold Answer key points is essentially 0%.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not grounded in the provided transcript: it states there is no evidence of questions about living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts, but the transcript contains explicit questions and answers on all these topics ([P-45]–[P-50], [D-49], [D-50]). This is a contradiction of the source rather than a minor unverifiable detail. No major new fabricated events are added, but the core assertions conflict with the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the question topic (whether/what exposure sources were explored) and does not include major tangents. However, it answers by denying that the exploration occurred rather than listing the sources as asked. Topically relevant but substantively misaligned."
