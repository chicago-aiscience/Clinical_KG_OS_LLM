  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient's report of grandkids visiting last weekend with grandson having a cold and attending daycare [P-23], and links it to the doctor's suspicion of infection/COVID [D-36], consistent with Gold. However, it incorrectly states the doctor did NOT explore other exposure pathways like travel or in-person client visits, directly contradicting the transcript [D-24, D-32, P-24, P-32] and Gold Answer. It also hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph' not present. Significant factual errors on key exclusions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: grandson exposure details [P-23] and link to assessment [D-36]. Missed: symptom onset timing relative to visit [P-1], doctor's acknowledgment [D-24], specific exclusion of travel [D-24,P-24], occupational exposures with timing [P-31,D-32,P-32], and conclusion on grandson as primary source. Covers ~30-40% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about grandson exposure verifiable [P-23]. But assertion that doctor did not explore travel or client visits is false [D-24,D-32]; transcript shows direct questions and denials. 'Knowledge Graph' reference is hallucinated, not in transcript. Multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Addresses first part of question (grandson connection to assessment) directly. Second part (other pathways explored/excluded) is addressed but incorrectly, claiming no exploration instead of detailing exclusions; some off-topic elements like KG."
