  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s plan in [D-52]: diagnosis of COPD exacerbation; labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG); chest X-ray; COVID swab; oxygen saturation measurement with supplemental oxygen as needed; continue bronchodilators; start steroids and antibiotics. No statements directly contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers nearly all key components from the Gold Answer (labs, imaging, O2 sat monitoring, oxygen PRN, bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, COVID swab). Missing: (1) the expected COVID swab turnaround time (24–48 hours) mentioned in Gold Answer; (2) the additional monitoring point noted in Gold Answer from [D-37] about ongoing blood pressure monitoring due to self-discontinued antihypertensive/kidney complication concern.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all items are explicitly supported by [D-52]. The only mild overreach is labeling monitoring as “Vital Signs” rather than specifically oxygen saturation; the transcript only specifies oxygen saturation measurement. Otherwise, no clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing laboratory tests, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions for the COPD exacerbation; minimal extraneous content."
