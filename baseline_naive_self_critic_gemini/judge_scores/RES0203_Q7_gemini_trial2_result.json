  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the content of the transcript. It incorrectly claims that the text does not provide information about symptom progression (worsening or fluctuation) and previous experiences. However, the transcript explicitly states the symptoms were 'consistent' (P-5, P-8) and that the patient had 'nothing like this' before (P-3).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two out of the three main components of the Gold Answer. While it covers the timing and concurrency of symptoms, it fails to mention that the symptoms remained consistent/did not worsen and that the patient had no prior history of these symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails to ground its claims in the provided text. By asserting that information is missing when it is clearly present in the transcript (D-3, P-3, D-5, P-5, D-8, P-8), it provides an unfaithful representation of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly attempting to answer all parts of the user's multi-part question. However, the relevance of the content itself is undermined by the factual omissions."
