  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s recommendations in the transcript and matches the Gold Answer on the major management measures: COVID swab with 24–48h turnaround, 14-day isolation, isolate from younger sister, and ER/return precautions (high fever; neurologic symptoms including seizures; weakness/dizziness; fainting). No incorrect or contradictory statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) COVID swab and 24–48h results, (2) isolate for 14 days, (3) isolate from younger sister, (4) ER precautions for high temp/neurologic symptoms/weakness-dizziness/fainting. \nKey Gold Answer points missed: (a) mention of possible false negatives, (b) possibility of another viral illness if swab negative, (c) explicitly noting supportive/observational approach and no medications, (d) school requiring a COVID test for return. Overall coverage is strong but not total.",
    "faithfulness": "All included elements are directly supported by D-44 (test timing, isolation duration, isolate from younger sister, and ER precautions). No notable hallucinations or claims beyond the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested management measures (tests, isolation instructions/duration, and who to isolate from) and appropriately adds the doctor’s escalation/ER criteria, which are part of management. No irrelevant tangents."
