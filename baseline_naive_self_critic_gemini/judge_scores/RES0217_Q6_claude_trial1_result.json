  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all major components of the clinical plan. It accurately describes the physical exam, tick laboratory testing, blood work for Lyme serology, prophylactic antibiotics, physician consultation, and environmental advice including insecticide use and surveillance. All facts align with the Gold Answer and source transcript. The citation references are appropriate and support each claim.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key elements present in the Gold Answer: (1) three diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick species identification, blood work for Lyme titres/serology), (2) prophylactic antibiotic treatment with rationale (>72 hours attachment and geographic risk), (3) planned physician consultation indicating supervised encounter, and (4) comprehensive preventive advice about ticks in long grass at woods-field intersections, waving motion, and insecticide use. The only minor omission is the specific detail that the tick was in a 'plastic container,' but this is trivial context rather than a key clinical plan element.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript. The physical exam mention [D-18], tick laboratory identification [D-6, D-18], blood work for serology [D-18], antibiotic plan [D-6, D-18], physician consultation [D-13, D-18, D-22], and environmental advice about long grass, woods-field intersections, waving motion, and insecticide [D-18] are all explicitly stated. The citations are accurate and no hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about the doctor's comprehensive clinical plan. It is well-organized into the exact categories requested: diagnostic tests (laboratory and physical), treatments, physician consultation, and preventive environmental advice. There is no irrelevant content or tangential information."
