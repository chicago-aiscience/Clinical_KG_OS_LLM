  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies both key risk factors: medication non-adherence (forgot to take Keppra) and hereditary predisposition (mother had epilepsy). The citations to P-9 and P-26 are accurate. The facts align with the Gold Answer's identification of these same two factors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main elements but lacks important details present in the Gold Answer: (1) it doesn't name the specific medication (Keppra) mentioned in P-23, (2) it omits the contextual detail about the daughter's birthday disrupting the medication routine from P-24, (3) it doesn't mention that seizures are normally infrequent when medication is taken regularly, and (4) it provides less explanation of how the hereditary factor establishes genetic predisposition consistent with the chronic epilepsy diagnosis. The answer covers approximately 70% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations to P-9 and P-26 are accurate. However, the reference to a 'knowledge graph' is unexplained and not present in the source materials provided, which introduces an element that cannot be verified from the transcript alone. This is a minor concern but suggests some external information source that wasn't part of the evaluation materials.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) identifying hereditary and medication-related risk factors for the seizure, and (2) explaining how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. The structure is clear and focused, with no irrelevant content. The answer stays on topic throughout."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies both major risk factors (medication non-adherence and hereditary predisposition) with accurate citations. It directly addresses the question with good relevance and factual accuracy. However, it lacks important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including the specific medication name (Keppra), the birthday celebration context for the missed dose, and the note about normally infrequent seizures. The unexplained reference to a 'knowledge graph' raises minor concerns about faithfulness to the source transcript. Overall, this is a solid answer that captures the core facts but could be more complete."
