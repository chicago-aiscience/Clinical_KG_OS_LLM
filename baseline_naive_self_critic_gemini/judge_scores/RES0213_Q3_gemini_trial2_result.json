  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer suggests a diagnosis of 'Angina Pectoris', which is technically a clinical term for chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart (ischemia), making it an inappropriate primary term for anxiety-induced pain. It also incorrectly states that the patient confirms current symptoms feel similar to previous anxiety attacks; in the transcript (P-20), the patient is actually stating that palpitations occurred during past attacks but are absent now. The Gold Answer more accurately focuses on 'anxiety-related' or 'stress-induced' pain.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The 'pertinent negatives' (absence of fever, asthma, and exertional worsening) which are crucial for ruling out cardiac/pulmonary pathology. 2) The specific observation from the prompt and Gold Answer regarding the resolution of pain when the patient is distracted or engaged with others (P-9, P-29).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, but it misinterprets P-20 and P-22. The patient notes she feels she 'could maybe' get attacks again, but does not explicitly state the current sharp chest pain is identical to the symptoms of her teenage attacks (she specifically links her past attacks to heart fluttering, which she denies having now).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question, providing a diagnosis and supporting clinical observations, although some observations are slightly misinterpreted or incomplete."
