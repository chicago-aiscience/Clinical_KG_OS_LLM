  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate concerning the specific lines of inquiry it chose to highlight (dyspnea and anxiety). However, it frames the screening of 'anxiety attacks' as being ruled out as a condition, whereas the transcript shows the patient suggests they might be returning. In contrast, the Gold Answer focuses on clinical diagnoses like angina and arrhythmia. The generated answer accurately identifies the doctor's inquiry regarding shortness of breath.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is highly incomplete. It misses five out of the six major categories identified in the Gold Answer: traumatic/musculoskeletal injury, cardiac disease/exertional angina, infectious/febrile illness, asthma, and inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. It only captures approximately 16% of the clinical screenings detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript, providing accurate citations (e.g., D-19, P-19, D-21, P-20) for the points it discusses. There are no hallucinations, though the scope is limited.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant to the prompt as it addresses conditions screened and the lines of inquiry used. However, by omitting the vast majority of the medical screening, its utility is significantly diminished."
