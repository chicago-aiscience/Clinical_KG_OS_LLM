  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the dry cough (progressive), fever (over 100°F), and fatigue as reported by the mother, matching Gold. However, it misrepresents shortness of breath as a reported symptom ('harder time breathing'), while Gold notes it as uncertain ('maybe... but just tired' [P-8]). It omits key reported symptoms: decreased appetite [P-15], possible loss of taste [P-17], mild runny nose [P-16]. For denied symptoms, it lists some asked (chest pain, sore throat, chills, GI) but incorrectly claims 'no explicit patient denials (e.g., verbal \"No\")', contradicting Gold's list of explicit denials (e.g., sputum/blood [P-6 'No'], wheezing [P-7 'No'], chest pain/heart racing [P-13 'No'], sore throat [P-14 'Mm I don't think so'], chills/night sweats [P-19 'No'], GI [P-22 'No'], etc.). Adds hallucinated 'knowledge graph link' to asthma, not in Gold or transcript. Significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Reported - dry cough worsening 3 days, fever Friday 100+, fatigue, dec appetite, poss loss taste, mild runny nose, SOB uncertain; Denied - sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, skin changes, GI (diarrhea/const/blood), N/V, urine changes, dizziness/fainting, confusion/memory, vision/hearing fine, swallowing uncertain. Generated covers cough, fever, fatigue (~30%); wrongly includes SOB as positive; omits runny nose, appetite, taste, SOB nuance, most/all denied symptoms (lists asked but not as denied). Covers 20-49% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded with citations (e.g., cough [P-1,5,12 via P-1], fever [P-1,2], fatigue [P-1,8,25 via P-1,8]). However, hallucinates 'knowledge graph link' and asthma correlation (transcript mentions asthma possibility [D-45] but no graph/link); overstates SOB as reported vs. mother's speculation [P-8]; falsely claims no explicit denials despite multiple 'No' (P-6,7,13,19,22,23,25,26) and equivalents. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and doctor-asked symptoms, addressing the question's two parts. Minor tangent with irrelevant knowledge graph/asthma; partially misses 'denied' aspect by listing asked but denying denials. Mostly relevant, no major off-topic content."
