  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer lists multiple ROS symptoms that were explicitly asked and denied (runny nose/congestion, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling). The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript contains no explicit instances of the doctor asking about or the patient denying chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea—this directly contradicts the transcript (D-10/P-10; D-15/P-15; D-16/P-16; D-17/P-17). It also fails to correctly identify the full set of pertinent negatives. While it gives generally plausible clinical reasoning about how absence of chest pain/palpitations/runny nose/nausea can shift the differential, its core factual claim about what was asked/denied is wrong.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that should be included: (1) runny nose/congestion denied; (2) vision/hearing changes denied; (3) nausea/vomiting denied; (4) chest pain denied; (5) palpitations/fast heartbeat denied; (6) abdominal pain denied; (7) urinary symptoms denied; (8) numbness/tingling denied; and (9) explanation tying these negatives to narrowing toward infection/possible COVID and away from cardiac/GI/neuro causes. The Generated Answer omits almost all of (1)-(8) by asserting they were not present, and it does not mention vision/hearing changes, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or numbness/tingling at all. It only partially addresses (9) in a generic way.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not grounded in the transcript because it repeatedly claims the transcript does not mention/negate symptoms that are clearly present and negated in the transcript (runny nose, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations). It also adds framing like “provided transcript and knowledge graph” (no knowledge graph is provided). Although it quotes some transcript lines about dyspnea characterization and cough frequency, the central claims about absent ROS questioning are fabricated/contradictory to the source.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to answer both parts of the question (list negated symptoms and explain how they help differentiate causes of respiratory distress). However, because it misidentifies what was explicitly asked/negated, it only partially addresses the question. The differential-diagnosis discussion is generally on-topic but built on an incorrect premise."
