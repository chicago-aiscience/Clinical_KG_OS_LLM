{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the timeline of activities, the doctor's calculated attachment duration, the geographic location of Strathroy, and the use of the Ontario Lyme disease map to justify treatment.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the core components of the question. However, it omits the specific detail that the tick was removed 'earlier today,' which serves as the anchor point for the 72-hour calculation, and the patient's uncertainty about the exact attachment time mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript. However, the answer includes a reference to a 'knowledge graph' and a '[RISK_FACTOR]' tag, neither of which appear in the provided source transcript, representing a minor hallucination of external metadata or model-specific tokens.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the two parts of the question, providing clear headings for the attachment duration and the geographic risk assessment."
