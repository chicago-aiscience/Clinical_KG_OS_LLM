  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer: it correctly states that the child intermittently uses OTC Reactine/“over the counter stuff” for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications involved. However, it omits the explicit point that nothing is given for the current wheezing/SOB episodes (they resolve on their own with rest), which is a key part of the medication/treatment history asked in the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: (1) occasional OTC antihistamine/Reactine for seasonal allergies; (2) no prescribed medications. Key points missed: (1) mother does not give anything for the current respiratory episodes and they resolve with rest; (2) prior viral infections did not require antibiotics; (3) reaffirmation that there are no regular medications aside from occasional Reactine (partially implied but not explicitly stated). Overall coverage is substantial but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (Reactine/OTC use; no prescribed meds). The reference to a “Knowledge Graph” is not present in the transcript and is an extraneous, unverifiable framing detail, though it does not introduce a new clinical fact. No major hallucinated medications or treatments are added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments and whether prescribed medications were part of management. It is relevant to the question, but it incompletely addresses the ‘current respiratory episodes’ portion by not stating that no treatment was given for those episodes."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and relevant (OTC Reactine only; no prescriptions), but it misses key transcript-supported details about no treatment for the current wheezing episodes (and other minor history such as no antibiotics), reducing completeness."
