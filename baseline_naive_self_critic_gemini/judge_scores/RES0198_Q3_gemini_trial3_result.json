  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's conclusion and the absence of systemic symptoms (fever, chills, etc.). However, it misses the crucial factual detail regarding the discharge quality ('clear'), which is a primary piece of evidence used to rule out bacterial infection in clinical practice and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is significantly less complete than the Gold Answer. It misses several key evidentiary points: the duration of symptoms (one week), the specific progression (stuffy to runny), the quality of discharge (clear vs colored), the explicit exclusion of allergic triggers (fumes, dust, animals), and the specific exposure history (nephew in daycare). It fails to adequately address the 'rather than allergic' part of the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer references a 'provided knowledge graph' which does not exist in the source transcript or context, indicating a hallucination or a template error. Other clinical details mentioned are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but omits the comparative logic required to differentiate the condition from allergic or bacterial causes, focusing more on the 'viral' classification generally and the pandemic context rather than the specific patient history provided in the transcript (like allergy history). Highlights specific symptoms but lacks the 'why not X' reasoning found in the Gold Answer and the prompt's requirements (e.g., exposure history).\", \"relevance\": \"The answer addresses the question but omits the comparative logic required to differentiate the condition from allergic or bacterial causes, focusing more on the 'viral' classification generally and the pandemic context rather than the specific patient history provided in the transcript (like allergy history).
