  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the absent clinical features (bullseye rash, joint pain, systemic symptoms, and headaches) and the proposed tests (tick identification and blood work).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the gold answer: it does not mention the physical examination of the bite site or the doctor's plan to consult a supervising physician as part of the proposed evaluation. It also omits the screening for other bites on the body and the patient's general affirmation of feeling well.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. The citations provided correctly correspond to the dialogue turns where the information is found.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question regarding clinical features and diagnostic tests."
