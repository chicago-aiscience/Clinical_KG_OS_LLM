  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly links a missed anti-epileptic dose (Keppra) with a breakthrough seizure and correctly cites the patient’s statement in P-9 as evidence of the patient attributing the seizure to missed medication. However, it introduces an unsupported claim/source (“According to the Knowledge Graph… forgot medication --[PRECIPITATES]--> seizure”), which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer and makes the explanation partly inaccurate in its evidentiary basis.",
    "completeness": "It captures the two core elements of the Gold Answer: (1) missed Keppra dose as the likely trigger and (2) the patient’s self-recognition in P-9 (“I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have…”). It omits several supporting points emphasized in the Gold Answer: the missed dose occurring in the context of a disrupted routine due to the daughter’s birthday/dinner change (P-24), the fact the seizure happened that night (timing/temporal linkage), that the attribution was volunteered in response to a different question (D-9) rather than direct adherence questioning, that seizures are usually rare for the patient (P-9), and that there is no clinician-confirmed causality stated.",
    "faithfulness": "The citation to P-9 and P-23 is grounded in the transcript. The “Knowledge Graph” relation and bracketed ontology-style labels are not present in the conversation and therefore represent hallucinated framing/evidence. The causal interpretation (missed dose precipitating seizure) is plausible and consistent with the patient’s own attribution, but the answer is not fully grounded due to the fabricated ‘knowledge graph’ support.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question—how the missed dose connects to the seizure and what conversational evidence shows the patient recognized that link—without significant tangents."

  "summary": "Mostly addresses the causal link and correctly uses P-9 as evidence, but is less complete than the Gold Answer and adds an unsupported “knowledge graph” justification that is not grounded in the transcript."
