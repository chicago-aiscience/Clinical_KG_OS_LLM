  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on factual accuracy regarding the specific constraints of the question. It lists clinical findings from the entire transcript (e.g., scratchy throat, post-nasal drip) rather than focusing on what the doctor specifically recapped in the summary (D-58). Most importantly, it incorrectly identifies Jessica's primary goal as 'seeing her family doctor,' which was a detail mentioned earlier in the visit (D-22/P-22) regarding her past medical history. The Gold Answer correctly identifies her goal as wanting to know if she needs medicine (P-60).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses nearly all specific points from the doctor's recap in D-58, such as the absence of sputum production, the lack of asthma, the contact history with her brother, and the exclusion of other medications in the summary. It also misses Jessica's stated desire to go home and rest.",
    "faithfulness": "While the clinical symptoms listed exist in the transcript, the Generated Answer hallucinates the 'Primary Goal' by misattributing a statement about her family doctor from the beginning of the visit as her goal for the end of the visit. It also ignores the doctor's specific framing in the recap (D-58), which explicitly stated she was taking no meds aside from Claritin, whereas the Generated Answer includes birth control.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer provides a general clinical summary of the patient but does not strictly follow the prompt's instruction to identify what was in the 'doctor's summary at the end of the visit.' The section on 'Primary Goal' is relevant to the prompt's question but factually incorrect based on the text provided for 'next steps.' Sugar-coating the response with Knowledge Graph references does not address the actual dialogue at the end of the transcript provided (D-58 to P-61)."
