  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states that the transcript “cuts off prior to the doctor making any medical decisions or proposing diagnostic procedures” and that there is “no reference to the specific rationale for ordering a COVID swab.” This is factually incorrect. In the transcript, the clinician explicitly proposes (1) a chest X-ray (“he might want to do a chest X Ray and get a better look…” [D-37]) and (2) a COVID swab, with a clear rationale (“because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately” [D-39]). Thus, the Generated Answer contradicts the source and the Gold Answer on the central facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include: chest X-ray proposed; COVID nasal swab proposed; rationale for swab is protocol/standard screening for symptomatic patients; brief explanation of X-ray; plan to arrange tests and return with supervising doctor; no medications prescribed. The Generated Answer provides none of these substantive points and instead claims the information is not present. Therefore, coverage is effectively 0% of required items.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not grounded in the transcript because it asserts the absence of diagnostic proposals and COVID-swab rationale, despite both being explicitly stated in [D-37] and [D-39]. This is a direct contradiction of the provided source, constituting a major faithfulness failure.",
    "relevance": "The response is framed as an attempt to address the question, but it does not actually answer it and incorrectly claims the information is unavailable. It remains somewhat on-topic (discussing inability to answer about diagnostics/COVID swab) but fails to provide the requested content."
