  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error. It explicitly states that nausea, joint pain, and rashes were not mentioned in the transcript, when in fact they were explicitly asked about by the doctor and denied by the patient in turns [P-10], [P-11], and [P-13]. It correctly identifies the reported symptoms of cough, throat, malaise, and headache.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete. It misses several symptoms denied by Jessica that were present in the Gold Answer and specifically mentioned in the prompt's examples: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, joint aches, and rashes. It also misses 'feeling tired' as a reported symptom.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source text because it claims the absence of information (nausea, joint pain, rashes) that is clearly present in segments [P-10] through [P-13].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in its structure, addressing both reported and denied symptoms, but it fails to provide the specific information requested regarding the parenthetical examples provided in the question."
