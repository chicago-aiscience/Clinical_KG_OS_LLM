  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly explains that the clinician inferred a >72-hour possible attachment based on exposure on Friday (hiking) and Saturday (gardening) and the clinician’s statement in [D-6] that it was “longer than at least 72 hours,” leading to prophylactic antibiotics. It also correctly states that the doctor used the Ontario Lyme distribution map and judged Strathroy “close enough to be considered…concerning” [D-13] to justify moving forward with antibiotics.\n\nHowever, it adds an unsupported claim: “supported by the knowledge graph indicating Strathroy is a [RISK_FACTOR] for Lyme disease,” which is not present in the transcript or Gold Answer. That extra rationale is not evidenced and slightly reduces factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered:\n- Hiking Friday and gardening Saturday with uncertain acquisition timing [P-1]. (Partially—activities included; uncertainty not explicitly emphasized.)\n- Tick discovered/removed earlier today and clinician linking time since outdoors to discovery [D-1, D-2]. (Missed/understated—does not mention “earlier today” [D-1] or [D-2].)\n- Clinician’s calculation that this implies >72 hours [D-6]. (Covered.)\n- Prophylactic antibiotics recommended due to duration [D-6]. (Covered.)\n- Strathroy exposure location [P-12] and map-based geographic risk assessment leading to antibiotics [D-13]. (Covered.)\n\nOverall, most core elements are present, but it omits some of the timeline scaffolding (earlier today; clinician’s interim reasoning in [D-2]) and the patient’s explicit uncertainty, so it’s not 100% complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly grounded in the transcript with correct citation references ([P-1], [D-6], [P-12], [D-13]). The main ungrounded element is the “knowledge graph”/“[RISK_FACTOR]” support for Strathroy, which is not in the transcript. Aside from that, the answer stays consistent with the provided dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) how Friday/Saturday outdoor activities led to estimating >72 hours attachment, and (2) how Strathroy’s position on the Ontario Lyme map increased concern and supported prophylaxis. No major irrelevant tangents."
