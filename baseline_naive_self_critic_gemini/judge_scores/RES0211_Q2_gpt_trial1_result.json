  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Claritin for seasonal allergies and that Jessica is not currently taking it but carries it “just in case” (consistent with [P-16, P-25]). It also correctly notes she takes birth control and has had allergy shots in the past. However, it contains a substantive error: it states that no dosing details were mentioned, but the transcript includes dosing/timing details for both the allergy shots (“once a week for a little while… in the winter before” [P-20]) and the contraceptive (“the one that goes for three months” [P-27]). It also fails to specify the contraceptive name (“Deyo”) which is explicitly stated [P-26].",
    "completeness": "Included: Claritin (indication and that she carries/not currently taking), birth control (general), prior allergy shots (general).\nMissed key Gold Answer elements: contraceptive name “Deyo” and the “goes for three months” detail; allergy-shot schedule (once weekly, in winter before season); explicit denial of medication allergies; denial of carrying an EpiPen and the context that her allergies are seasonal and not associated with facial swelling/breathing difficulty. Overall, it captures only a portion of the required names/indications/dosing details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (Claritin, birth control, allergy shots). The claim that no dosing details were mentioned is not faithful to the transcript because dosing/timing details are explicitly discussed ([P-20], [P-27]). No other clear hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic (current meds/carrying items and past allergist treatments). It does not add irrelevant information, but it under-delivers on the requested specifics."
