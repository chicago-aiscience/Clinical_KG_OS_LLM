  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly captures core pain features: initially “uncomfortable/odd,” later “very sharp, strong,” pleuritic with deep inspiration; symptoms for ~1.5 weeks; episodes ~20 minutes; occurs while studying/sitting and walking to school. However, it introduces notable inaccuracies: (1) it states the pain “does not resolve on its own,” which contradicts the patient’s report that it “kind of goes away”/is not noticed once at school talking/doing other things (P-9, P-29); (2) it links the pain to “an anxiety attack” and cites P-20, but P-20 discusses palpitations/heart flutter during anxiety attacks, not chest pain occurrence; (3) it implies a provider conclusion about exertion using D-18, which does not specifically address exertion (P-10 does). Overall, main point is present but with meaningful errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: quality (uncomfortable/odd; sharp/strong with deep breath), duration (~20 min episodes; ~1.5 weeks overall), intermittent nature, and common contexts (studying/sitting; walking to school).\nKey points missed or inadequately stated: that pain is noticed particularly when alone and tends to resolve/go unnoticed when engaged with others or tasks at school (P-9, P-29); explicit statement that it can occur at rest (D-11/P-11); denial of worsening with exercise (P-10); no injury/accident (P-5); no prior similar pain (P-17). Net coverage is partial (~50–70%).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not supported or are mis-grounded: (1) “pain does not resolve on its own” is not supported and conflicts with transcript (P-9); (2) association of pain with anxiety attacks is a misreading (P-20 is about palpitations); (3) the exertion-related attribution to D-18 is not grounded (exertion question is P-10). While many details are accurate and taken from the transcript, these constitute multiple hallucinated/misattributed claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on the asked characteristics (quality, duration, and when it occurs vs resolves). The OTC medication and anxiety/palpitations comments are tangential and, in parts, incorrect, but the content remains largely within the scope of chest-pain characterization."

  "summary": "Captures the main pleuritic, intermittent 20-minute episodes occurring during studying/walking, but misses the key resolve-with-distraction feature and adds unsupported anxiety-related and “does not resolve” claims, reducing faithfulness and overall accuracy."
