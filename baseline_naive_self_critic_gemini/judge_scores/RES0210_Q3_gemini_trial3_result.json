  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding the patient's symptoms. It accurately identifies the sputum characteristics (yellow custard with red spots), fever, dyspnea on exertion, and the nature of the right-sided chest pain as described in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention 'chills' as part of the systemic infection signs. 2) It does not mention that the chest pain is constant/dull even at rest (baseline), focusing only on the pleuritic exacerbation. 3) It entirely omits the patient's significant smoking history (pack-a-day for decades) as a predisposing factor for LRTI.",
    "faithfulness": "The response hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' and specific relational triggers (e.g., [TRIGGER] exertion) that were not part of the provided transcript or context. However, the clinical facts extracted (sputum color, pain location) are grounded in the transcript text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly answering the question about findings pointing to LRTI and explaining the diagnostic reasoning behind pleuritic pain."
