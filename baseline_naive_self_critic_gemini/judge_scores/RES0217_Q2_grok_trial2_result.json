  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts about the patient's current statin therapy for high cholesterol [P-15] and the doctor's proposal for prophylactic antibiotics [D-6, D-13, D-18] are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. No factual errors or contradictions; inferences like 'high cholesterol' align with 'cholesterol management' [P-14]. The addition of diagnostic measures (tick lab, blood work) is accurate to the transcript though not emphasized in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) current cholesterol management [P-14] and statin [P-15]; (2) no allergies [P-16, P-17]; (3) past tick bite with antibiotics [P-3]; (4) prophylactic antibiotics proposed with reasons, no specifics, consult physician [D-6, D-13, D-18, D-22]; (5) environmental insecticide [D-18]. Covered: statin therapy (partial, ~1.5 points), prophylactic antibiotics (partial, ~2 points). Missed: allergies, past treatment, consult details, environmental advice, cholesterol mgmt explicit. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about statin [P-15], prophylactic antibiotics [D-6, D-13, D-18], tick lab [D-6, D-18], blood work [D-18] are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, 'knowledge graph confirms' and 'statins treat high cholesterol' are not in transcript (general knowledge, unverifiable here), introducing hallucination/plausibility outside source.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question on medications/treatments discussed, explicitly covering current statin and new prophylactic treatments; diagnostic measures are relevant discussions in context with no off-topic content."
