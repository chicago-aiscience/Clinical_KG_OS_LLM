  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All included symptom statements align with the transcript and the Gold Answer: 3-month intermittent cough, productive “gunk”/greenish sputum, pain only with coughing, sleep disruption, fatigue, and exercise limitation are accurate. No clear contradictions or incorrect additions were made. However, several key characteristics (e.g., timing of productive phase, feverishness, absence of blood/odor) were omitted rather than misstated.",
    "completeness": "Captured: (1) chronic intermittent cough (~3 months), (2) productive sputum described as gross/greenish, (3) cough-related chest discomfort, (4) sleep disturbance and fatigue, (5) exercise limitation.\nMissed from Gold Answer: (1) initial dry cough and its onset context (pole dancing class), (2) productive change specifically over last ~3 days, (3) subjective fever/feeling hot at night, (4) no blood in sputum, (5) no foul smell noted, (6) cough waking her up nightly for ~1 month (frequency), and most explicit denials: night sweats, weight loss/loose clothes, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, body pain/tenderness, and lack of sick contacts. Overall coverage is well under 50% of key points, especially for the ‘explicitly denied’ portion.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer’s claims are grounded in the transcript (cough duration/intermittency, greenish sputum, cough pain, sleep disruption, fatigue, exercise limitation). No major hallucinated clinical facts were introduced. The phrase “Based on the transcript and knowledge graph” is extraneous but does not add factual content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on respiratory/associated symptoms and explicit denials, but it fails to address many of the denials the doctor asked about (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis, GI symptoms, stiff neck, etc.). It is therefore only partially responsive to the full scope of the question."

  "summary": "The generated answer is accurate and well-grounded for what it includes, but it is substantially incomplete—especially regarding the full set of cough/sputum characteristics and the multiple symptoms the patient explicitly denied."
