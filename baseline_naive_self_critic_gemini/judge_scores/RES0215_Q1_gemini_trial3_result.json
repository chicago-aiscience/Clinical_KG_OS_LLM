  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the transcript. It correctly identifies the primary symptoms (wheezing, shortness of breath, cough) and accurately identifies wheezing as one of the earliest symptoms mentioned by the mother.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main symptoms well but misses a few details present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention that 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' was also identified as an earliest symptom (P-2) alongside wheezing. It also omits the characterization of the cough as non-productive (no phlegm) and the absence of cyanosis, which the Gold Answer includes to provide a full picture of the reported symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, providing specific citations for each claim. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the specific symptoms at presentation and the symptoms that appeared first."
