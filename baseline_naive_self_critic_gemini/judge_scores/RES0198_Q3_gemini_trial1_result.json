  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the viral conclusion but misses key clinical differentiators mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the 'clear' quality of the discharge (which distinguishes it from bacterial) and the duration of one week. It also includes an hallucinated reference to a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the provided source materials.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) Evidence against allergic cause (no history of allergies, no exposure to dust/animals). 2) Specific evidence against bacterial cause regarding discharge color (clear vs colored). 3) The duration of symptoms (one week). 4) The specific exposure mentioned (nephew in daycare). It covers the absence of systemic features well but neglects the specific comparisons requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a reference to a '[Knowledge Graph]' that does not exist in the provided transcript. The other clinical points (symptoms, doctor's conclusion) are grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question regarding evidence for a viral infection. However, it largely ignores the 'rather than an allergic or bacterial cause' part of the prompt, providing only a brief mention of ruling out bacterial infections without the specific evidence (like clear discharge) cited in the transcript."
