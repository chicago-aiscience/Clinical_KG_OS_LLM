  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that Jessica's father's allergies [P-33], cousin's asthma [P-30], brother's cold [P-39], farm living [P-43-44], and home-schooling [P-41-42] are 'not mentioned' in the transcript, directly contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate citations and explanations; it only partially addresses the brother's cold but misattributes symptoms to a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' and confuses personal allergies with family history, resulting in mostly incorrect facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers: family history (father allergies P-33, cousin asthma P-30), allergies not yet seasonal (P-16/17), brother cold ~2 weeks (P-39/D-58), isolated farm life (P-43/44), home-schooling/COVID isolation (P-41/42), mom home/dad farm (P-42), minimal outings (P-45), no travel (P-46), only dog (P-48), pointing to household transmission; Generated covers brother's cold vaguely and personal allergies but misses/denies all specified family history and isolation factors, covering <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absence of clearly stated transcript details (father allergies P-33, cousin asthma P-30, farm P-43/44, home-school P-41); introduces unverifiable 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' not in transcript; partial citations like P-39/P-1 are accurate but overshadowed by multiple fabrications and denials.",
    "relevance": "Question specifically asks about relation of father's allergies, cousin's asthma, brother's cold, farm/home-schooling to symptoms; Generated denies most elements exist in text and pivots to personal allergies/exposure, partially touching brother's cold but failing to address collective relation or isolation context."
