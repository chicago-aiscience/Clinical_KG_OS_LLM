  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the diagnosis as 'viral infection like the common cold' matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-39]. It correctly lists supportive care (hydration and Tylenol Cold), diagnostic swab test for COVID with 48-hour results, and public health isolation/follow-up. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'swab test' vs 'COVID swab', adding pandemic context under diagnosis) are consistent with transcript facts and do not contradict Gold; no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers diagnosis, both specific supportive cares (hydration, Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (swab, 48 hours), and public health (isolation at home/not seeing others, further public health instructions). Misses explicit mention of 'few weeks to resolve symptoms' and 'not much beyond supportive care' from Gold's supportive care section, and 'today' for swab timing; covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All core claims (diagnosis, hydration, Tylenol Cold, swab today for COVID, 48 hours, isolation, public health follow-up) directly verifiable in [D-39] with accurate citations. Minor unverifiable addition of 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript or input); plausible rephrasing but fully grounded otherwise.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured and focused on the question's required elements (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance) with no off-topic content."
