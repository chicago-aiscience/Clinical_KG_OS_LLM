  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly links the new chest tightness/breathing difficulty to possible asthma recurrence/exacerbation and cites the clinician’s statement that asthma is high on the differential (D-35). However, it contains a major factual error by stating the transcript does not include details about skipping the evening maintenance dose or not refilling the rescue inhaler—these are explicitly described at P-17 to P-20. It also inaccurately paraphrases D-36 (walking is exertion; the clinician’s point is more about lack of classic ischemic features and no pain). Overall, key facts central to the question are contradicted.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) asthma history previously well-controlled, (2) reduced maintenance inhaler from BID to morning only, (3) did not refill rescue inhaler for years, (4) clinician connects medication “limiting” to symptoms, (5) symptom pattern consistent with asthma recurrence and rationale for obtaining rescue inhaler. Generated answer covers (1 partially) and (5 partially) and mentions clinician’s top differential, but omits (2)-(4) and the practical implication of lacking a rescue inhaler, which are central to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Some statements are grounded in the transcript (symptoms, asthma history, clinician’s assessment). But it introduces an unverifiable external element (“Knowledge Graph explicitly states…”) not present in the transcript, and it makes a clearly unfaithful claim that the transcript lacks the evening-dose skipping and rescue-inhaler lapse, which are present. These constitute multiple faithfulness issues.",
    "relevance": "It addresses the general relationship between asthma history and current symptoms, but it fails to address the question’s specific focus on how skipping the evening maintenance dose and not refilling the rescue inhaler could contribute to symptoms. The added ‘Knowledge Graph’ comment is also not needed for the question."
