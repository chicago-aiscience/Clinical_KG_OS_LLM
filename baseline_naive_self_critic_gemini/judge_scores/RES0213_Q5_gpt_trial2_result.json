  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Family history is accurately tied to her fear (father’s heart attack last year in his 50s; she says it “scares” her and she worries it’s a “heart thing” [P-8], consistent with Gold). Psychosocial stress is also correctly linked to anxiety physiology (nervousness, faster breathing, difficulty taking a deep breath because it makes her nervous [P-19], and thesis stress [P-15]). However, the answer introduces questionable causal claims not supported by the transcript/Gold, notably that “smoking is a physical trigger for her chest pain” (she explicitly says she doesn’t know what triggers it [P-8]) and it leans on an external “knowledge graph.” These are minor-to-moderate inaccuracies but the main conceptual relationships match the Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core idea that (1) father’s early MI drives fear, (2) smoking contributes to perceived cardiac risk and is hard to quit, and (3) thesis-related stress/anxiety affects symptoms and interpretation. Misses several Gold details: father now seeing “a lot of heart doctors” [P-30]; uncertainty about additional family history/paternal grandfather accident [P-30]; detailed smoking trajectory (started ~18, ~10/day for 2 years, now ~5/day) [P-14, P-18]; key psychosocial context (time crunch [P-16], living alone/limited social contact [P-27], nervous about running [P-28]); and prior anxiety attacks possibly returning [P-22].",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not directly supported by the transcript: references to a “knowledge graph,” the assertion that smoking is a trigger for her chest pain, and that she specifically interprets symptoms as “being a heart attack” (she says “heart thing,” not heart attack). Most quotes used are real and appropriately attributed (e.g., [P-8], [P-13], [P-15], [P-19], [P-6]), but the added unsupported causal links reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how family history, smoking, and stressors contribute to and interact with her heart-disease concern, using multiple transcript details. The “self-medication” paragraph is somewhat tangential to the asked interaction question, and the “knowledge graph” mention is irrelevant to the consultation."
