  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the primary progression (Wednesday evening start, Friday fever). However, it contains a minor logical error regarding the shortness of breath; it states the mother speculated the child had trouble breathing 'due to inactivity,' whereas the transcript indicates the mother was unsure of breathing difficulty because the child had been inactive (and thus not exertional). It also misses the mother's specific mention that the cough worsened on Thursday.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention that the cough 'seemed to get a little bit worse' on Thursday [P-1], the presence of a mild runny nose on Friday [P-16], and the specific details regarding disinterest in breakfast and suspected loss of taste [P-17]. It also omits the mother's specific summary of the three-day progression provided in [P-12].",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made are generally grounded in the transcript. The interpretation of the fatigue and appetite matches the dialogue. The slight misinterpretation of the breathing/inactivity link is more of a phrasing error than a fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the question's requirement for a day-by-day evolution and focusing on the symptoms requested (cough, fever, fatigue, appetite)."
