  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Nasal symptoms: Correctly states stuffy nose and runny nose (matches [P-1]).\n- Nasal discharge character: Incorrect/incomplete. The transcript explicitly states the discharge was “mostly clear” ([P-5]); the generated answer does not report “clear” and instead vaguely references “congestion and drainage” from the clinician’s question ([D-6]), which is not the patient’s characterization.\n- Explicitly denied related symptoms: Partly correct list (cough, sore throat, SOB, fever/chills, loss of taste/smell are indeed denied), but the generated answer incorrectly claims the patient did not explicitly say “no.” In the transcript the patient explicitly denies cough ([P-4]), other systemic symptoms including sore throat/SOB/fever/chills ([P-7]), and loss of taste/smell ([P-16]).\n- Post-nasal drip: Missed; patient explicitly denied back-of-throat drainage/post-nasal drip ([P-6]).",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer vs Generated Answer:\n- Covered: stuffy nose; runny nose; denied cough; denied sore throat; denied SOB; denied fevers/chills; denied loss of taste/smell; also included some additional negatives (headache/nausea/vomiting).\n- Missed: discharge described as “mostly clear” ([P-5]); explicit denial of post-nasal drip/back-of-throat drainage ([P-6]); symptom course details (initially stuffy then mostly running [P-3], ~1 week duration [P-2]) and mild fatigue ([P-15])—the latter two are in the Gold Answer though not strictly required by the user’s question.\nOverall, it captures some but not all key nasal-specific elements and misses an explicitly denied related symptom (post-nasal drip).",
    "faithfulness": "- Several statements are not well-grounded or are contradicted by the transcript:\n  - “the patient did not explicitly state the word ‘no’…” is contradicted multiple times ([P-4], [P-7], [P-16]).\n  - Discharge characterization is not grounded: it omits the patient’s “mostly clear” statement ([P-5]) and instead reframes the clinician’s question as if it were an identified finding.\n- Most other items (cough/sore throat/SOB/fever-chills/loss of taste-smell denial) are supported by the transcript.\n- Mentions of “knowledge graph”/“clinical documentation expert analysis” are extraneous and not transcript-based.",
    "relevance": "- Generally addresses the question (nasal symptoms, discharge, denied related symptoms).\n- However, it fails to provide the key discharge characteristic (clear) and omits post-nasal drip denial, which are central to the asked items.\n- Includes some extra negatives (headache/nausea/vomiting) not specifically requested, but still clinically related."
