  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the endorsed respiratory symptoms (worsening cough, shortness of breath with exertion, sputum change from clear-to-white/yellow to more yellow, chest discomfort during coughs), which align with the Gold Answer. However, it misses the endorsed systemic symptom of chills and incorrectly states that there are no explicit denials for key commonly screened symptoms like orthopnea [P-9], PND [P-10], hemoptysis [P-7], and palpitations [P-14], directly contradicting both the transcript and Gold Answer's listing of pertinent negatives. Minor discrepancy in sputum description (Gen says 'darker yellow' vs. transcript/Gold 'more yellow'). Significant errors on denials and missed chills.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: worsening cough over week [P-1,P-5], SOB last few days with minimal exertion [P-1,P-8,P-5], sputum change clear-to-white to yellow [P-6], chest discomfort [P-13]. Missed: cough triggered specifically by stairs [P-5], chills [P-29], no measured fever [P-29,P-30]. Completely misses all pertinent negatives listed in Gold (hemoptysis, orthopnea, PND, palpitations, etc.). Covers ~40% of key points, focusing only on respiratory endorsed while ignoring systemic and all denials.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims for endorsed symptoms are verifiable with accurate citations [P-1,P-3,P-5,P-6,P-8,P-13]. Sputum baseline slightly paraphrased but grounded. However, assertion of 'no specific explicit denials' for orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations, fever is false and not grounded—explicit denials exist in [P-7,P-9,P-10,P-14]; this is a hallucinated misreading. No other fabrications, but this key error indicates multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around endorsed respiratory symptoms, sputum change, and denied symptoms as per question, with no off-topic content or tangents. Partially addresses systemic/denied aspects erroneously but stays focused on the query."
