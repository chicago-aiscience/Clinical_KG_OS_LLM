  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states the raspy cough began on Sunday, when the Gold Answer and transcript clearly show it started on Friday [P-3]. It also incorrectly dates the fever to Sunday, when the transcript shows it started Monday [P-8]. The chest pain onset is vaguely described as 'current' rather than specifically Tuesday as indicated in the Gold Answer. The Generated Answer misses the one-week-prior runny nose entirely.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of key points. It correctly identifies: yellow sputum with red spots starting Sunday, chills in the last two days, and right-sided chest pain. However, it misses: the runny nose a week prior, the Friday onset of raspy cough, the Monday onset of fever, the Tuesday onset of chest pain, the continuation of symptoms Monday-Wednesday, and the characterization of pain as 'dull and constant.' It also omits the exertional dyspnea detail and sore throat context.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains multiple claims that contradict the transcript. The statement that the raspy cough began on Sunday contradicts [P-3] which clearly states Friday. The claim that fever began Sunday contradicts [P-8] which states Monday. While most other claims are grounded in the transcript, these two major errors significantly compromise faithfulness. The citation pattern is inconsistent and sometimes misleading.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by attempting to trace the timeline and symptom progression. However, it provides an incomplete and partially inaccurate timeline. The structure attempts to follow the requested format (specifying days and symptoms), but the execution contains errors that reduce its utility for answering the specific question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to provide a timeline but contains critical factual errors regarding symptom onset dates (raspy cough and fever). It misses important details like the runny nose a week prior and provides vague dating for chest pain. While it correctly identifies some symptoms and their Sunday onset, the inaccuracies in dating key symptoms (Friday raspy cough misattributed to Sunday, Monday fever misattributed to Sunday) and incomplete coverage of the week-long progression significantly compromise its correctness and faithfulness to the source material."
