  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered and ruled out, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [P-28]. It accurately reports the mother’s cited negatives: no shortness of breath and no wheezing, even with physical activity [P-28]. No contradictory or incorrect clinical details were added.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) asthma ruled out; (2) mother cites no shortness of breath; (3) no wheezing; (4) absence of these even with physical activity. Key points missed that are part of the Gold Answer and/or question framing: (a) explicit mention that the family history was in the grandparents (the answer does not state this); (b) that he had already “been worked up for that” (prior evaluation) [P-28]; (c) mother’s explicit conclusion that “he doesn't have that” [P-28]; (d) additional contextual negative/chronicity distinction from [P-24] (healthy otherwise/never had a dry cough like this), which the Gold Answer notes as supportive context (less central to the question but still omitted). Overall, it captures the core symptom-based rationale but omits important context requested (grandparents + prior workup).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript, particularly [P-28]. The answer does not introduce ungrounded symptoms or test results. Minor issue: it does not explicitly mention the grandparents, but it also does not fabricate that detail—so it remains faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked respiratory condition and the specific clinical findings (notably the absence of SOB/wheeze even with activity). However, it incompletely addresses the question’s explicit request about the positive family history in the grandparents and the supporting context used to rule asthma out."
