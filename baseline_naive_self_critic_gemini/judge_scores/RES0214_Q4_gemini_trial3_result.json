  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnostic test (COVID-19 swab) and the primary rationale (household transmission from the husband and the presence of infectious symptoms). These facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main points but misses the specific detail from the Gold Answer regarding the sequence of the conversation: that influenza was discussed as a secondary possibility only after the doctor learned the patient had not received a flu shot.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes references to a 'knowledge graph' twice. This is a hallucination as no knowledge graph was provided in the source transcript. However, the citations for the dialogue (e.g., [D-53], [P-19]) are accurate and the clinical logic is supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the user's question without unnecessary tangents."
