  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), tick attachment duration (>72 hours), geographic location (Strathroy assessed as concerning), and prior history (bullseye rash ~10 years ago requiring antibiotics). It also correctly notes that despite the tick not resembling a deer tick and no current bullseye rash, prophylaxis was recommended. The citation references [D-6], [D-13] align with the Gold Answer's cited passages.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: (1) exposure history with uncertainty about which activity caused attachment, (2) >72 hour attachment duration calculation, (3) Strathroy geographic assessment using Ontario Lyme map, (4) prior bullseye rash history, (5) acknowledgment that current tick doesn't resemble deer tick, (6) no current bullseye rash, and (7) decision to proceed with prophylaxis. The only minor omission is the patient's mention that 'all ticks in this area' are now considered possible carriers [P-5], though this is a supporting rather than essential detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript. The exposure history is from [P-1], the >72 hour calculation from [D-6], the Strathroy geographic assessment from [P-12] and [D-13], and the prior bullseye rash from [P-3]. The citations provided ([D-6], [D-13]) are accurate. No hallucinated content is present, and the answer appropriately qualifies the doctor's reasoning process.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the question: exposure history, tick attachment duration, geographic risk, and prior history. It explicitly explains how these factors combined to justify prophylactic antibiotics despite the tick not resembling a deer tick and no current bullseye rash. The answer stays focused on the specific clinical decision-making process without introducing tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a highly accurate and relevant evaluation that closely matches the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies all four key factors (exposure history, >72 hour attachment, Strathroy geographic risk, prior bullseye rash) and appropriately notes the decision to recommend prophylaxis despite the tick not resembling a deer tick and absence of current rash. All claims are well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The only minor gap is omitting the patient's comment about all ticks in the area now being considered possible carriers, which slightly reduces completeness but doesn't affect the core answer quality."
