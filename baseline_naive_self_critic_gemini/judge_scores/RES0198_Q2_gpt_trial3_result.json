  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Matches the Gold Answer: patient tried OTC decongestants and felt they helped “a little bit,” and clinician recommended OTC symptomatic therapy, specifically mentioning Tylenol Cold. No contradictory or incorrect statements.",
    "completeness": "Covers the three elements asked in the question and reflected in the Gold Answer (decongestants tried; modest benefit; Tylenol Cold recommendation). Does not include additional supportive-care details present in the Gold Answer (hydration, expected duration of illness), though those are ancillary to the specific question asked.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript: decongestants and “worked a little bit” are in [P-10]; Tylenol Cold is mentioned in [D-39]. No hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the user’s question with no tangential material."
