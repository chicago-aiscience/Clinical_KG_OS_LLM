  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the sputum as yellow custard with red spots (matches Gold [P-4,6,7]), right-sided chest pain that is always present and worsens with coughing/deep breathing (matches Gold [P-17-21]), chills (matches [P-9]), and fever (matches [P-5,8]). Minor discrepancies include misattributing 'raw' feeling from throat [P-15] to chest pain (Gold attributes raw to throat only) and omitting 'dull' quality and persistence when lying down for chest pain, but core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: sputum description and red spots (100%), chest pain location (right), partial quality (constant, worse with cough/breath; misses 'dull' and 'lying down'), chills, brief fever. Missed: cough timeline (Friday raspy, Sunday severe), sputum timing (Sunday simultaneous), detailed subjective fevers (Monday onset, felt hot no temp, persisting), dyspnea on exertion, sore throat, resolved runny nose, no weight loss. Covers ~60% of Gold key points, focused on question's specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: sputum [P-4,6], right pain [P-17], worsens deep breath/cough [P-18,19], chills [P-9], fever [P-5]. 'Raw' after coughing [P-15] is in transcript but contextually refers to throat (cited under chest pain, minor misinterpretation, not fabricated). No hallucinations; citations mostly accurate.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question's specifics (sputum color/appearance, chest pain location/quality, systemic fever/chills) with bullet points matching exactly; no off-topic content."
