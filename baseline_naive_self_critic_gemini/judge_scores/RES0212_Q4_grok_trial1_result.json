  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that night sweats and weight loss were not explicitly screened for, but the transcript shows they were asked about and denied [D-5 to D-8, P-5 to P-8]; it also misattributes nausea/vomiting denial to P-19 instead of P-17; while some screenings like chest pain, stiff neck are factual from transcript, they are not the core constitutional symptoms emphasized in Gold (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis); explanation links wrong symptoms to TB exclusion, contradicting Gold's focus. Significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: constitutional symptoms (night sweats [D5,P5], weight loss [D6-8,P6-8], hemoptysis [D10,P10]); exposures (sick contacts [D14,P14; D15,P15; D32,P32], travel [D33-34,P33-34], IVDU/cocaine [D39-40,P39-40]); additional (stiff neck [D18,P18], N/V [D17,P17], pain [D19,P19]); TB exclusion explanation and closing [D47]. Generated covers only chest pain [D3,P3], N/V, stiff neck (minor points); misses all main constitutional symptoms, all exposures, hemoptysis, and detailed explanations. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like chest pain, stiff neck, N/V are verifiable in transcript but with citation errors (e.g., P-19 for N/V); hallucination that night sweats/weight loss not screened (directly contradicted by D-5 to D-8); plausible but inaccurate TB exclusion via wrong symptoms; patient tiredness [P-19] verifiable. Multiple hallucinated or erroneous claims about screening.",
    "relevance": "Addresses screening of some symptoms denied and links to excluding TB/chronic infections, but ignores exposure risks entirely and focuses on non-constitutional symptoms (chest pain, stiff neck, N/V) instead of key ones like night sweats/weight loss; partially on-topic but misses half the question."
