  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several major factual errors relative to the Gold Answer/transcript. It incorrectly states the patient had an initial fever; the patient explicitly denied fevers [P-12]. It also incorrectly claims nausea/vomiting and belly pain occurred initially and resolved; the patient explicitly denied nausea/vomiting [P-19] and abdominal pain [P-20]. It mis-cites sore throat as coming from [P-14] (runny nose/flu-symptom comment) rather than the actual sore throat statement [P-13]. While it correctly notes early mucus that resolved and a persistent dry cough, and it correctly captures cough-associated chest soreness, the false positives (fever, GI symptoms) are significant.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: persistent cough for two weeks; early mucus that resolved; current dry cough; chest soreness with coughing. Key points missed: runny nose initially [P-14]; explicit timeline details (mucus for 4–5 days then dry); current cough frequency (~3–4 times/hour) [P-9]; spontaneous/no triggers [P-10]; stable intensity and frequency over two weeks [P-7, P-8]; and pertinent negatives (no dyspnea [P-11], no fever [P-12], no N/V [P-19], no abdominal pain [P-20])—some of which were instead incorrectly reported as present earlier.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not supported by the transcript and directly contradict it (fever; nausea/vomiting; belly pain). Additionally, references to a \"medical knowledge graph\" and asserted causal links are not part of the transcript, making portions of the answer ungrounded/hallucinated.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the question (resolved vs ongoing symptoms during the two-week illness). However, it includes irrelevant/unsupported \"knowledge graph\" commentary and introduces incorrect symptoms, which detracts somewhat from relevance but does not make it off-topic."
