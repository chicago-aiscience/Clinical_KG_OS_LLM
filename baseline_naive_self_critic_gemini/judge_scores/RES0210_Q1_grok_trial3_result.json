  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the sputum as 'yellow custard with spots of red' matching Gold [P-4,P-6,P-7]; chest pain location as right-sided [P-17]; pain worse with deep breaths/coughing and 'always there' [P-18,P-19]; chills [P-9]; and fever [P-5]. Minor discrepancies: attributes 'raw' feeling after coughing to chest pain citing [P-15], but [P-15] refers to sore throat; omits 'dull' quality [P-21], constant even lying down [P-20], fever details like subjective 'felt hot' without measurement persisting [P-8], and cough timeline. Core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: sputum description (yellow custard, red spots) yes; chest pain location (right) yes; quality (constant/always there, worse cough/deep breath) partially (misses 'dull', 'even lying down'); systemic fever (partial, misses start Monday, felt hot no temp, persisting); chills yes. Missed: cough onset (raspy Friday, worse Sunday), dyspnea on exertion [P-10,P-11], sore throat [P-15], resolved runny nose [P-16], no weight loss [P-22]. Covers ~60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: sputum [P-4,P-6], pain location/quality [P-17,P-18,P-19], chills [P-9], fever [P-5]. Minor issue: 'raw' [P-15] contextually for throat, not chest pain (slight misinterpretation, not hallucination). No fabricated content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by structuring response around sputum description, chest pain location/quality, and systemic symptoms (fever/chills); no off-topic content."
