  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three triggers (exercise from P-9, cold air from P-9/P-11, pollen from P-11) and family history (sister's asthma from P-32), and relates them to the exacerbation (increased bronchodilator use and symptoms). However, it introduces a non-existent 'knowledge graph' [KG] multiple times to justify triggers, which is not in the Gold Answer or transcript, creating factual errors. It also inaccurately separates pollen strictly as an 'allergy trigger' rather than an asthma trigger prompting allergy suspicion as in Gold. Core relation to exacerbation and allergy suspicion is present but with discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: three triggers with partial citations (exercise P-9, cold P-11, pollen P-11), link to allergy suspicion via pollen and undiagnosed status, family history of sister's asthma (P-32), relation to exacerbation via symptoms and increased inhaler use. Missed: explicit 'no other triggers' (P-10), clinician's 'that would make sense' (D-13), revisit of allergies (D-31/P-31), no other family breathing problems (P-33) or allergies (P-34), precise inhaler escalation from every 2 weeks to 5-6x/week (P-8), clinician's medication change suggestion (D-43). Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about triggers/symptoms are verifiable (e.g., P-9, P-11, P-32, P-1, P-15). However, multiple [KG] references to a 'knowledge graph' confirming triggers/allergies are entirely hallucinated, as no such graph exists in the transcript. Separation of pollen as allergy-specific is plausible but not directly grounded; overall, significant unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how specified triggers (exercise gym/recess, cold winter, pollen spring) and family history relate to exacerbation (symptoms, inhaler overuse) and doctor's allergy suspicion (via pollen link). Minor tangents include extra symptom details and KG, but core focus matches question."
