  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies Lipitor (atorvastatin) for high cholesterol as the only prescribed medication [P-25-27], Tylenol OTC for symptom relief related to feeling feverish/unwell with partial effectiveness ('helps a little bit') [P-14], no other meds, and notes non-med relief from expectoration [P-13]. Generated Answer correctly identifies both medications, their types (prescribed/OTC), conditions (high cholesterol for Lipitor exact; Tylenol for cough is a minor discrepancy as transcript context is broader symptoms including fever but centered on cough), and OTC effectiveness exactly. Core facts match, minor issue on Tylenol purpose.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Lipitor for cholesterol (covered), only prescribed med (implied but not explicit in Generated), Tylenol OTC for feverish symptoms with 'helps a little bit' effectiveness (covered, minor condition variance), no others mentioned (not stated), non-med expectoration (not a med, omitted appropriately). Covers ~90% of med-related points, misses explicit 'only' and extras like allergies/cannabis.",
    "faithfulness": "All med claims verifiable: Lipitor/cholesterol [P-25-26], Tylenol/effectiveness [P-14], cough context [P-1, surrounding]. Citations accurate. Minor issue: Generated references non-existent 'provided knowledge graph' (hallucination). Tylenol 'for cough' plausible from context but interpretive.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly lists medications, conditions, and OTC effectiveness with evidence, perfectly matching question focus without off-topic content."
