  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correct: Reports a mostly dry cough with onset ~4 days ago; vomiting occurred yesterday with 2 episodes; headache severity 7/10 and persistent; diarrhea frequency 5–6/day with liquid stools.\n- Incorrect: States diarrhea began ~4 days ago and cites [P-1]; the transcript specifies diarrhea started ~2 days ago [P-28].\n- Partially correct/underspecified: Does not state key characteristics noted in the transcript (e.g., no sputum/blood with cough; no blood in stool or emesis; vomitus was food contents), but these are more omissions than direct contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points vs Generated Answer:\n- Cough: Includes dry nature and ~4-day onset (covered). Misses no sputum/blood, stability over 4 days, and respiratory negatives (no SOB/wheeze/chest pain) (missed).\n- Diarrhea: Includes liquid stools and 5–6/day (covered). Misses correct onset (~2 days), and no blood (missed/incorrect onset).\n- Vomiting: Includes 2 episodes yesterday (covered). Misses associated nausea today, no blood, and food contents (missed).\n- Headache: Includes onset, persistence, and 7/10 severity (covered). Misses location (forehead/top, bilateral), no radiation/neck stiffness, and ‘unusual for patient’ (missed).\n- Other relevant symptoms in Gold (loss of smell, mild fatigue) are omitted.\nOverall, it captures some of the asked specifics but omits many clinically relevant characteristics documented in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most included details are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations (dry cough [P-12], 5–6 diarrhea episodes/day [P-28], vomited twice [P-32], headache 7/10 [P-8]).\n- However, it misattributes diarrhea onset as ~4 days ago using [P-1], which does not support that claim and contradicts [P-28] (~2 days). This is a notable grounding/citation error.\n- Minor non-transcript phrasing (“knowledge graph information provided”) is extraneous but not a factual claim about symptoms.",
    "relevance": "- The response is largely focused on the requested GI and respiratory symptoms and includes the specifically requested items (nature of cough, diarrhea frequency, vomiting episode count, headache severity).\n- It is slightly limited by not listing other symptom characteristics/negatives that the question broadly asks for (“specific characteristics of each”), but it does not go off-topic."
