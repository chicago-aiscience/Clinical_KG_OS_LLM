  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts about family history (father's heart attack in 50s scaring her [P-8]), smoking (trying to quit, hard [P-13]), and stressors (thesis nervousness [P-15], breathing faster [P-19]), aligning with Gold. Minor discrepancies include omitting 'last year' and father's ongoing doctors [P-30], specific smoking quantities [P-18], additional stressors like living alone [P-26/27] and running [P-28], past anxiety [P-22]; introduces external 'knowledge graph' not in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: family fear [P-8]; smoking difficulty quitting [P-13]; thesis stress [P-15]; worry 'heart thing' [P-8], nervous breathing [P-19]. Missed: father's 'last year' and 'heart doctors' [P-30]; grandpa accident [P-30]; smoking details (18 start, 10/day then 5 [P-14/18]); full stressors (time crunch [P-16], alone [P-26/27], running [P-28]); past anxiety [P-22]. Covers ~60-70% of Gold's specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like family/smoking/stress citations [P-8,P-13,P-15,P-19] verifiable in transcript. Hallucinations: 'knowledge graph' references (smoking/chest pain, stress/chest pain) not in transcript; 'doctor raises smoking early [D-18]' (not early, mid-conversation); interpretive 'physical trigger', 'not merely psychogenic' not directly grounded. Multiple unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three specified factors (family, smoking, stressors), their contributions to heart disease concern, interactions (cycle of anxiety), and transcript details/citations, with minor off-topic elements like external knowledge graph."
