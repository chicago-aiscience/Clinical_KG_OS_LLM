  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the timeline: cough starting Wednesday evening as mild dry [P-1], tiredness on Thursday [P-1], worsening cough and new fever on Friday [P-1, P-2], and decreased appetite [P-15]. It aligns with Gold's core facts, including no other symptoms Wednesday; minor addition of breathing speculation [P-8] is factual from transcript and consistent. No contradictions or errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: cough first Wed eve (✓), severity progression implied (mild Wed, tired Thu with cough persistence, worsening Fri); fatigue Thu (✓), fever Fri (✓), decreased appetite Fri (✓). Missed: explicit Thu cough 'bit worse'; Fri specifics like runny nose [P-16], suspected loss of taste [P-17], additional fatigue [P-25], mother's stepwise summary [P-12], 3-day correction [P-4]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Wed cough [P-1], Thu tired/not running [P-1, P-8], Fri cough worse/fever [P-1, P-2], appetite [P-15]. Citations accurate; breathing speculation accurately reflected as mother's 'maybe' [P-8]. No hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured day-by-day addressing evolution, cough onset/severity changes, fever/emergence of fatigue/appetite issues. Minor breathing note is contextually relevant to activity/fatigue; no off-topic content."
