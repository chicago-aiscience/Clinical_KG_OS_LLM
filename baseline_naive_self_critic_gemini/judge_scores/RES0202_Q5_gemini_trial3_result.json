  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the mother suspected school as the source of COVID-19 and that the school had not notified her of exposures. However, it is slightly inaccurate in how it describes external contacts; it states 'no other external contacts are mentioned,' whereas the mother explicitly confirmed 'we know for sure' there were no sick contacts outside of school. Additionally, it incorrectly frames the younger sister as a reported contact in the context of the source of illness, when she was only mentioned as a person to isolate from.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention the exclusion of travel and home environmental factors which narrowed the source to the school. 2) It misses the detail about the school requiring a test to return so they could inform other families of exposure. 3) It omits the mother's specific 'hard to say' nuance regarding sick contacts at school.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. It does not hallucinate information outside of the provided text, although its interpretation of the mother's report on external contacts is slightly imprecise.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's core components: the role of school attendance, the report on sick contacts (school vs. outside), and school notification."
