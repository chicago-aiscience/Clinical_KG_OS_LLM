  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript ends at [P-32] and lacks the clinician's plan, directly contradicting the Gold Answer which accurately cites D-29 (COVID swab), D-43 (medication change suggestion), and D-43/D-29 (consultation with doctor); no facts align with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) COVID swab diagnostic test (D-29); (2) medication regimen change suggestion (D-43); (3) consultation with supervising physician and return to patient (D-29, D-43). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead summarizing unrelated symptoms and denying the plan's existence.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the 'provided context' ends at [P-32] and excludes the plan, but the full transcript includes D-29 to D-44 with all plan details; symptom summary is verifiable but irrelevant, and core claim about transcript content is fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The answer refuses to address the question about the clinician's plan, claiming insufficient context despite full transcript availability, and pivots to symptom summary and asthma diagnosis, which does not answer the query."
