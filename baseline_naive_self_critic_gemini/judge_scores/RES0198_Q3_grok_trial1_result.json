  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer includes some accurate facts from the transcript, such as the doctor's conclusion [D-39], present symptoms (stuffy/runny nose), and absence of certain features (sore throat, SOB, fevers/chills [D-7], headaches [D-14], anosmia [D-16]), which align partially with Gold's emphasis on absent features. However, it introduces a hallucinated 'knowledge graph' not present in the transcript, fails to specify clear discharge quality [P-5], duration [P-2], symptom progression [P-3], and explicit contrasts against allergic (no allergies [P-28], no exposures [P-22], no prior episodes [P-9]) or bacterial causes (no colored discharge, no fever), leading to significant discrepancies from Gold's detailed reasoning.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) symptom type/absent lower/systemic features (congestion/rhinorrhea, no cough [P-4], no sore throat/SOB/fever/chills [P-7], no post-nasal [P-6]) - partially covered (some absences but misses cough, post-nasal); (2) clear discharge [P-5] - missed; (3) 1-week duration/constant [P-2,P-8], fits viral - missed; (4) progression stuffy to runny [P-3] - missed; (5) against allergic (no exposures [P-22], no allergies [P-28], no recent priors [P-9]) - completely missed; (6) against bacterial (no fever/headache [P-7,P-14], clear discharge) - partially (absences but no discharge detail); (7) daycare exposure [P-11] - missed. Covers ~20-40% (mainly partial absences and conclusion).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about symptoms, doctor's conclusion [D-39], and specific absences [D-7,D-14,D-16] are verifiable in transcript; pandemic context [D-39] is accurate. However, association 'explicitly' via 'knowledge graph [Knowledge Graph]' is fully hallucinated (no KG in transcript); 'high-exposure environment' vaguely infers pandemic but misaligns with discussed exposure history (e.g., no sick contacts, daycare). Multiple hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly attempts to list evidence for viral diagnosis (symptoms, absences, conclusion), addressing part of the question on symptom characteristics and absent features, but largely ignores required contrasts to allergic/bacterial causes, specific elements like duration/discharge quality/exposure history, and includes off-topic pandemic emphasis over transcript-discussed exposures; partially relevant with some tangents."
