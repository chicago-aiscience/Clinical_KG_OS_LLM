  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error regarding the impact of symptoms on the patient's routine. It states the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine,' whereas the transcript (P-22) and Gold Answer explicitly state the patient reduced his walks from twice daily to once daily. Additionally, it fails to capture the patient's specific assessment that the symptoms have been 'staying the same' or 'pretty steady' over the three-day period, instead focusing on the acute worsening during activity.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The explicit trend that symptoms have been 'staying the same' over the three days, and 2) the specific quantitative change in the walking routine (reducing from two walks to one).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer includes a reference to 'Knowledge graph data [KG],' which is not present in the provided transcript and constitutes a minor hallucination/external injection. More importantly, it misrepresents the patient's testimony in P-22 regarding his walking habits, claiming he maintains his routine when he stated he has limited it.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in terms of structure, addressing each part of the multi-part question asked in the prompt."
