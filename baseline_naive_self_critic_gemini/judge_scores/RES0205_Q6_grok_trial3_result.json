  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states that the consultation does not contain the doctor's stated plan, physical examination components, or process for next steps, claiming the transcript ends at [P-35] with no subsequent doctor responses. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer and transcript, which include [D-37] explicitly detailing the plan (listen to heart and lungs, quick physical exam, consult supervising doctor, review discussion, reconvene for next steps). This is a complete factual contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: multi-step plan at end [D-37]; specific exam (auscultation of heart/lungs, quick physical); collaborative process (consult supervising physician, review everything, return together); foreshadowed in [D-1]; patient agreement [P-37]; no diagnosis/meds yet. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, asserting none exist.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that transcript ends at [P-35] and lacks any plan or exam details; [D-37] and [D-1] directly contradict this with verbatim plan description. No claims verifiable in transcript; entirely fabricated absence.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by asserting what is or isn't in the transcript regarding the plan, exam, and process, with no off-topic content or tangents."
