  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the medication tried (decongestants), the patient's assessment (worked a little bit), and the doctor's recommendation (Tylenol cold).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points but is slightly less detailed than the Gold Answer. It misses the specific nuance regarding why the patient thought the decongestant worked (the transition from stuffy to runny) and omits the doctor's recommendation to stay 'well hydrated' and the context of 'supportive care'.",
    "faithfulness": "All information in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript with correct speaker citations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the three specific components of the question without unnecessary information."
