  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is almost entirely incorrect. It claims the consultation has not reached a conclusion and that the information is missing, whereas the Gold Answer correctly identifies the plan and assessment in [D-47]. Furthermore, the Generated Answer incorrectly states that the patient had pleuritic chest pain and night sweats, when the patient explicitly denied these in [P-3] and [P-5].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the summary assessment, the specific plan to review with other doctors, and the identification of the speaker as a trainee.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It claims the transcript ends at [P-47] (ignoring [D-48] and [P-48]) and hallucinates symptoms (night sweats, pleuritic chest pain) that the transcript explicitly states the patient does not have.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is not relevant because it refuses to answer the question, claiming the information is unavailable when it is clearly present in the provided text."
