  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms cited by the doctor for a general infection (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches) and those cited for not ruling out COVID-19 (difficulty breathing, cough, sore throat) based on turn D-36. It correctly differentiates between what the doctor explicitly listed in the summary and what the patient reported earlier (loss of taste), which aligns with the nuance in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all the symptoms requested in the prompt. It captures the distinction between the general infectious process and the specific COVID-19 concerns. While it doesn't mention the follow-up actions (swab and isolation) mentioned in the Gold Answer, those were not specifically asked for in the prompt, which focused on 'specific symptoms'.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript, providing accurate citations for turn D-36, P-1, P-4, and P-20. However, it refers to a 'knowledge graph' as a source of support multiple times, which was not provided in the context, representing a minor hallucination of the available source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the user's question with clear, structured sections."
