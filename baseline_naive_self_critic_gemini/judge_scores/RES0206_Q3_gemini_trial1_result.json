  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the symptoms of cough, sputum production, and dyspnea. It correctly identifies the doctor's assessment and clinical interpretation of green-yellow sputum. However, it fails to mention the fever, which was specifically asked about in the question.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including the decreased exercise tolerance (walking the dog), the known sick contact, and the exclusion of other triggers like smoke or medication non-adherence. Most notably, it omits the 'fever' requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms and quotes provided are directly supported by the transcript. The mention of a 'Knowledge Graph' appears to be an artifact of the generation process but does not introduce hallucinated clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it ignores a specific component of the question: how fever helps distinguish between the two diagnoses. It addresses the sputum and the dual assessment well but provides an incomplete response to the prompt's specific instructions."
