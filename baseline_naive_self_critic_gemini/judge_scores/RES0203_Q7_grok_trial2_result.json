  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately states all symptoms began simultaneously two days prior, confirmed cough same time, symptoms consistent without worsening or fluctuation (citing P-5, P-8), partial sensory loss persisted, and no prior similar symptoms (P-3). Generated Answer correctly identifies concurrent onset two days ago but incorrectly claims no information on worsening/fluctuation (contradicts P-5, P-8 stating 'pretty consistent') and no information on prior symptoms (contradicts P-3 'no, nothing like this'); uses precise terms 'anosmia' and 'ageusia' not matching partial loss described. Significant factual errors and contradictions on key elements.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: simultaneous onset of all three (with cough confirmation), consistent sensory symptoms (no fluctuation), consistent cough (no worsening), none intermittent/variable, partial sensory loss throughout, no prior history. Generated covers only concurrent onset/timing (~20-25%); misses confirmation, consistency, no worsening/fluctuation, partial nature, prior history denial.",
    "faithfulness": "Timing claim verifiable in P-1/P-2/P-6; however, 'no information on worsening/fluctuation' is false (directly contradicted by P-5 'pretty consistent' for sensory, P-8 for cough); 'no specific information on previous experience' false (P-3 explicit denial); terms anosmia/ageusia not grounded (partial loss in P-4); multiple hallucinated absences of transcript info.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around question elements (timing relative to each other, severity/fluctuation, prior experience) with no off-topic content or tangents, perfectly focused despite inaccuracies."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is partially correct on symptom timing but significantly errs by denying transcript evidence on consistency/progression and prior history, resulting in low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness despite high relevance."
