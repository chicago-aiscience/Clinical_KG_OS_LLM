  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient’s only asthma medication is a bronchodilator/rescue medication used for symptom relief (supported by P-1, D-4/P-4, D-6/P-6). However, it contains two major factual errors compared with the Gold Answer and transcript: (1) it incorrectly states the transcript does not specify the administration route—yet the clinician explicitly clarifies it is a “puffer” (D-7/P-7); and (2) it incorrectly claims the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication—yet the clinician asks about a medication taken “every day no matter what” (D-5) and the patient says they do not have one (P-5). These errors directly contradict the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points required by the question/Gold Answer: (a) only medication is a bronchodilator/rescue inhaler; (b) administered via a puffer/inhaler; (c) clinician asked about a daily controller/maintenance medication taken every day, which the patient does not have. The Generated Answer includes (a) but misses (b) and (c), and in fact negates them. It also omits the explicit “as-needed” confirmation from D-4/P-4 and the explicit denial of other meds (D-6/P-6; D-30/P-30) as core supporting points. Overall coverage is well under 50% of the key requested elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in (and indeed contradict) the transcript: it asserts administration is not specified, but D-7/P-7 specify a puffer; it asserts no discussion of daily controller medication, but D-5/P-5 explicitly address this. It also introduces “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript. While some trigger-related details (exercise/cold/pollen) are supported (P-9, P-11), the major contradictions constitute multiple unfaithful claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer is organized around the exact components asked (current medication, administration, daily controller medication) and largely stays on-topic, though it adds some non-essential trigger discussion. Despite being on-topic, it incorrectly denies key transcript content."
