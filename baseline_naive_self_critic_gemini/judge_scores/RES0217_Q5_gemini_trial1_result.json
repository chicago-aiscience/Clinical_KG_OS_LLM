  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the 72-hour attachment duration mentioned in the transcript [D-6] and the use of the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map to justify treatment due to Strathroy being a 'concerning point' [D-13].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the major points: the specific activities (hiking/gardening), the resulting 72-hour calculation, the specific geographic location (Strathroy along the creek), and the doctor's use of the map. It misses a few nuances found in the gold answer, such as the patient's explicit uncertainty about the attachment time ('I don't really know when I got it') and the specific mention that the tick was removed 'earlier today' [D-1], which serves as the temporal anchor for the doctor's calculation.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript. However, the answer includes references to a 'knowledge graph' and a '[RISK_FACTOR]' tag which are not present in the source transcript. This suggests the inclusion of external structural information or model-specific artifacts not found in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without unnecessary digression, effectively linking the activities to the duration and the location to the map-based justification."
