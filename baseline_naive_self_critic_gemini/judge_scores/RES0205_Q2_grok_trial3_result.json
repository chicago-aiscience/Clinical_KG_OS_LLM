  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the patient's management of acid reflux via dietary changes (avoiding acidic foods and chocolates, effective per [P-25]), which matches Gold. It correctly notes no current medication for cough and patient seeking it ([P-35]), consistent with Gold. No factual errors or contradictions, but omits explicit statement of no prescribed meds overall ([P-23]) and past anxiety meds, treated as minor discrepancy since core facts on mentioned topics are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: dietary management for acid reflux including specifics and effectiveness ([P-25]); no meds for reflux; patient seeking cough meds but none current ([P-35]). Missed: explicit no prescribed meds overall ([P-23]); past anxiety meds 2-3 years ago ([P-24]); anxiety as condition ([P-22]); hay fever with no treatment ([P-27]); doctor's plan (exam/consult [D-37]); zero meds summary across all conditions. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations ([P-22], [P-25], [P-14], [P-5], [P-15], [P-35], [P-17]). No hallucinations; PPE mention grounded in work context though not treatment. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses acid reflux treatment (specified in question) and cough medication status (relevant to current issue). Includes some extra cough symptom details (tangents) but stays focused on treatment/med status; partially covers 'across all conditions' by omission of anxiety/hay fever but no major off-topic content."
