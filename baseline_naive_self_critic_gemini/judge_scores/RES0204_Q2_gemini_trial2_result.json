  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript cuts off before any diagnostic procedures are proposed. In reality, the transcript explicitly mentions a chest X-ray in [D-37] and a COVID swab with its specific rationale in [D-39].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to identify any of the key points requested (chest X-ray, COVID swab, and the rationale of institutional protocol for symptomatic patients). It captures none of the information from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims the interaction ends before medical decisions are made, which is directly contradicted by the text in [D-37], [D-39], and [D-40]. This is an 'hallucination of absence' where the model fails to see existing data.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all, instead providing a meta-commentary on the perceived (but incorrect) limitations of the source text."
