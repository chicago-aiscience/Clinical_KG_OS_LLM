  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline: headache and cough starting 4 days ago [P-1], diarrhea ~2 days ago [P-28], loss of smell 1 day ago [P-24], nausea/vomiting a few days back [P-1, P-32]. Headache described as persistent at 7/10 [P-3, P-8], cough as stable and dry [P-11, P-12]. Minor discrepancies: does not explicitly state headache severity 'stayed the same' [P-9] (only persistent/current severity); implies nausea/vomiting after diarrhea ('shortly thereafter') though transcript lumps GI symptoms [P-1]; omits details like headache location [P-5], atypical nature [P-10], GI specifics (5-6x/day liquid stools [P-28], vomiting details [P-32/34]). No contradictions, core facts match Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: initial headache/cough 4 days ago; GI ~2 days later (diarrhea specified, nausea/vomiting noted); anosmia latest (1 day); cough stable; headache persistent (partial on stability). Misses: headache specifics (bilateral forehead/top [P-5], atypical [P-10], explicit 'same severity' [P-9]); detailed GI (5-6x/day, liquid, no blood, vomiting 2x yesterday food contents, nausea today); pertinent negatives (no fever/chills [P-18], no resp worsening). Covers ~85% of key timeline/stability points, strong on structure but lighter on details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: timelines [P-1, P-28, P-24, P-32]; headache persistent/7/10 [P-3, P-8]; cough stable/dry [P-11, P-12, P-1]. Citations accurate and match transcript content. No hallucinations; minor phrasing like 'shortly thereafter' for GI is plausible inference from 'then' in [P-1] without fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question: initial symptoms, GI/anosmia timing relative to onset, headache/cough stability. No tangents, directly addresses 4-day progression with bullet points matching query elements."
