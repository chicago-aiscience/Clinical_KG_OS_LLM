  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's description of exposure (Friday/Saturday), duration (72+ hours), geography (Strathroy), and medical history (10 years ago with bullseye rash).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points. However, it misses a specific detail found in the Gold Answer and transcript: the patient's observation that 'all ticks in this area' are currently being considered potential carriers regardless of appearance. It also omits the doctor's plan to send the tick to a lab for identification, which was part of the clinical reasoning process.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations for the specific points mentioned.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the multi-part question, focusing on the specific combination of factors that led to the antibiotic recommendation."
