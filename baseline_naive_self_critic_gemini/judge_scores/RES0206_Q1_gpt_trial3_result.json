  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the main respiratory symptoms from the transcript: increased cough, increased green/yellow sputum, small amounts of blood with hard coughing, and worse shortness of breath (all consistent with [P-1]). However, it incorrectly states she did not report systemic symptoms such as fever or headache; the patient did report a possible fever/feeling very hot ([P-9]–[P-11]) and a mild headache ([P-14]). It also mis-cites the “most bothersome” symptom as being supported by [P-1]; the explicit statement that cough was most bothersome occurs at [P-12].",
    "completeness": "It covers several key respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea) and identifies cough as most bothersome. It misses other key elements in the Gold Answer: reduced exercise tolerance/functional limitation ([P-4]), possible fever ([P-9]–[P-11]), and mild headache ([P-14]). It mentions sinus pressure, which is correct. It does not include the pertinent negatives listed in the Gold Answer (though those are not strictly required unless expected). Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Most respiratory claims are directly grounded in the transcript. However, the statement that she did not report fever or headache is contradicted by the transcript ([P-9]–[P-11], [P-14]). Additionally, the citation [P-1] for the most bothersome symptom is not supported; the relevant quote is at [P-12]. These issues reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked content: respiratory and systemic symptoms during the 3-day worsening and the most bothersome symptom. No major irrelevant tangents."
