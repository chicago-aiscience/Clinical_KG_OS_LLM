  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the duration of the cough (3 months), its intermittent nature, gross description, pain only when coughing, greenish sputum, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and exercise limitation, all matching the Gold Answer and transcript. However, it omits key details like the initial dry nature, onset during pole dancing, change to productive sputum specifically in the past 3 days, no blood in sputum, no foul smell, nightly awakenings for the last month, and subjective fevers (hot at night). For denials, it only covers pain/tenderness partially while missing night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis (no blood), nausea/vomiting, and stiff neck, representing significant omissions compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: cough duration/intermittent (1), gross description (part), chest pain only with cough (1), sputum gross/greenish gunk (part, misses no blood/no smell/3 days), sleep disturbance/fatigue (partial, misses full nightly last month), exercise impairment (1). Missed entirely: initial dry/recurrent, pole dancing onset, productive change past 3 days, no blood/no smell, fevers, full denial list (night sweats, wt loss, hemoptysis, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck). Covers approximately 25-30% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable in the cited transcript segments (e.g., [P-2] for cough duration/intermittent/gross/gunk; [P-9] for gross/greenish; [P-3] for pain when coughing; [P-19] for sleep/tired; [P-47] for exercise). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; minor paraphrasing is accurate. 'Knowledge graph' mention is extraneous but does not introduce false claims.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to directly address the question, with sections on respiratory symptoms/cough characteristics/sputum, associated symptoms, and explicit denials, containing no off-topic content."
