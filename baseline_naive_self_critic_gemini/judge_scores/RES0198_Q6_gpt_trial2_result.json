  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated working diagnosis (“most likely a viral infection like the common cold”), the two supportive care measures (hydrate; OTC Tylenol Cold), the COVID swab with a 48-hour turnaround, and the isolation/public health follow-up guidance. It does not introduce clinical facts that contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: (1) viral/common cold working diagnosis, (2) hydrate, (3) OTC Tylenol Cold, (4) COVID swab ordered today, (5) results in ~48 hours, (6) isolate at home/avoid others, (7) further instructions from public health after results.\nKey points missed: (a) expectation-setting that symptoms can take “a few weeks” to resolve, and (b) explicit statement that there is “not much we can do besides supportive care.”",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all content is directly grounded in [D-39]. However, the phrase “Based on the provided transcript and knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript (meta/hallucinated context), though it doesn’t alter the clinical content. Otherwise, statements (diagnosis, supportive care, swab, 48-hour results, isolation, public health follow-up) are transcript-faithful.",
    "relevance": "The answer remains focused on the requested elements: diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test ordered, and public health guidance, with no meaningful tangents."
