  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the 3-month onset (with pole dancing context), 1-month sleep disruption, and recent productive greenish sputum (past few days), aligning with Gold's core timeline. However, it omits the initial dry intermittent nature, the 'nightly' specification for sleep disruption (quoting only 'a little bit' from P-19, missing P-21), specifies 'few days' instead of exactly 3 days, and significantly contradicts Gold by denying subjective fevers despite P-4 explicitly stating 'feeling like hot at night in the past couple days,' which Gold accurately cites as subjective fevers. Citations are mostly accurate but minor issues (e.g., D-13 confirms patient's report). This constitutes significant factual errors on key question elements.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3mo onset at pole class [P-2,P-13]; dry intermittent next 2mo [P-2]; 1mo nightly sleep disruption [P-19,P-21]; 3d productive green sputum [P-2,P-9,P-12]; couple days subjective fevers [P-4]; doctor summary [D-47]; acute-on-chronic pattern. Generated covers: 3mo onset/pole; 1mo sleep disruption (misses nightly); few days productive green. Misses: dry/intermittent; exact nightly/3 days; fevers entirely; summary/pattern. Covers ~50-60% of key timeline points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: 3mo onset verifiable [P-2,P-13]; sleep 1mo [P-19]; productive green few days [P-2,P-9,P-12]. However, fevers section hallucinates absence ('not explicitly confirmed,' 'does not mention fever'), ignoring P-4 'feeling like hot at night past couple days'; confuses with night sweats denial [D-5,P-5]; misattributes inquiry timing. Quotes P-19 partially, omitting fuller context from P-21. Multiple unverifiable/misread claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly traces cough timeline in bullets matching question's elements (onset, sleep, productive, fevers), no extraneous content or tangents; perfectly focused despite errors."
