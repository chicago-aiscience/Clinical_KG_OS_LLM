  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the primary condition to rule out (COVID-19), the symptom combination (headache, cough, GI symptoms), and the specific characteristic symptom (loss of smell).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the majority of the key points. It includes the main symptoms mentioned in the gold answer (headache, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of smell) and the doctor's explicit statement. However, it misses the mention of fatigue [P-19] and the pertinent negatives (no fever, no runny nose, etc.) that were included in the gold answer's description of the symptom constellation.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using accurate quotes (e.g., [D-52], [P-24]) and correctly attributing the symptoms to the patient's reports.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and exclusively addresses the two parts of the user's question without including extraneous information."
