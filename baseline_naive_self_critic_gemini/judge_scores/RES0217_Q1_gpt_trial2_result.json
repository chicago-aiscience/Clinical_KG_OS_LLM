  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) are consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. However, the Generated Answer makes a major factual error about systemic symptoms: it states the patient \"reported\" joint pain rather than denying it. In the transcript, the doctor asks about joint pain [D-7] and the patient clearly answers \"No\" [P-7]. Fever/feverish screening and headache screening were correctly identified as denied.",
    "completeness": "Local symptoms are only partially captured (redness/tenderness/soreness). Missing key Gold Answer details: location described as the crease/behind the knee where it bends; tick was \"stuck pretty good\"; soreness described as skin/area back there and explicitly not the joint; denial of bullseye/target rash or larger circle rash; statement she felt otherwise totally fine. Systemic screening is incomplete/incorrect: joint pain denial is missed (and contradicted), and the doctor also screened for feeling ill/feverish (included as fever but not explicitly \"ill\"), and headaches were included.",
    "faithfulness": "Most local symptom claims are grounded in [P-1]. Fever and headache denial are grounded in [P-8] and [P-19]/[P-20]. The claim that the patient \"reported\" joint pain is not supported and contradicts [P-7], making the answer partially unfaithful. The reference to the doctor's summary about no other symptoms is generally supported by [D-13], but it does not justify the incorrect joint-pain statement.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the asked local symptoms and systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, headaches) and attempts to provide the requested negatives. However, the incorrect handling of joint pain reduces how well it addresses the question."

  "summary": "The response is mostly on-topic and correctly notes fever and headache denial, but it contains a major error about joint pain (it was denied) and omits several key local details including the lack of bullseye rash and other site descriptors."
