  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately lists reported symptoms (dry cough worsening over 3 days, fever ~100-101°F on Friday, fatigue, decreased appetite, possible loss of taste, mild runny nose, uncertain SOB) and explicitly denied symptoms (sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, skin changes/rashes, GI issues like diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool, N/V, urinary changes, dizziness/fainting, confusion/memory loss; vision/hearing fine; swallowing uncertain). Generated Answer correctly identifies dry cough, fever, and fatigue but misrepresents uncertain SOB as reported 'harder time breathing,' omits decreased appetite/loss of taste/runny nose, incorrectly claims no explicit denials for chest pain/sore throat/chills/GI despite clear 'No' responses (e.g., P-13, P-14, P-19, P-22, P-23), and hallucinates unrelated knowledge graph/asthma link; significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers core reported symptoms cough/fever/fatigue (~50% of reported: misses appetite/taste/runny nose); partially lists some asked/denied symptoms (chest pain, heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, partial GI, N/V) but omits many (wheezing, sputum/blood, skin/rashes, urine changes, dizziness, confusion, vision/hearing) and fails to affirm denials; overall ~30-40% coverage of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded with citations (e.g., cough P-1/P-5/P-12 equivalent, fever P-1/P-2, fatigue P-1/P-8/P-25); however, misinterprets P-8 SOB as affirmative rather than uncertain, wrongly asserts no explicit denials despite direct 'No' from P (P-6,7,13,14,19,22,23 etc.), and fabricates knowledge graph/asthma diagnosis link not in transcript; multiple inaccuracies and hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response into reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and doctor-asked symptoms, addressing the question's two parts despite errors in denial identification and extraneous asthma mention; minor off-topic element but mostly focused."
