  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's explicit statement on ruling out COVID-19 due to overlapping symptoms [D-52] and identifies loss of smell as the characteristic symptom [P-24], matching the Gold Answer. It lists a core subset of symptoms (persistent headache [P-3], cough [P-11/P-12], nausea/vomiting/diarrhea [P-1/P-28/P-32]) that align with the transcript and Gold's constellation, but omits specifics like 'dry' cough [P-12], fatigue [P-19], and pertinent negatives, representing minor discrepancies while keeping core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Covered: Doctor's suspicion and quote [D-52]; symptom combination including headache, cough, GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea); loss of smell as characteristic [P-24]. Missed: Specific 'dry cough' [P-12]; fatigue [P-19]; doctor's query on smell/taste [D-24]; alternative viral illness [D-52]; pertinent negatives (no fever/chills [P-18], no runny/stuffy nose [P-23], no aches [P-27]). Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript: symptoms from [P-1], [P-3], [P-12] (cough, implied dry), [P-24], [P-28], [P-32]; doctor's statement [D-52]. Citations are accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses both parts of the question—specific symptom combination for COVID suspicion and characteristic symptom (loss of smell)—with structured response and no off-topic content."
