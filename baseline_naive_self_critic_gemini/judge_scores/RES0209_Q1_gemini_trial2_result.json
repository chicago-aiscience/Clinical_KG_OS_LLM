  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It explicitly states the patient did not confirm chest tightness, but the transcript shows the patient confirmed it in [P-20]. It also claims the patient did not provide a specific count for nighttime frequency, whereas the patient specifically stated it happens 'every other day' or 'every two days' in [P-18]. It also misses the two-week duration of the cough mentioned in [P-13].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific two-week duration of the cough, the fact that wheezing occurs more often than medication use, the confirmation of chest tightness (which was specifically asked for in the prompt), and the specific frequency of nighttime symptoms (every 1-2 days).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript in two specific areas: it claims the patient did not confirm chest sensations and did not provide frequency counts, both of which are present in the provided text. It also references an external 'Knowledge Graph' not provided in the context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it attempts to answer all parts of the question, including cough character, breathing difficulty, wheezing, and frequency comparison, though it fails to provide the correct details for several of these categories."
