  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the medication (Tylenol) and the symptom (headache). It also accurately lists the doctor's recommendations for medications and supportive measures. However, it contains a minor error in citation: it cites [P-1] for the use of Tylenol, but [P-1] only lists symptoms; Tylenol is first mentioned in [P-3].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer, including the home medication, the doctor's OTC recommendations (antipyretics, NSAIDs), and supportive measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, isolation). It misses the doctor's order for a COVID-19 swab test and the patient's self-initiated hydration efforts mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical claims are grounded in the transcript. The instruction to isolate, the specific dietary/rest advice, and the medication suggestions are all found in section [D-52].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses each part of the multi-part question without including extraneous information."
