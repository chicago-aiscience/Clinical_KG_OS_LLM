  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer: it correctly places cough onset on Wednesday evening as a mild/dry cough (P-1), notes fatigue by Thursday (P-1), and identifies fever first appearing on Friday with temperature just over 100°F (P-1, P-2). It also correctly mentions decreased appetite (P-15). A minor inaccuracy/over-interpretation is the statement that the mother “speculated he might be having a harder time breathing due to inactivity” (P-8); the transcript reflects uncertainty about possible shortness of breath because he hasn’t been active, not that inactivity caused breathing difficulty. No major contradictions to the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) cough first appeared Wednesday evening (2) fatigue by Thursday (3) fever emerged Friday and measured ~100.1–101 (4) decreased appetite by Friday. Missing or under-specified elements: (a) Thursday cough progression (“a bit of a cough” and “a little bit worse”) is not clearly stated; the answer jumps from onset Wednesday to worsening Friday, weakening the “day-by-day severity over three days” requirement. (b) Additional Friday symptoms in the Gold Answer are omitted: mild runny nose (P-16) and suspected decreased taste/lack of interest in breakfast (P-17). (c) The explicit correction from “5 days” to “3 days” (P-4) and the parent’s stepwise summary (P-12) are not mentioned.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate citations (P-1, P-2, P-15). The inclusion of the shortness-of-breath speculation (P-8) is loosely grounded but slightly reframed beyond what was said (causal phrasing “due to inactivity”), making it a minor faithfulness issue. No major hallucinated symptoms or timelines are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested day-by-day evolution (Wednesday through Friday), including cough onset, worsening, fever emergence, and some systemic symptoms (fatigue, appetite). The brief mention of possible breathing difficulty is a small tangent but still related to symptom evolution."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and on-topic, but it omits several Gold Answer details (Thursday cough worsening, runny nose, suspected taste change, and the explicit 3-day clarification), reducing completeness."
