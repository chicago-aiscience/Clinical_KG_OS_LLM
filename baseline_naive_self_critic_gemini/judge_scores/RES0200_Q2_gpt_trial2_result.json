  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The medication list is partially correct (Ventolin and Spiriva inhalers; atorvastatin).\nHowever, the answer is factually wrong about Ventolin frequency: the transcript explicitly states the patient used Ventolin “almost like 10 times this past week” [P-12], contradicting the generated claim that no numerical frequency is provided.\nIt is also incomplete/partly incorrect about the discontinued medication: the patient specified a prior blood-pressure medication that was a “diuretic” [P-35] and explicitly said they stopped it without the doctor’s approval [P-36]. The generated answer only says “blood pressure medications” and does not identify the diuretic or the lack of physician approval.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Ventolin, (2) Spiriva, (3) Ventolin use ~10 times in past week, (4) atorvastatin for cholesterol, (5) previously prescribed diuretic for BP, (6) stopped it without doctor approval.\nGenerated answer includes: (1) Ventolin, (2) Spiriva, (4) atorvastatin.\nMissing/insufficient: (3) the quantified Ventolin use; (5) that the BP med was a diuretic; (6) that the patient stopped it without physician approval. Overall ~40–50% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: it claims no numerical Ventolin frequency is given, directly contradicting [P-12].\nIt also cites [P-33] as support for taking atorvastatin, but [P-33] only establishes high cholesterol; the medication is stated in [P-38].\nNo major additional medications are hallucinated, but the key unfaithful claim about Ventolin frequency is substantial.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked items (current meds, Ventolin use, discontinued medication) with only minor extra framing. However, it fails to actually provide the requested Ventolin frequency and does not clearly answer which specific medication was stopped without approval, reducing practical relevance."

  "summary": "The answer is on-topic and identifies some medications, but it misses/incorrectly denies the documented Ventolin usage (~10 times in the past week) and fails to specify the discontinued diuretic stopped without physician approval."
