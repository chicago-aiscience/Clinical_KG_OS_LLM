  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies the patient's living situation with family as the 'specific potential exposure event identified by the patient.' In the transcript (P-18), the patient explicitly identifies a hiking trip where people 'brushed by' them as the only potential source, stating 'other than that I don't see where else I could have gotten this from.' The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms (anosmia, ageusia, cough) but fails on the core factual identification of the exposure event.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses the primary exposure event (the hiking trip) and the detail about people brushing by the patient. It fails to mention that the patient specifically discounted other sources of exposure. It covers the symptoms and the general COVID-19 connection but misses roughly 70-80% of the specific narrative details regarding the exposure history provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misrepresents the transcript. While the patient does live with family (P-29), the claim that the patient 'identified' this as the exposure event is a hallucination that contradicts the patient's actual statement in P-17 and P-18, where they deny known contact with sick individuals and point to the hiking trip instead.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly attempting to answer both parts of the prompt (the specific event and the connection to the diagnosis). It remains focused on the question, even though the content provided is factually wrong."
