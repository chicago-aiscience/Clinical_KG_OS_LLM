{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer on the core elements: working diagnosis of a viral infection/common cold; supportive care with hydration and OTC medication like Tylenol Cold; COVID swab ordered with results expected in ~48 hours; and guidance to isolate at home and await further public health instructions. No statements directly contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) diagnosis = most likely viral infection/common cold, (2) supportive care = hydrate + OTC Tylenol Cold, (3) COVID swab done today with results in 48 hours, (4) isolate at home/not see anyone, (5) further instructions from public health after results.\nKey point missing vs Gold Answer: the explicit expectation-setting that symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve and that there is “not much” beyond supportive care for a viral infection.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly grounded in [D-39]. Minor extrapolation: framing supportive care specifically as “while waiting for test results” is implied but not explicitly stated as the rationale in the transcript. The mention of a “knowledge graph” is not from the transcript but does not add clinical content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested items (diagnosis, supportive care, test ordered, and public health/isolation guidance) and does not introduce unrelated management steps."
