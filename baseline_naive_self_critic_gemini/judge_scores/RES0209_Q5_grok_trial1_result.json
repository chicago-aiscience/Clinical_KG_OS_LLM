  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the patient's triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) and family history (sister with asthma) from the transcript, matching the Gold Answer's identification of these elements. It correctly links them to the exacerbation via increased bronchodilator use and symptoms. However, it introduces factual discrepancies by referencing a non-existent 'knowledge graph' [KG] to validate triggers, distinguishing pollen solely as an allergy trigger (while Gold treats it as an asthma trigger prompting allergy suspicion), and implies support for 'diagnosis' despite the patient being previously diagnosed (P-2). These are minor to moderate errors, with core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: three triggers with citations (P-9, P-11), family history of sister's asthma (P-32), relation to exacerbation via symptoms and increased inhaler reliance. Partially covered: pollen leading to allergy suspicion (mentions doctor's suspicion but lacks clinician's 'that would make sense' [D-13] and revisit [D-31]). Missed: no other triggers (P-10), precise inhaler escalation from every two weeks to 5-6x/week (P-8), clinician's suggestion of medication change for better control (D-43), and rescue-only insufficiency. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about patient symptoms, triggers, and family history are verifiable with accurate citations (e.g., P-9, P-11, P-32). However, multiple references to a 'knowledge graph' [KG] confirming triggers or linking pollen to allergies are not in the transcript, constituting hallucinations. Additional claim that triggers 'support the diagnosis of asthma' ignores prior diagnosis (P-2).",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses how triggers and family history relate to the exacerbation (symptoms, increased inhaler use) and doctor's allergy suspicion (via pollen), structuring explanations around these elements with a summary table. Minor tangent from [KG] references, but remains focused on the question."
