  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemia) and the specific symptom findings cited by the doctor in the transcript (D-36), matching the core facts of the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary evidence mentioned by the doctor in his concluding assessment: the distinction between tightness and pain, and the lack of classic exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath). However, it misses the additional 'absent symptoms' highlighted in the Gold Answer, specifically the patient's denial of anxiety, sweating, and feelings of impending doom (the 'cardiac red flags').",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript. The citations [D-36] and [P-1] are accurate and relevant to the claims made.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: identifying the condition and explaining the evidence (nature of complaints and absent symptoms) used to deprioritize it."
