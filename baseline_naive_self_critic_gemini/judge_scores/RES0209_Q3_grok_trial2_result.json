  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness) as classic for asthma and notes bronchodilator relief and increased usage, aligning with the Gold Answer's core facts; however, it has minor discrepancies like vague citation of bronchodilator frequency increase (misses exact 'once every two weeks to five or six times per week' from P-8), inaccurately attributes chest tightness confirmation to P-16 instead of P-20, omits asthma history (P-2, D-3), triggers (P-9, P-11), and crucially the infection screening negatives that differentiate from a new condition.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: symptoms (dry cough P-1/P-14, SOB P-1/P-19, wheezing P-15, chest tightness D-20/P-20) and bronchodilator increase/relief (P-1/P-8 partially). Missed: confirmed asthma diagnosis since age 8 (P-2/D-3), specific usage escalation details (P-8), wheezing more frequent than inhaler use (P-17), exercise/cold triggers (P-9/P-11), comprehensive infection rule-out (P-21-P-28), reversible obstruction emphasis, and need for med adjustment (D-43). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptom claims verifiable in transcript (e.g., dry cough P-1/P-14, SOB P-1/P-19, wheezing P-15, chest tightness P-20, increased use P-1/P-8); however, heavily hallucinates a 'clinical knowledge graph' (KG) with specific links like '[dry cough --RELATED_TO--> asthma]' not present anywhere in transcript, misquotes D-19 ('copping your wheezy'), and loosely interprets P-16 for chest tightness. Multiple hallucinated elements undermine grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by explaining how the specified symptoms plus increased bronchodilator use indicate worsening asthma via symptom-medication links; minor tangent with irrelevant KG but stays focused without off-topic content."
