  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the three main factors mentioned in the Gold Answer: family history (father's heart attack in his 50s), smoking history (attempting to quit, reduced from 10 to 5 cigarettes daily), and psychosocial stressors (Masters thesis pressure, living alone, anxiety). All key facts align with the Gold Answer, though some citations are formatted differently and some extraneous details are added (like references to a 'knowledge graph' not in the source material).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major elements from the Gold Answer: (1) father's heart attack in his 50s with ongoing cardiac care, (2) smoking history with specific quantities and difficulty quitting, (3) thesis deadline stress and anxiety, (4) the patient's explicit connection of symptoms to stress and heart concerns, and (5) her nervousness and breathing changes during episodes. However, it omits the detail about the paternal grandfather dying young in an accident with unknown cardiac history, and doesn't mention her history of teenage anxiety attacks potentially returning.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations to specific exchanges (P-8, P-13, P-15, P-19, etc.). However, it introduces problematic references to a 'knowledge graph' that doesn't exist in the source material (e.g., 'According to the knowledge graph, smoking contributes to chest pain'). This constitutes mild hallucination, though the core claims about smoking risks are medically accurate and contextually appropriate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with the patient's heart disease concern. It provides specific transcript evidence for each factor and explicitly discusses their interplay. The structure follows the question's framework closely, though some sections on 'self-medication' introduce minor tangential content about treatment attempts rather than focusing solely on the concern about heart disease."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the three main contributing factors to the patient's heart disease concern with appropriate transcript citations. It covers most key points from the Gold Answer including family history, smoking behavior, and psychosocial stressors, along with their interactions. However, it loses points for: (1) introducing non-existent 'knowledge graph' references that constitute mild hallucination, (2) omitting some details about the grandfather's history and returning anxiety attacks, and (3) including minor tangential content about self-medication. Despite these issues, the answer remains substantially correct, complete, and relevant to the clinical question."
