  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment that asthma recurrence is the top differential (phrased as 'suspects recurrence,' aligning with 'might be your asthma reoccurring' and 'top of the differential' in Gold and transcript). It correctly notes cardiac ischemia is lower due to symptom profile (no pain, tightness over SOB on exertion per doctor's paraphrase), which is consistent with Gold's implication and D-36. Physical exam (lungs), first-step treatment (rescue puffers trial), and contingency (reassess if no help) match Gold precisely. Minor rephrasing but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: assessment as asthma top differential (yes); phys exam - quick exam and lung auscultation (yes), though misses explicit 'consider further investigations depending on findings'; first-step intervention - rescue puffers trial during walks, noting patient lacks them (yes); contingency - if no improvement, revisit other directions/investigations, stepwise (yes, though misses 'one thing at a time' and consult with supervising doc phrasing). Covers ~90% of key points, missing minor details like pending findings caveat and physician consult.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: asthma suspicion [D-35]; cardiac lower [D-36]; symptom distinction (tightness not SOB/exercise pain) [D-36, patient's reports]; history [P-1]; phys exam [D-35]; rescue trial [D-35]; contingency [D-35]. Patient lacks rescue confirmed [P-17,P-18]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to mirror question: overall assessment, phys exam components, first-step treatment, contingency approach. No tangents or off-topic content."
