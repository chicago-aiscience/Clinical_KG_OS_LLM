  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor did not provide concluding remarks or a management plan, whereas the transcript explicitly shows the doctor stating a plan in [D-33] ('pass it on to the doctor who'll take a look at you'). It also incorrectly claims the dialogue ends earlier than it does. However, it correctly identifies some clinical details like the family history and stress triggers.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to address the first half of the question regarding the stated plan. Regarding clinical information, it misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including the duration of symptoms (1.5 weeks), the duration of episodes (20 minutes), the failure of OTC medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), and several pertinent negatives (no fever, no asthma, no trauma).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations. It references a 'Knowledge Graph (KG)' that is not present in the source transcript or Gold Answer. It also falsely claims the transcript segments provided do not include concluding remarks, despite [D-33] being present in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it attempts to summarize the clinical information gathered, it fails to answer the primary requirement of identifying the stated plan at the end of the consultation."
