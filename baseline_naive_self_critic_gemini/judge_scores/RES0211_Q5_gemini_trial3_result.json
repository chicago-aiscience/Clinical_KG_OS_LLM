  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by stating that the father's allergies, cousin's asthma, farm living, and homeschooling are 'not mentioned' in the source text. In reality, these are explicitly mentioned in turns P-33, P-30, P-43, and P-41 respectively. While it correctly identifies the brother's cold and Jessica's symptoms, the premise of the answer is fundamentally flawed.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover the majority of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the synthesis regarding intra-household transmission in an isolated environment and the significance of the cousin's asthma/father's allergies in establishing a family history of atopy, because it incorrectly claimed these facts were missing.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a high degree of unfaithfulness by claiming that information present in the transcript is absent. This is a 'negative hallucination' where the model fails to perceive provided data.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. It addresses the general symptoms and the brother's cold, but it dismisses the specific inquiry regarding the farm, family history, and homeschooling, which were the central components of the prompt."
