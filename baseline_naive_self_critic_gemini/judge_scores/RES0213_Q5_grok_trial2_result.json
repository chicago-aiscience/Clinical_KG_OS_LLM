  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details family history including father's heart attack 'last year' in 50s, ongoing heart doctors [P-8, P-30], unknown grandpa history; smoking specifics (started 18, 10/day for 2 years, now 5/day, hard to quit [P-13,14,18]); stressors (thesis pressure [P-15,16], living alone [P-26,27], nervous running [P-28]); connections (stress possible [P-8], nervous breathing [P-19], past anxiety [P-22]). Generated covers core family scare [P-8], smoking quit difficulty [P-13], thesis stress [P-15, P-19], but misses specifics like 'last year'/heart docs/grandpa/smoking timeline/living alone/running/past anxiety; adds interpretations like genetic risk (plausible but not emphasized in gold), smoking as 'physical trigger' (not in gold/transcript). Minor discrepancies, core facts consistent. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: family dad 50s/scares her; smoking trying to quit hard; stressors thesis nervous/breathing; connections to worry/heart thing. Missed: dad 'last year'/heart doctors; grandpa accident; smoking start age/amounts/timeline; living alone/nervous running; past anxiety attacks; fuller stress details. Covers ~70% of gold's specifics and points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Citations [P-8,13,15,19,6,D-18] accurate to transcript. Hallucinations: 'knowledge graph' (twice, not in transcript); smoking as 'physical trigger for chest pain' (not stated); 'stress contributes to chest pain' via graph; 'doctor raises smoking early' (D-18 mid-convo); self-medication proves 'not merely psychogenic' (interpretive leap). Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated claims. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the three specified factors (family/smoking/stressors), their contributions/interactions with heart disease concern, with transcript details. Minor off-topic: knowledge graph, self-medication interpretation. Score: 4."
