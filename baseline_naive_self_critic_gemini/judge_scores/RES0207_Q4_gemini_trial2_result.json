  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three main categories of differential diagnoses (Cardiac, Infectious, GI). However, it misses the most direct symptoms the doctor used to screen for cardiac issues (chest pain and syncope/fainting), instead attempting to link gastrointestinal symptoms to cardiac events. The Gold Answer more accurately pairs chest pain and faintness with the cardiac differential.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses approximately 50% of the specific symptoms and exposures mentioned in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits chest pain, feeling faint, runny nose, sputum production, contact with sick individuals, and travel history. It captures the GI symptoms and some URI symptoms but lacks the comprehensive list found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript in terms of the symptoms it does include, with accurate citations for those specific points. It does not hallucinate symptoms not present in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for symptoms, exposures, and differential categories."
