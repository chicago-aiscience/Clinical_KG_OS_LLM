{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The local symptom description (redness, tenderness, soreness) matches the transcript and Gold Answer. However, the Generated Answer incorrectly states the patient “reported” joint pain rather than denying it; in the transcript the doctor asks about “other joint pain” [D-7] and the patient answers “No” [P-7]. This is a major error because the question explicitly asks which screened systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, headaches) the patient denied.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer local symptoms include: location/crease behind left knee; tick “stuck pretty good”; localized skin soreness (not the joint); redness and tenderness; denial of bullseye/target rash; otherwise well. Generated Answer only includes redness/tenderness/soreness and omits the location/crease detail, “stuck pretty good,” explicit “skin not joint,” and the denial of bullseye rash. For systemic screening, it correctly includes fever and headaches denied but fails on joint pain (states the opposite). Overall it covers less than ~80% of key points and contains a key omission/error regarding the systemic negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: the claim that the patient reported joint pain contradicts [P-7]. The answer also uses local soreness as evidence of joint pain, which the patient explicitly distinguished as skin soreness “not the joint itself” [P-1]. Other elements (fever/headache denials) are supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the asked local symptoms and the screened systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, headaches). There are no major tangents, though the incorrect handling of joint pain reduces usefulness."
