  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies asthma recurrence as the top differential, accurately describes the physical examination plan (lung auscultation), properly states the rescue inhaler recommendation, and correctly outlines the contingency approach. The cardiac ischemia discussion is appropriately characterized as lower on the differential. No contradictions or factual errors are present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components from the Gold Answer: (1) assessment of asthma recurrence at top of differential, (2) physical examination plan including lung auscultation, (3) rescue inhaler trial as first intervention, and (4) contingency to reassess if treatment fails. However, it omits some details present in the Gold Answer: the doctor's plan to consult with the supervising physician ('the doc'), the specific mention that patient currently lacks rescue puffers, and the explicit 'one thing at a time' stepwise approach phrasing. The answer is approximately 85-90% complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The assessment is from D-35, physical exam plan from D-35, treatment recommendation from D-35, and contingency from D-35/D-36. The cardiac ischemia discussion accurately reflects D-36. No hallucinated facts are present. Citations are accurate and appropriate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three components of the question: overall assessment (asthma recurrence), physical examination components (lung auscultation), treatment intervention (rescue inhalers), and contingency approach (reassess if no improvement). The cardiac ischemia discussion, while not explicitly requested, is relevant context for understanding the differential diagnosis. No irrelevant content is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-structured response that covers all major components of the clinical plan. It correctly identifies asthma recurrence as the primary assessment, accurately describes the physical examination and treatment intervention, and properly outlines the contingency approach. The answer is highly faithful to the source material with appropriate citations. Minor details such as consultation with supervising physician and the explicit stepwise approach phrasing are omitted, preventing a perfect completeness score, but the core content is comprehensive and correct."
