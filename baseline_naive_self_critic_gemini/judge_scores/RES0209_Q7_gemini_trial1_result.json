  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain information about the patient's diagnosis at age eight or their baseline bronchodilator usage of once every two weeks. These facts are explicitly stated in the transcript (P-2 and P-8). Consequently, the core premise of the answer—that this data is missing—is factually wrong compared to the Gold Answer and the source text.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover approximately 50% of the requested evolution. It focuses only on the current exacerbation while completely omitting the historical context (diagnosis age and baseline frequency) that was specifically requested in the prompt. It also misses specific quantitative data about current use (5-6 times per week).",
    "faithfulness": "While the description of current symptoms is grounded in the transcript, the explicit assertion that the transcript 'does not include historical context' is a hallucination of absence (a failure to retrieve existing information). This makes the response unfaithful to the provided source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer only partially addresses the prompt. It ignores the 'evolution over time' aspect requested by the user, choosing instead to focus solely on the current status while incorrectly stating the historical part cannot be answered."
