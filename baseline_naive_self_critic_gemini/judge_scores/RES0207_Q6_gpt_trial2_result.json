  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect compared with the Gold Answer and the transcript. The transcript clearly includes end-of-visit next steps in D-37: the clinician says they will review the information with “the doctor who's working today,” then “come back shortly” to discuss next steps, including whether to do tests and how to move forward. The Generated Answer incorrectly claims no next steps were communicated and that the conversation ends around P-26, which directly contradicts the provided transcript (which continues through D-38).",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer’s key points are: (1) clinician will review the case with the doctor working today (shared decision-making/another physician involved), (2) clinician will return shortly to discuss next steps, (3) possible tests may be ordered, (4) plan to determine how to move forward, (5) no specific tests/treatments were ordered yet, and (6) courteous closing. The Generated Answer covers essentially none of these; it instead asserts there were no next steps mentioned. Thus it misses nearly all required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not grounded in the transcript. It fabricates/incorrectly asserts that the consultation ‘ends abruptly while the patient is speaking’ and that there are no subsequent doctor turns after D-22/P-26, despite the transcript explicitly containing D-37 and D-38 with the next-step plan. This is a major unfaithfulness to the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic (it attempts to address whether next steps and follow-up actions were communicated), but it does so by incorrectly denying what is present in the transcript and includes irrelevant meta-commentary about missing segments. Overall it remains largely focused on the asked elements, despite being wrong."
