  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main Lyme features the clinician screened for: erythema migrans/bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/feeling ill, and headaches. It is broadly consistent with the Gold Answer that these were assessed and were absent/denied. Minor issues: it treats reviewing the Ontario Lyme distribution map as a “diagnostic test,” whereas in the Gold Answer it is contextual risk assessment rather than a diagnostic test; it also does not clearly state the patient’s explicit denials for fever/headache (it notes they were assessed, but not that they were absent), though the transcript does contain explicit denials. The rash citation leans on [P-3] (patient saying it didn’t look like the prior target rash) rather than the clearer denial at [P-6], but the statement itself remains consistent with the encounter.",
    "completeness": "Key absent clinical features in the Gold Answer: (1) no erythema migrans/bullseye rash, (2) no joint pain, (3) no fever/illness, (4) no headaches, (5) generally feeling well otherwise, (6) no other bites found. The Generated Answer covers (1)-(4) but misses (5) “feeling well otherwise” and (6) “no other bites.”\nProposed evaluation/tests in the Gold Answer: (a) physical exam of bite site, (b) tick sent to lab for definitive species ID, (c) blood work/serology (“titres”), plus plan to consult supervising physician. The Generated Answer includes (b) and (c), but omits (a) physical exam and the planned physician consult, and adds the distribution map item (which is not a diagnostic test in the Gold Answer). Overall this is ~50–79% coverage of Gold Answer points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (questions about rash, joint pain, fever/illness, headaches; plan to send tick for identification; plan for bloodwork/serology; mention of the Ontario distribution map). However, referencing a “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript, and presenting the distribution map as a diagnostic test is a mild reframing beyond the Gold Answer. No major hallucinated clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on (1) absent clinical features of active Lyme disease assessed in the visit and (2) proposed evaluation/testing. The inclusion of the Lyme distribution map as a ‘diagnostic test’ is a minor tangent/misclassification but still related to Lyme risk assessment."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and on-topic, capturing the main symptoms screened for and key proposed lab evaluations, but it misses several Gold Answer elements (feeling well/no other bites, physical exam, physician consult) and slightly misclassifies the risk map as a diagnostic test."
