  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main respiratory symptoms actually reported: (1) cough for ~4–5 days and described as dry/non-productive, and (2) runny nose for a couple of days with “pretty clear” discharge. It is also accurate that the patient denied sore throat. Minor issues: it does not explicitly state the transcript’s clarification that no sputum/“gunk” was produced (though it does label the cough non-productive), and it frames the cough as “lack of improvement” rather than explicitly “stayed the same” (largely consistent, but not as precise as the Gold Answer).",
    "completeness": "It captures the core symptoms (cough and runny nose) and the discharge appearance (clear), but it misses several Gold Answer details: explicit denial of bringing up sputum/“gunk,” the course of the cough (“stayed the same”), the patient’s comment about not having had a dry cough like this before and that prior runny noses didn’t last this long, and other pertinent negatives included in the Gold Answer (e.g., chest pain denial, no wheeze/SOB with activity per mother).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references (duration and nature of cough; runny nose duration and clear discharge; sore throat denied). However, the added “knowledge graph” assertions (e.g., runny nose ‘associated with’ cough; classification statements attributed to a knowledge graph) are not supported by the provided transcript and are therefore unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked respiratory symptoms and their characteristics (cough type and nasal discharge appearance). Inclusion of sore throat denial and knowledge-graph relationship statements is slightly tangential to the question, but not severely off-topic."
