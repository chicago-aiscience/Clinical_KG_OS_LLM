  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and omissions. It states the patient denied nausea/vomiting at D-17/P-19, when actually P-17 is the correct denial. It claims the patient denied stiff neck at D-18/P-19, when P-18 is correct. Most critically, it completely misses the most important constitutional symptoms screened: night sweats (D-5/P-5), unexplained weight loss (D-6-8/P-6-8), and hemoptysis (D-10/P-10). It also omits all exposure risk screening (sick contacts, travel, IV drug use). The claim that 'night sweats were not explicitly screened for' is factually incorrect - they were explicitly asked about at D-5.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 40% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It identifies only 3 minor screening questions (chest pain, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck) while missing the most critical ones: night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis, sick contacts, travel history, and IV drug use. It fails to explain why these specific symptoms are TB red flags or mention the classic TB triad. The exposure risk screening section is completely absent.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains multiple citation errors. It attributes P-19 to questions answered at P-17 and P-18. It falsely claims night sweats were 'not explicitly screened for' when D-5 directly asks about them. However, the claims it does make (about chest pain, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck) are verifiable in the transcript, just with incorrect citations. The TB mention is appropriate but lacks grounding in the specific screening pattern.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address both parts of the question (symptoms screened and conditions excluded) but does so incompletely. It correctly focuses on TB as a serious condition to exclude and explains the relevance of constitutional symptoms. However, by missing the most important screening questions, it fails to fully address what was actually screened for in this encounter."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question but contains critical factual errors and major omissions. It identifies only minor screening questions while missing the most important constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis) and completely omits exposure risk screening (contacts, travel, drug use). Citation errors are present throughout, and it falsely claims night sweats were not screened for when they explicitly were. While it correctly identifies TB as a concern and explains the general relevance of constitutional symptoms, the incomplete coverage and factual inaccuracies significantly undermine its clinical utility. The answer covers less than 40% of the Gold Answer's key points."
