  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the assessment of the bullseye rash, joint pain, systemic symptoms (fever), and headaches as absent features. It also accurately lists the proposed tests: tick identification and blood work (serology), as well as the review of the distribution map mentioned in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most of the key points but misses a few details found in the gold answer. Specifically, it omits the mention of the physical examination as a proposed test, the absence of other bites on the patient/husband, the patient's general well-being ('feeling fine'), and the planned consultation with a supervising physician. It covers approximately 60-70% of the discrete points mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript. The citations [D-6], [D-7], [D-8], [D-13], [D-18], and [D-19] are used correctly and correspond to the relevant sections of the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and exclusively addresses the two parts of the question: the clinical features assessed and found absent, and the diagnostic tests proposed. There is no irrelevant or off-topic information."
