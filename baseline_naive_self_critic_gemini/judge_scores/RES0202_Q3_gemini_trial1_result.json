  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the transcript does not document a change in taste, whereas turn [P-17] explicitly records the parent wondering if the child is losing his sense of taste. Additionally, the generated answer states the symptoms lasted 'five days' based on the doctor's question in [D-3], failing to note that the parent corrected this to '3 days' in [P-4]. The gold answer correctly identifies both the taste symptom and the 3-day duration.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover the 'change in taste' component of the question's required symptoms, explicitly dismissing it. It does cover the cough and fever symptoms and explains the doctor's reasoning for concluding an infectious process (differentiating from asthma via fever), but misses the specific triad requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the absence of information. By stating 'the transcript does not document that symptom' regarding taste, it contradicts the source text where turn [P-17] clearly addresses the parent's concern about a loss of taste.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to address the specific parts of the prompt, even though it provides incorrect information regarding the presence of certain symptoms."
