  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the patient did not explicitly state 'no' to inquiries, whereas the transcript shows the patient explicitly said 'no' or 'nope' to almost every negative symptom (P-4, P-6, P-7, P-14, P-16, etc.). Additionally, it fails to mention that the character of the discharge was 'mostly clear', which is the primary descriptive character provided by the patient.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two key points from the Gold Answer and the prompt: 1) It fails to identify 'post-nasal drip' as a denied symptom, even though it was explicitly mentioned in the prompt's examples. 2) It fails to mention the discharge was 'mostly clear'. It also omits the temporal progression (stuffy at first, then running) and the positive finding of fatigue.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates or misinterprets the patient's responses by stating they did not use the word 'no'. This contradicts the source transcript where 'no' is used repeatedly by the patient in response to symptom screening.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure, addressing the specific symptoms, character, and denied symptoms requested, though the content within those sections is flawed."
