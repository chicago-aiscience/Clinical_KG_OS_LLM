  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details cough as first symptom 4-5 days prior, dry/non-productive, unchanged severity, runny nose 2-3 days later, novel dry cough and longer runny nose vs prior. Generated correctly captures cough duration (despite minor citation error to P-5 instead of P-2/P-4), relative timing (cough first, runny nose couple days), persistence/not improving, clear runny nose. However, it omits novelty of dry cough and specifies prior runny noses were shorter (P-24), instead focusing on asthma family history which is accurate but shifts emphasis; no direct contradictions but minor discrepancies in emphasis and completeness of prior comparison.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: cough 4-5 days first (yes), dry/non-productive (cited but not explicitly stated), severity unchanged/persistent (yes), runny nose couple days later (yes), clear (yes). Missed/partial: explicit sequential progressive pattern summary, prior 'never had dry cough like this' and 'runny noses never lasted this long' (P-24) - instead only asthma hx; healthy otherwise implied but not stated. Covers ~70-80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with citations (e.g., durations P-2/P-11, persistent P-2, clear P-12, denials various P, asthma P-28). Minor citation inaccuracy (P-5 for duration, actually dry confirmation) but no hallucinations or fabricated facts; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom timeline, relative timing/duration of cough vs runny nose, cough severity changes (persistent/same), and prior comparison (though partial). Minor tangent in listing unrelated symptom denials (sore throat etc.) and asthma details, but core focus matches question."
