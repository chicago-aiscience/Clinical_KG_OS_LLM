  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that symptoms began about two weeks prior, started with flu-like/URI symptoms, that other symptoms resolved within ~3–4 days, and that the cough is now dry and persistent with occasional chest soreness. However, it contains a clinically meaningful timeline error: it states the productive phase lasted only “first two or three days” and implies the cough became dry when other symptoms resolved, whereas the transcript specifies whitish/clear mucus for the first 4–5 days and transition to dry after day 4–5 [P-6]. It also omits/does not accurately report key facts about cough intensity and frequency stability (and the quantified frequency).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) ~2-week duration, (2) early flu-like symptoms with resolution by day 3–4, (3) cough became dry and persisted, (4) cough-related chest soreness, (5) no fever and no SOB/GI symptoms (partially). Missing or insufficient: (1) mucus appearance (“whitish clear”), (2) correct duration of mucus (4–5 days), (3) explicit sore throat duration (2–3 days), (4) explicit runny nose timeframe, (5) cough intensity stayed the same over 2 weeks, (6) cough frequency stayed the same and estimate 3–4 times/hour, (7) spontaneous/no triggers, (8) COVID test negative at onset and stayed home. Overall, it captures well under ~80% of the Gold Answer timeline detail.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or are incorrect relative to the transcript: productive cough lasting only 2–3 days contradicts [P-6] (4–5 days). The answer also references a “knowledge graph” and cites “[KG]”, which is not part of the provided transcript and therefore is not verifiable. Some citations are also loosely applied (e.g., referencing doctor prompts like [D-11], [D-12] to support patient-confirmed negatives).",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (symptom progression and cough course), but it fails to address important aspects explicitly requested in the question (mucus appearance/duration, intensity and frequency changes) and includes some tangential symptom negatives not central to the asked timeline. Still, most content relates to symptoms over time."
