  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer regarding the father's cardiac history and the patient's anxiety. However, it hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' as a source and states that smoking is a 'physical trigger' for the pain, which is not explicitly stated in the transcript (though it is a known risk factor).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several specific details found in the gold answer: the grandfather's accidental death, the specific smoking statistics (started at 18, 10 cigarettes per day reduced to 5), the fact that she lives alone, her nervousness about running, and the specific mention of teenage anxiety attacks returning.",
    "faithfulness": "The citations provided are mostly accurate and grounded in the text. However, the repeated mention of a 'knowledge graph' is a hallucination as no such document was provided in the context.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address the tripartite nature of the question (family history, smoking, and stressors) and their interactions."
