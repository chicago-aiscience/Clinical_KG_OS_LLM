  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the physical exam, laboratory tests (tick ID and blood work), antibiotic treatment, physician consultation, and preventive advice (insecticide and surveillance).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers nearly all key points. It misses the specific descriptive detail of the ticks making a 'waving motion with their legs' included in the gold answer's preventive advice section. It also omits the specific justifications for antibiotics (Strathroy geography and 72-hour timeframe), though it mentions 'timeframe' and 'risk assessment' generally.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and the provided citations are accurate (e.g., D-18 for the physical exam and insecticide advice).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address the multi-part question regarding diagnostic tests, treatments, consultations, and preventive advice."
