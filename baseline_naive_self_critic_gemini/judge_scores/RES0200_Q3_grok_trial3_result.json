  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (worsening cough with citations [P-1, P-5], sputum changes [P-6], increased dyspnea [P-1, P-5, P-8]) matching the Gold Answer, and correctly quotes the doctor's linking in [D-52]. Minor discrepancies include citing COPD history as 'couple years ago' from [P-1] instead of the corrected five years [P-2], slight misphrasing of sputum as 'clear to yellow' previously (patient said clear to white), and omission of inhalers [P-11]. Core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key Gold points: worsening cough [P-1,P-5], sputum changes [P-6], dyspnea [P-8], COPD history, doctor's synthesis [D-52]. Misses specific mention of inhalers [P-11] and exact five-year history duration, but addresses 90+% of content including the specific symptom combination and linking.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom claims and citations ([P-1,P-5,P-6,P-8,D-52]) are directly verifiable in transcript. Sputum color slightly misquoted but close. However, references to 'knowledge graph' and specific associations (e.g., [SYMPTOM] cough --[ASSOCIATED_WITH]--> [DIAGNOSIS] copd exacerbation) are not in transcript, representing hallucinated external content.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the question's specified symptoms (worsening cough, sputum changes, dyspnea), COPD history, and doctor's explicit linking via [D-52] quote. Knowledge graph addition is a minor tangent but does not derail focus."
