  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All statements made in the Generated Answer are consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer: sudden shortness of breath on waking [P-1], seizure the previous night with known epilepsy [P-8], and a measured temperature of 37.4 [P-5]. It does not introduce incorrect or contradictory facts; the main issue is omission of additional respiratory detail (cough), which affects completeness rather than factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) sudden shortness of breath on waking; (2) seizure last night and underlying epilepsy; (3) objective fever measurement 37.4. Key points missed: (1) cough also began suddenly that morning [D-2, P-2]; (2) cough described as dry with no sputum [D-4, P-4]; (3) context that temperature was checked that morning and in degrees Celsius (and described as mild) [P-5, P-6]. Overall it captures the neurological symptom and fever measurement but only partially captures respiratory symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript: SOB [P-1], seizure/epilepsy [P-8], temperature 37.4 [P-5]. No hallucinated symptoms or measurements are added.",
    "relevance": "The answer is tightly focused on the asked elements (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptom, fever measurement) with no extraneous content. While incomplete on respiratory symptoms, what is provided is directly relevant."
