  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and omissions. It correctly identifies chest pain, nausea/vomiting, and stiff neck screening, but completely misses the critical constitutional symptoms that were actually screened: night sweats [D-5], unexplained weight loss [D-6, D-7, D-8], and hemoptysis [D-10]. It also fails to mention any of the exposure risk screenings (sick contacts at D-14, D-15, D-32; travel history at D-33, D-34; IV drug use at D-40). The closing statement incorrectly claims night sweats were 'not explicitly screened for' when they clearly were at D-5. These are major factual errors as these are the most important TB screening questions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It identifies only 3 of the constitutional symptoms screened (chest pain, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck) but misses the most critical ones (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis). It completely omits all exposure risk screening questions (sick contacts, travel history, IV drug use). It does not mention the doctor's closing summary at D-47. The answer addresses only a small portion of what was asked.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a significant hallucination. It states that night sweats 'were not explicitly screened for by the doctor in the provided text,' when in fact the doctor clearly asks at D-5: 'OK, have you had any night sweats? You wake up, the sheets are soaked?' and the patient responds at P-5: 'Uh no, not that.' This is a direct contradiction of what appears in the transcript. The other claims about chest pain, nausea/vomiting, and stiff neck are verifiable in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it attempts to address what was screened and what conditions would be excluded. However, it focuses on less clinically significant screening questions (nausea, vomiting, stiff neck) while completely missing the classic TB screening triad (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis) and all exposure risks. The discussion of TB exclusion is superficial and based on incomplete information. The answer addresses the question's structure but misses most of its substance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors and omissions. It correctly identifies three minor screening questions but completely misses the critical constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis) and all exposure risk screenings (sick contacts, travel, IV drug use) that are central to TB screening. Most problematically, it falsely claims night sweats were not screened for when they clearly were at D-5/P-5. The answer covers less than 50% of the Gold Answer's key points and contains a significant hallucination, though it maintains some relevance to the question's general topic."
