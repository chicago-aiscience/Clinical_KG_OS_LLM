  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states onset 3 days ago first noticed on walk [P-4], just came on no trigger [P-3], staying the same/steady [P-2,P-3], always there baseline worse on walk/chair/big breath [P-9,10], inspiration [P-1,5], reduced walks from couple to one [P-22]. Generated correctly notes 3 days [P-1], always there/tight on breathe in [P-1,P-9], exacerbators walking/chair/deep breath [P-1,P-9,D-10]. Errors: does not specify first noticed precisely on walk (implies association), calls progression 'persistent but intermittent' vs Gold/transcript 'staying same/steady'; major error claiming 'maintains normal daily walking routine' contradicting Gold/transcript reduced to one walk [P-22]; hallucinates KG; minor misattr doctor note. Significant factual errors/contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3-day onset [P-1], first on dog walk [P-4], no trigger [P-3], staying same [P-2,3], baseline always worse walk/chair/breath [P-9,10], inspiration [P-1,5], reduced walks couple to one [P-22], no work miss [P-21,22], noticeable limit [P-22,23]. Covered: 3-day onset, always baseline, inspiration, exacerb walk/chair/breath. Missed/wrong: first precisely on walk, no trigger, 'staying same', reduced walks (says maintains normal), work/noticeable limit. Covers ~50-60% accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: 3 days [P-1], always there [P-9], breathe in [P-1], walk exacerbate [P-1,P-9,D-10], chair/breath [P-9]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'intermittent' (transcript 'always there' baseline), 'Knowledge graph data [KG]' fabricated no KG/transcript basis, 'maintains normal routine' contradicts [P-22] reduced walks, misattributes 'doctor notes tries every day' (patient [P-1]). Multiple hallucinated/misinterpreted facts.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around onset/development, progression, exacerbating activities, impact on routine, perfectly matching question elements (development/evolution 3 days, first activity, better/worse/same, exacerbators, walking routine effect) with no off-topic content."
