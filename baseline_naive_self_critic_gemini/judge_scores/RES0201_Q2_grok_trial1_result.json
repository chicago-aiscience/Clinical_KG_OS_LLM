  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the long-acting beta agonist for COPD (matching Gold [P-28, P-27]) and the self-treatments of salt water gargling and painkillers with no relief (matching Gold [P-6]). It does not contradict any facts but omits vitamins ([P-30]), confirmation of only medications ([D-29, D-30]), no allergies ([P-31]), and substance use details from Gold. Additions like mono history ([P-5]) and COVID suspicion ([D-43]) are accurate to transcript but not emphasized in Gold. Core facts are correct with minor discrepancies: score 4.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: COPD chronic condition, LABA medication, self-treatments (salt water, painkillers, no efficacy). Missed: vitamins, doctor confirmation of only meds, no allergies, substance use (smoking history, alcohol, no cannabis/drugs). Covers approximately 60% of key points (core meds and self-treatments but misses supporting details): score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All specific claims (LABA [P-28], self-treatments [P-6], mono [P-5], COVID suspicion [D-43], COPD context [P-27]) are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. 'Knowledge graph' and placeholders ([MEDICAL_HISTORY], [SYMPTOM], [DIAGNOSIS]) are minor unverifiable phrasing but do not fabricate facts; content remains grounded: score 4.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses ongoing prescription (LABA) and self-treatments for sore throat as per question. Sections 1-2 perfectly focused; Section 3 (mono history, suspected COVID) introduces minor tangents not central to medications/treatments: score 4"
