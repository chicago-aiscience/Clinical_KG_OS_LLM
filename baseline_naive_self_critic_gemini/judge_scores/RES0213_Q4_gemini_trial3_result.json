  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the points it mentions (shortness of breath and anxiety history), which align with the transcript. However, it focuses more on symptoms or history than the broader clinical conditions identified in the Gold Answer (e.g., musculoskeletal injury, infectious illness, or inherited arrhythmia syndromes).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly incomplete. It covers only 1-2 of the 6 distinct clinical screening areas mentioned in the Gold Answer. It misses the screening for traumatic/musculoskeletal injury, infectious/febrile illness, asthma, and inherited arrhythmia syndromes. It covers approximately 30% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. The citations [D-19, P-19, D-21, P-20] are correct and the interpretations of the patient's responses are grounded in the text without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the question by identifying conditions screened for and the lines of inquiry used. However, by omitting the majority of the doctor's screening process, it provides a limited perspective."
