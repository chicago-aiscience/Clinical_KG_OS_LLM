  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer categorizes COPD exacerbation symptoms as increased dyspnea [P-1], increased cough frequency [P-1], increased sputum volume [P-1], and decreased exercise tolerance [P-4]; infection symptoms as green-yellow sputum [P-1], possible fever [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12], mild headache [P-14], and sick contact [P-20]. Generated correctly identifies doctor's assessment [D-43], some COPD symptoms (increased cough, sputum volume, dyspnea from [P-1]), and green-yellow sputum for infection [P-1], with sinus pressure [P-12]. Minor discrepancies: includes blood-tinged sputum as COPD symptom (present in [P-1] but not emphasized in Gold), misses fever/headache/sick contact/exercise tolerance/patient history [P-3]/excluded triggers; adds 'bacterial component' interpretation plausible but not directly from Gold. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: doctor's quote [D-43]; COPD sym (dyspnea, cough freq, sputum vol [P-1], exercise tol [P-4]); infection sym (sputum, fever [P-9], sinus [P-12], HA [P-14], contact [P-20]); distinguishing role of sputum/fever; patient pattern [P-3]; excluded triggers [P-26,P-38]; no obj findings [D-43]. Generated covers: doctor's quote; partial COPD sym (cough, sputum vol, dyspnea [P-1]); partial infection (sputum [P-1], sinus [P-12]); sputum distinguishing. Misses: exercise tol, fever, HA, contact, patient history, excluded triggers, no obj findings (~60% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: symptoms/quotes from [P-1,D-43,P-12] accurate. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph' (absent from transcript); 'purulence/pus/bacterial component' (plausible medically, not stated); sinus as 'systemic/upper resp infection' (inferred); blood under COPD (present but not doctor-linked); distinguishing non-infectious exac examples (env explored [D-38,P-38], cardiac not). Some plausible inferences, minor fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists symptoms supporting dual assessment with citations; explains green-yellow sputum's role in distinguishing infection trigger (though omits fever, adds sinus); structured around question; minor extras like blood/KG but focused on query."
