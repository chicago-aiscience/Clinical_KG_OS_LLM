    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures baseline manageability with puffers [P-1], acute worsening over 3 days with increased cough, green-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, and dyspnea [P-1], and prior ED visits without admission [P-5]; however, it omits explicit progression details [P-2], severity comparison as 'worst ever' [P-3], lifestyle management [P-28], inhaler frequency [P-26], exercise tolerance specifics [P-4], and fever [P-9], while adding minor extras like sinus pressure [P-12] and doctor's suspicion [D-43], resulting in minor discrepancies but core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: baseline puffers [P-1], 3-day symptom worsening (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea) [P-1]; partially covers prior ED visits [P-5]; missed: lifestyle management [P-28], rescue inhaler once/2 weeks [P-26], dog walks routine now trickier [P-4], possible fever [P-9], explicit 'getting worse/not better' [P-2], 'worst that I've had' [P-3], prior sickness-triggered exacerbations [P-3]; covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: baseline/symptoms [P-1], ED history [P-5], sinus [P-12], doctor's suspicion [D-43]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details, interpretive phrases like 'significant decompensation' grounded in patient's reports.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses baseline to acute evolution over 3 days and worsening implication; partially covers severity comparison via prior ED mentions but misses explicit 'worst'; minor tangents on sinus pressure and doctor's diagnostic plan [D-43] slightly off-focus from symptom evolution question."
