  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition from [D-45], matching the Gold Answer. It accurately quotes the doctor's statement on the hypothetical scenario (cough or shortness of breath without fever) and attributes exclusion to the presence of fever, citing [P-1], [P-2], and [D-3]. Minor discrepancy: references fever duration as 'five days' per [D-3], but parent corrects to ~3 days in [P-4]; Gold specifies temp values (over 100°F, 101, 100.1°F). Core facts fully align, no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: condition (asthma, [D-45]), hypothetical presentation (cough/SOB without fever), excluding finding (fever with citations), shift to infection ([D-45]). Misses Gold's specifics on temp values, supporting details (no wheezing [P-7], uncertain SOB [P-8]), and nuance (not permanently ruled out, prioritized febrile infection). Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript: asthma and quote from [D-45], fever from [P-1]/[P-2], duration mention in [D-3]. Slight paraphrase of quote is faithful. No hallucinations; 'knowledge graph' mention is extraneous but not fabricating content from transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by identifying asthma and fever as excluding finding, with direct quotes and citations. Structured response (condition, hypothetical, excluding finding) is focused, no tangents."
