  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several significant factual errors. It states mucus production lasted 2-3 days when the Gold Answer correctly identifies 4-5 days [P-6]. It incorrectly claims sore throat and runny nose resolved in 3-4 days during the productive phase, when actually these symptoms resolved in 2-3 days for sore throat [P-13] and 3-4 days for flu symptoms generally [P-14], but mucus production continued until day 4-5. The answer fails to distinguish the different timelines for different symptoms. It also doesn't mention the whitish-clear appearance of mucus or provide the specific cough frequency (3-4 times per hour).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details from the Gold Answer: (1) the specific whitish-clear appearance of mucus, (2) the precise 4-5 day duration of productive cough, (3) the 2-3 day timeline for sore throat specifically, (4) the cough frequency of 3-4 times per hour, (5) that cough has no identifiable triggers/is spontaneous, (6) COVID test timing and negative result, (7) patient being home awaiting resolution before work return. It covers approximately 50-60% of the key points with incorrect timelines for several items.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript but contains interpretation errors. The claim that mucus lasted 'first two or three days' contradicts [P-6] which clearly states 'first four or five days'. The answer incorrectly groups symptom resolution timelines together when the transcript provides distinct timelines for different symptoms. It does accurately cite the transition to dry cough and lack of current symptoms, but the timeline inaccuracies represent misrepresentation of transcript content rather than hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about symptom timeline progression. It attempts to cover initial symptoms, mucus production, cough transition, and ongoing status. However, it provides an incomplete and partially inaccurate timeline. The structure is relevant but the execution has significant gaps in covering the complete two-week timeline as requested, particularly regarding intensity/frequency changes over time."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to provide a timeline but contains significant factual errors in symptom duration, particularly stating mucus production lasted 2-3 days instead of the correct 4-5 days. It misses critical details like mucus appearance, specific cough frequency, and COVID test information. While the answer is relevant and mostly grounded in the transcript, the timeline inaccuracies and incomplete coverage of key points result in a response that provides only partial value for understanding the complete symptom progression."
