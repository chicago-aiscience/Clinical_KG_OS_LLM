  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It states that the doctor did not explore the patient's living situation, workplace, travel history, or sick contacts, but the transcript explicitly shows the doctor asking about all of these: living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48], travel [D-49], and sick colleagues [D-50].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. While the Gold Answer details the specific responses for living situation, environment, work, and travel, the Generated Answer incorrectly claims these topics were never addressed.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails faithfulness because it claims there is 'no evidence in the provided text' for questions that are clearly present in the transcript. This is a negative hallucination (denying the existence of information that is present).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it directly attempts to answer the specific question asked about exposure sources, though it provides the wrong information."
