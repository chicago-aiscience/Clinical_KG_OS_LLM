  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor's assessment and plan as described in the transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 symptoms, the diagnostic tests (swab and chest X-ray), and the isolation protocols (immediate and conditional). It matches all factual details found in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers almost all key points of the Gold Answer. It identifies the assessment, the two specific tests, the initial isolation period, and the condition for continued isolation (remaining symptomatic despite a negative test). It slightly misses the context mentioned in the Gold Answer regarding the doctor consulting with a supervising physician/colleague ('the document' in the transcript, interpreted as 'doctor' in Gold) as a next step, but it addresses all specific parts of the user's prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically from section [D-43]. There are no hallucinations or external clinical assumptions not present in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all components of the multi-part question without including unnecessary information."
