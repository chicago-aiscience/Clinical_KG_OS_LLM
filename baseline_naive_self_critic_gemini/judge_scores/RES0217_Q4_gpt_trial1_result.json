  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most clinical features and proposed diagnostics align with the Gold Answer: erythema migrans/bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/illness, and headaches were all assessed in the transcript and are correctly reported as absent. Tick speciation and Lyme serology (“titres/serology”) are also correctly identified as proposed tests. Minor issues: the answer cites the patient’s confirmation about the rash using [P-3] (where the patient compares it to a prior episode) rather than the clearer denial at [P-6]; it also lists reviewing a Lyme distribution map as a ‘diagnostic test,’ which is more risk stratification than diagnostic testing. These are relatively minor and do not overturn the main clinical facts.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: absence of bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/illness, headaches; proposal to send the tick for species identification; proposal for blood work/serology.\nKey points missed: (1) proposed physical exam of the bite site; (2) explicit note that the patient felt well otherwise; (3) confirmation of no other bites/exposures on self/husband; (4) plan to consult a supervising physician before finalizing. Inclusion of the distribution map does not compensate for missing diagnostic/assessment elements. Overall coverage is partial (~60–75%).",
    "faithfulness": "The content is largely grounded in the transcript. However, there are small faithfulness concerns: mention of a “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript; framing the distribution map as a proposed diagnostic test is a reinterpretation; and some items are presented as assessed-and-absent without explicitly stating the patient’s denial (though the denial is present in the transcript). No major hallucinated clinical findings or tests beyond these minor points.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on the asked-for elements (absent clinical features and proposed tests). The distribution map item is slightly tangential to ‘diagnostic tests’ (it’s epidemiologic context rather than a test), but still related to evaluating Lyme risk. Overall, it addresses the question with minor drift."

  "summary": "The generated answer is mostly accurate and transcript-grounded, but it misses several Gold Answer elements (physical exam, ‘feeling well otherwise,’ no other bites, and supervision/consult plan) and slightly misclassifies the distribution map as a diagnostic test."
