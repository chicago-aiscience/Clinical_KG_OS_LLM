  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and notes a COVID test was used, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript ([P-35]). However, it is incorrect about timing: the patient explicitly says the test was done when symptoms first started about two weeks ago ([P-36]), whereas the Generated Answer states it was done “during this prolonged period of symptom persistence,” which contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer. Workplace concern is partially correct (coworkers scared when patient coughs [P-35]) but omits key occupational context (hospital clerk role, infection-control implications, and desire to return to work without coughing).",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) Condition ruled out = COVID-19; (2) Test = COVID test; (3) coworker fear when coughing. Missed/incorrect: (1) exact timing relative to symptom onset (test at onset ~2 weeks prior); (2) patient works as a hospital clerk; (3) PPE/heightened hospital infection-control context; (4) patient has stayed home and is eager to return but doesn’t want to be coughing when returning; (5) workplace/social-professional pressure in a hospital environment beyond coworker fear. Overall, it captures less than half of the Gold Answer’s key details and includes a major timing error.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript for COVID-19, “covid test,” and coworker fear ([P-35]). The statement about timing (“conducted during this prolonged period of symptom persistence”) is not supported and conflicts with the explicit transcript statement that it was done at symptom onset ([P-36]). The use of [P-13][P-14] to justify timing is a misapplication (those lines discuss symptom course, not when the test occurred).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements (condition ruled out, test, timing, and workplace concerns). However, the timing component is answered incorrectly and workplace concerns are only partially addressed."
