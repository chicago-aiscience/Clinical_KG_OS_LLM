  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the details it provides. It correctly identifies the duration of the cough (3 months), its intermittent nature, the 'greenish' sputum, chest pain only when coughing, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and the impact on exercise. These points align perfectly with the gold answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer. Specifically, it fails to mention the patient's report of subjective fevers ('feeling hot at night'). More significantly, it omits most of the symptoms the patient explicitly denied, including night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis (blood in sputum), foul smell, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts. The gold answer contains a much more comprehensive list of these negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. Every claim made is supported by specific patient quotes and correct turn references (e.g., [P-2], [P-9], [P-19]). There is no hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is directly relevant to the question, addressing the respiratory symptoms, sputum characteristics, and denials. However, the 'denials' section is under-developed compared to the prompt's requirement for 'which symptoms did she explicitly deny'."
