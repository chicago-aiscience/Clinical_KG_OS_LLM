  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains mostly correct information but has one factual error regarding the onset of diarrhea. The Gold Answer states diarrhea began 'about two days ago' [P-28], while the Generated Answer incorrectly states it began '4 days ago.' All other facts (dry cough, 4-day onset of cough, liquid stools, 5-6 episodes daily, 2 vomiting episodes, persistent headache, 7/10 severity) are consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers several key points but omits significant information from the Gold Answer. It correctly includes cough nature (dry), diarrhea frequency (5-6 times daily), vomiting episodes (2), and headache severity (7/10). However, it omits: pertinent negatives (no sputum/blood in cough, no shortness of breath, no wheezing, no chest pain, no blood in stool, no bloating, no constipation), headache location (forehead/top of head bilaterally), lack of neck radiation/stiffness, unusual nature of headache for patient, loss of smell, fatigue, and vomiting characteristics (food contents, no blood). Coverage is approximately 40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is largely grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, there is one significant error: claiming diarrhea began '4 days ago' when [P-28] clearly states 'probably like 2 days ago.' This represents a misrepresentation of the transcript data. The reference to knowledge graph information in the opening statement is also unexplained and potentially fabricated as no knowledge graph was provided. Most claims are verifiable but this error reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by systematically covering respiratory symptoms (cough nature), gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea frequency, vomiting episodes), and headache characteristics (severity). The structure mirrors the question's components. However, it could be more comprehensive in describing 'specific characteristics' as requested, particularly regarding the headache location and other distinguishing features mentioned in the Gold Answer."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a structured response addressing the main symptom categories but has notable limitations. It correctly identifies the dry cough, liquid stools occurring 5-6 times daily, 2 vomiting episodes, and 7/10 headache severity. However, it contains a factual error about diarrhea onset (stating 4 days vs. actual 2 days) and omits substantial detail including pertinent negatives, headache location specifics, and associated symptoms like loss of smell and fatigue. The answer is relevant and mostly grounded in the transcript but lacks the completeness and comprehensive detail present in the Gold Answer."
