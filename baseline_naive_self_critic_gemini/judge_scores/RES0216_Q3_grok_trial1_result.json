  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures core elements like the patient's history of asthma, presenting symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath on exertion, exclusion of cardiac ischemia due to lack of pain, and the doctor's proposal for a rescue inhaler trial, which align with the Gold Answer. However, it has minor discrepancies: it inaccurately implies current prescription and use of Salbutamol as rescue without noting non-refill (P-17/18), overlooks the key medication non-adherence (skipping evening dose, P-19; doctor's summary D-34), presents symptoms as 'mirroring' past asthma despite patient noting it feels 'different' (P-16), and adds hoarseness/phlegm as aligning with asthma without doctor linkage.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: history of asthma (partial, wrong citation), symptoms of diffuse tightness worsened by exertion/difficulty full breath (yes), absence of cardiac indicators (yes), therapeutic trial with rescue (yes). Missed or partially covered: medication limiting/non-adherence (skipping evening dose P-19, no rescue refill P-17/18, central to D-34), patient's acknowledgment it could be related despite difference (P-16), no environmental triggers (P-33). Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: symptoms [P-1,7,9,10], asthma history [P-16/29 though cited P-25], cardiac exclusion [D-36], rescue proposal [D-35]. Unverifiable/plausible additions: hoarseness/phlegm 'aligns with asthma' (P-11 mentioned but not doctor-linked to diagnosis), 'symptoms mirror previous asthma' (contradicts patient's 'feels different' P-16), 'harder to breathe contradicts cardiac' (loose, as D-36 notes tightness not typical SOB/pain). No major hallucinations but some interpretive stretches.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around presenting symptoms, medical history, clinical features, and doctor's linking/reasoning to asthma exacerbation as top differential, perfectly matching the question without off-topic content."
