  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts stated in the Gold Answer without any contradictions or errors. It correctly lists all laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG), imaging (chest X-ray), COVID swab, monitoring (oxygen saturation), and therapeutic interventions (supplemental oxygen if needed, continuation of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics). The only potential minor discrepancy is the tense ('was performed' for COVID swab vs. Gold's future implication), but this does not alter factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: all labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs), COVID swab, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring and supplemental oxygen if needed, continuation of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics. Missed/minor gaps: specific timeframe for COVID results (24-48 hours), explicit naming of Ventolin/Spiriva in continuation, and additional blood pressure monitoring from [D-37]. Covers approximately 85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript: blood work details, ABG, chest X-ray, COVID swab, oxygen saturation check and supplemental oxygen if needed, continuation of bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics. No hallucinations; minor tense shift on COVID swab ('was performed' vs. 'will do') is plausible in context but grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question, directly listing laboratory tests, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions for the COPD exacerbation plan with clear headings and citations, containing no off-topic content."
