{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer on the key management actions explicitly stated by the doctor: COVID swab testing with 24–48 hour turnaround, isolation for 14 days, isolating specifically from the younger sister if possible, and ER return precautions (high temperature, neurologic symptoms including seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). No contradictory or incorrect details are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer includes: (1) COVID swab + 24–48h results, (2) 14-day isolation, (3) isolate from younger sister, (4) ER precautions. It omits several additional management/context points present in the Gold Answer: acknowledgement of possible false-negative swab results, possibility of another circulating viral illness if swab negative, the plan to wait for swab results/observational approach, explicit note that no medications were prescribed/supportive care, and the school requirement for a COVID test to return. Overall this is a partial (not full) capture of the Gold Answer content.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are directly supported by the transcript (particularly D-44). No clear hallucinations or transcript-inconsistent claims are present.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question’s requested management measures (test, isolation instructions/duration, who to isolate from, and practical escalation criteria). It contains no meaningful tangents."
