  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual inaccuracies compared to the Gold Answer and transcript. It places the onset of the raspy cough on Sunday, whereas the transcript [P-3] and Gold Answer specify Friday. It states the fever began on Sunday, while the transcript [P-8] and Gold Answer specify Monday. It also fails to mention the runny nose that occurred a week prior to the consultation.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses key milestones: the runny nose (one week ago) and the specific Friday onset of the raspy cough. It also fails to detail the progression on Monday (persistence of blood-tinged sputum) and incorrectly groups symptoms into broad categories that obscure the day-by-day progression requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates Sunday as the start date for the fever, which contradicts the transcript's statement that it started Monday [P-8]. It also attributes the 'raspy cough' to Sunday despite the patient clearly stating Friday [P-3].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it attempts to provide a timeline and addresses the specific symptoms mentioned in the prompt (cough, sputum, fever, chills, chest pain). However, its relevance is undermined by the chronological errors."
