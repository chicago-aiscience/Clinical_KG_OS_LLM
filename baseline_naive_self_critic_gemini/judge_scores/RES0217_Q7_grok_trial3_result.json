  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline elements (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertainty of attachment, discovery due to soreness behind left knee, removal and bringing the tick) and comparison points (prior ~10-year-old bite with bullseye rash, antibiotics, more swollen tick vs. current smaller/less engorged tick, localized soreness without rash). Minor discrepancies include not specifying the exact knee crease location as precisely, omitting the doctor's >72-hour estimate [D-6], not explicitly stating the patient's hope that it was from hiking not gardening, and slightly imprecise citation of bullseye rash to [D-6] (which references patient's prior statement in [P-3]). No major errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: hiking Fri/gardening Sat [P-1], uncertainty/hope on source [P-1 partially], discovery earlier today due to soreness behind knee/red/tender [P-1], embedded/stuck [P-1], container [P-1], prior ~10yrs bullseye/abx/swollen tick [P-3], current small/little engorged/not as much [P-3/P-4], localized red/tender no larger rash [P-1/P-6 partially]. Missed/partial: doctor's 72hr estimate [D-6], doctor's engorgement confirmation/not grape [D-4], explicit 'earlier today', Strathroy location [P-12], full 'hope not garden' phrasing. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: timeline from [P-1], soreness/red/tender/stuck [P-1], container [P-1], prior experience details [P-3], current vs prior engorgement [P-3/P-4], localized symptoms [P-1/P-3/P-6]. Citations accurate ([P-1], [P-3], [D-6] appropriate as it references prior discussion). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; 'left leg' is consistent with knee location.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured perfectly around the question with dedicated 'Timeline of Tick Exposure' and 'Comparison of Current vs. Prior Tick Bite' sections, directly addressing exposure timeline (Fri-Sat-discovery-presentation) and symptom/engorgement contrasts without tangents or off-topic content."
