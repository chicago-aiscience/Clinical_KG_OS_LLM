  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to be ruled out, the swab test, the 48-hour turnaround, and the isolation instructions. It accurately reflects the transcript [D-39].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a few key points present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it does not explicitly state that *both* the patient and doctor identified the condition (as requested by the question), and it omits the instruction regarding 'further instructions from public health' and the phrase 'not see anyone else' mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript [D-39]. There are no hallucinations or external information introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question: the condition, the test, the turnaround time, and the instructions."
