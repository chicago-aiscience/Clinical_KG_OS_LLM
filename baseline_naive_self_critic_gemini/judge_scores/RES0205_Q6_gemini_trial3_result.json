  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect. It claims that the transcript does not contain the doctor's plan or physical examination components, but this information is explicitly stated in segment [D-37]. Furthermore, it falsely claims the transcript ends at [P-35], whereas the provided text continues to [P-38].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer missed all key points from the Gold Answer. It failed to identify the physical exam components (listening to heart and lungs) and the process for determining next steps (consulting with a supervising physician), both of which were clearly outlined in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends prematurely and that the requested information is missing. It contradicts the provided source text directly.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to answer the question asked, instead providing a false meta-commentary on the availability of information that was actually present in the text."
