  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the sputum color (yellow custard) and the presence of blood (spots of red). It correctly identifies the location of the chest pain (right side). However, it incorrectly attributes the 'raw' sensation described in the transcript [P-15] to the chest pain, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer clarify this refers to the throat after coughing. It also misses the specific 'dull' quality of the chest pain mentioned in [P-21].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer addresses the specific categories mentioned in the prompt (sputum, chest pain, systemic symptoms). However, it misses several key symptoms included in the Gold Answer: mild dyspnea on exertion [P-10, P-11], the sore throat itself [P-15], the history of a runny nose [P-16], and the pertinent negative of no weight loss [P-22]. It also lacks the detail regarding the fever being subjective/unmeasured.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, but it contains a clear misinterpretation/hallucination regarding the 'raw' quality of the chest pain. The transcript [P-15] is a response to a question about a sore throat, not chest pain.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the components of the question (sputum, chest pain, and systemic symptoms) without adding unnecessary information."
