  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer regarding the diagnosis, supportive care (hydration and Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (swab), and public health guidance (isolation and follow-up).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the specific categories requested in the prompt (diagnosis, supportive care, test, guidance). However, it misses the specific detail from the Gold Answer regarding the doctor's expectation that symptoms may take 'a few weeks' to resolve.",
    "faithfulness": "The clinical content is well-grounded in the transcript, specifically [D-39]. However, the response mentions a 'knowledge graph' in the opening sentence, which was not provided in the source context, representing a minor contextual hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, following the structured categories requested in the prompt and focusing exclusively on the doctor's management plan."
