  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It states the patient had 'complete loss' of taste, which directly contradicts the Gold Answer and transcript. P-4 clearly shows the patient could still taste 'really, really salty foods' but not normal things like banana - this is partial loss, not complete. The smell description is somewhat accurate but less detailed than warranted. The cough description is incomplete, missing key details about it being dry/non-productive and having no triggers.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 40% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) the two-day duration explicitly, (2) specific examples of what could still be perceived (very strong bad odors for smell, salty foods for taste), (3) the banana example, (4) consistency of symptoms over time, (5) non-productive nature with no sputum/blood, (6) cough starting simultaneously with sensory symptoms, (7) no identified triggers, (8) that cough remained consistent without worsening. It also incorrectly characterizes the degree of taste loss.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer has a major hallucination issue. It claims 'complete loss' of taste when P-4 explicitly states the patient could taste 'really, really salty foods.' This is fabrication contradicting the source. The citations are minimal and the claim about anosmia being 'partial' is supported, but the ageusia characterization is unfaithful to the transcript. The dry cough mention is accurate but incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is mostly relevant to the question, addressing sensory symptoms (smell and taste) and respiratory symptoms (cough) with some degree information. However, it fails to provide the detailed examples and perceptions that the question specifically requests ('what they could and could not still perceive'). The response is on-topic but superficial compared to what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the main symptom categories but contains a critical factual error by stating the patient had 'complete loss' of taste when the transcript clearly indicates partial loss (could taste very salty foods). It omits numerous important details including specific examples of remaining perceptions, symptom duration, consistency, and cough characteristics. The response lacks the depth and accuracy expected for clinical documentation, with significant gaps in completeness and a major faithfulness violation."
