  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition and the presence of fever as the clinical finding that excluded it, which perfectly aligns with the Gold Answer and the transcript [D-45]. It accurately quotes the doctor's reasoning regarding the hypothetical scenario (cough/shortness of breath without fever) and the current presentation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key components of the question: the condition (Asthma), the hypothetical presentation (cough/shortness of breath without fever), and the specific excluding finding (presence of fever). It also provides supporting temperature details from the parent's report. It captures almost all points of the Gold Answer, omitting only the minor supporting details about wheezing and the mother's uncertainty about shortness of breath.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It correctly cites [D-45] for the doctor's reasoning and [P-1], [P-2] for the temperature details. While it mentions the doctor's initial statement of a five-day duration [D-3], it reflects the transcript's dialogue accurately even if that specific number was later corrected by the parent.",
    "relevance": "The answer is entirely relevant to the question asked. It provides a direct response without unnecessary filler, though it does mention a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the provided context, but this does not detract from the relevance of the clinical content."
