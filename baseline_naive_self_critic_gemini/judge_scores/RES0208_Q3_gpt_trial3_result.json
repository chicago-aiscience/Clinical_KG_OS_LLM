  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor-cited constitutional symptoms supporting a general infectious process: fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches (matches D-36 and the Gold Answer). It also correctly identifies the symptoms the doctor used to justify not ruling out COVID-19: difficulty breathing plus emerging sore throat and cough (also matches D-36 and the Gold Answer). However, it adds that loss of taste supports COVID concern; while loss of taste is reported by the patient (P-4), the Gold Answer explicitly notes the doctor did not include loss of taste/smell in the D-36 assessment summary as the basis for COVID concern. This is a minor but real discrepancy from what the question asks (doctor’s assessment evidence).",
    "completeness": "Covers the key items from the Gold Answer: (1) general infection evidence = fevers, fatigue, muscle aches; (2) COVID-not-ruled-out evidence = difficulty breathing with sore throat and cough. It does not include the Gold Answer’s important clarification that taste/smell loss, though elicited, was not explicitly cited by the doctor in the assessment summary, and it omits the Gold Answer’s emphasis that the doctor focused on respiratory findings when explaining COVID concern.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript with correct attribution to D-36. However, references to being “supported by the knowledge graph” and “maps to the knowledge graph” are not present in the transcript. In addition, the statement implying loss of taste as part of the COVID reasoning is not faithful to the doctor’s D-36 summary (even though taste loss is in P-4, it was not cited by the doctor as rationale in D-36).",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked distinction (general infection symptoms vs additional symptoms preventing ruling out COVID). Minor irrelevant/extra content includes “knowledge graph” framing and bringing in loss of taste as COVID support, which is not part of the doctor’s stated assessment rationale in D-36."

  "summary": "Captures the doctor’s key cited symptoms for infection and COVID concern, but introduces non-transcript “knowledge graph” elements and adds loss of taste as COVID reasoning despite it not being cited by the doctor in the D-36 assessment."
