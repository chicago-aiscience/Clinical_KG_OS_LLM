  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptom progression (stuffy nose → fever + sore throat + muscle aches) and accurately notes the husband's week-long illness versus the patient's three-day fever. However, it lacks the precision of the Gold Answer in confirming specific temporal relationships (e.g., sore throat appearing 'just before' fever, muscle aches concurrent with fever over 2-3 days). The core facts align with the Gold Answer but miss nuanced confirmations from the dialogue exchanges (D-2/P-2, D-3/P-3, D-15/P-15).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main symptom sequence and timeline comparison but misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: (1) explicit confirmation that stuffy nose was first via doctor-patient exchange, (2) specific timing that muscle aches appeared over 'past two to three days' concurrently with fever, (3) the sore throat being 'still ongoing' and 'not going away', (4) the calculation that husband's illness began ~4 days before patient's fever, and (5) the clinical interpretation of staggered onset suggesting household transmission. Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The stuffy nose first [P-1], fever for three days [P-1], sore throat present [P-1], muscle ache mentioned [P-13], and husband's week-long similar symptoms [P-19] are all accurately cited. No hallucinated content is present. The answer appropriately uses bracket citations to support claims.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about chronological symptom progression and timeline comparison with the husband. It stays focused on the requested information without tangents. The structure follows the question's requirements, though it could be more detailed in explaining the temporal relationships."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate basic account of the symptom progression and timeline comparison, with all facts verifiable in the transcript and strong relevance to the question. However, it lacks the depth and precision of the Gold Answer, missing specific temporal confirmations from dialogue exchanges, exact timing details (2-3 days for muscle aches), the calculation of the 4-day offset between husband and patient, and clinical interpretation of household transmission patterns. The answer is factually sound but incomplete in coverage of nuanced details."
