  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It accurately captures the doctor's logic regarding the timeline (Friday/Saturday activities) and the 72-hour attachment duration, as well as the geographic risk assessment using the Ontario Lyme map.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers 100% of the key points found in the gold answer, including the specific activities, the attachment time calculation, the geographic location (Strathroy), and the doctor's justification for prophylactic antibiotics based on the map.",
    "faithfulness": "While mostly grounded, the answer includes an artifact not present in the transcript: '(supported by the knowledge graph indicating Strathroy is a [RISK_FACTOR] for Lyme disease)'. This appears to be a hallucination of external metadata or a processing tag, though it does not compromise the clinical accuracy of the response.",
    "relevance": "The response is perfectly focused on the two parts of the question, providing specific evidence for both the duration calculation and the geographic justification."
