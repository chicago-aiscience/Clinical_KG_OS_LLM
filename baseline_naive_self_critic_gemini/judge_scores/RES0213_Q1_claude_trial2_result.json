  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It incorrectly attributes 'several times a day' to D-18 when that exchange is about smoking history, not pain frequency. The response also mischaracterizes pain resolution, stating medications don't help and linking resolution to anxiety attacks, when the transcript clearly shows pain resolves when the patient is engaged with others or distracted [P-9, P-29]. The correct information is that pain goes away 'once I'm at school and like talking to people and doing other things' [P-9].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses critical information from the Gold Answer: (1) pain occurs specifically at rest [D-11, P-11], (2) pain resolves or goes unnoticed when engaged with others, talking to classmates, or doing hands-on tasks [P-9, P-29], (3) pain doesn't worsen with exercise [P-10], (4) no preceding injury [P-5], and (5) no prior occurrence before this episode [P-17]. The response covers quality, duration, and some occurrence situations but misses approximately 40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains hallucinated content. The statement 'pain occurs several times a day' attributed to [D-18] is false - D-18 discusses smoking. The claim about pain resolution being linked to anxiety attacks [P-20] misrepresents the transcript, which states heart fluttering happens with anxiety, not pain resolution. The accurate resolution pattern (pain goes away with social engagement/distraction) is completely omitted in favor of fabricated content about medication failure being the only attempted resolution.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about chest pain characteristics, quality, duration, and situations of occurrence/resolution. However, it provides incorrect information about resolution patterns. The structure is appropriate but approximately 30% of the content (resolution section) is off-target due to misinterpretation of the source material."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It contains major factual errors including misattribution of 'several times a day' to the wrong transcript section and mischaracterization of pain resolution. The response misses approximately 40-50% of key points from the Gold Answer, particularly the critical finding that pain resolves with social engagement and distraction. Faithfulness is compromised by hallucinated claims about resolution patterns linked to anxiety attacks, contradicting the actual transcript content. While the answer maintains structural relevance to the question, the combination of factual errors, incomplete coverage, and hallucinated content results in a below-average evaluation (2.5/5). The response would require substantial correction to accurately represent the clinical presentation described in the consultation."
