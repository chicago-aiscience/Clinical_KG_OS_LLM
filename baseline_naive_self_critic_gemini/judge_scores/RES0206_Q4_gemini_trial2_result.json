  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition to rule out (COVID) and the test ordered (COVID swab), matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript lacks information about social contacts or exposure history. In reality, the transcript [P-20] explicitly mentions the patient walking dogs with a friend who was sick and walking 'too close'.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers two of the three main components of the question (condition and test). It fails to provide the third component (social contact details), essentially missing one-third of the required information from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits a 'hallucination of absence' by claiming the transcript does not contain information about social contacts. This is directly contradicted by the text in segment [P-20], where the patient describes an exposure to a sick friend.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant as it explicitly attempts to answer all three parts of the prompt in a structured format, even though the content for the third part is incorrect."
