  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer cites transcript directly for symptoms (dry cough P-1/P-14, SOB P-1/P-19, wheezing P-15, chest tightness P-20), asthma history (P-2/D-3), bronchodilator relief/escalation (P-1/P-8), triggers (P-9/P-11), and infection screening negatives (P-14/P-21-P-28) to argue worsening asthma vs new condition. Generated Answer correctly identifies symptoms and escalation but introduces fictional 'clinical knowledge graph' (KG) relations (e.g., [dry cough --RELATED_TO--> asthma]) not in transcript or Gold, misattributes chest tightness to P-16 instead of P-20, and omits history, triggers, and infection ruling-out. Main point (worsening asthma) aligns, but significant discrepancies in evidence and method.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: classic symptoms (all 4 cited), diagnosis since age 8, reversible relief, exact escalation (once/2wks to 5-6/wk), wheezing > use, exercise/cold triggers, no infections/colds/contacts/etc/dry cough. Generated covers all 4 symptoms, general relief/escalation (not exact freq), but misses diagnosis confirmation, specific triggers, wheezing frequency detail, and entire infection screening (crucial for 'vs new condition'). Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verifies symptoms (P-1 dry cough/SOB, P-14 dry, P-15 wheezing, P-20 chest tightness), escalation (P-8: once/2wks to 5-6/wk), relief (P-1/P-16). However, entire KG framework and specific relations (e.g., [wheezy --RELIEVES--> bronchodilator]) are hallucinated/not verifiable in transcript. Misquotes D-19 ('copping your wheezy'), indirect chest tightness link. Multiple hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Question specifies exact symptoms + bronchodilator escalation pointing to worsening asthma vs new condition. Generated directly lists those symptoms, ties to asthma/relief/escalation, concludes worsening asthma. KG is extraneous method but content stays on-topic, no major off-topic digressions."
