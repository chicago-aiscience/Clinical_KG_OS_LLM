  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Nasal symptoms: Correctly identifies stuffy nose and runny nose, but omits the key evolution (stuffy first, then mostly runny) and duration (1 week).\n- Character of discharge: Incorrect/insufficient. The transcript explicitly states the discharge was “mostly clear” [P-5]; the Generated Answer does not mention “clear” and instead vaguely references “congestion and drainage,” which is not the discharge character.\n- Denied symptoms: Lists several true denials (cough, sore throat, SOB, fevers/chills, loss of taste/smell), but wrongly claims the patient did not explicitly say “no” (they did at [P-4], [P-7], [P-16]).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered vs missed:\n- Covered: stuffy nose; runny nose; denials of cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, fevers/chills, loss of taste/smell.\n- Missed: discharge described as “mostly clear”; denial of post-nasal drip/back-of-throat drainage (“just mostly for my nose”); timeline/details (1 week; initially on-and-off; stuffy first then mostly running); mild fatigue.\nOverall, it captures some major denials but misses multiple key nasal/discharge specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "- Some statements are not faithful to the transcript:\n  - Claims the patient did not explicitly state “no,” which contradicts multiple explicit “No” responses.\n  - Attributes characterization of discharge to the physician’s phrasing at [D-6] rather than the patient’s explicit description at [P-5].\n- The denied-symptom list is mostly consistent with transcript content, but the justification (“not reported and consequently not present”) is an inference and undermines grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked elements (nasal symptoms, discharge, denied associated symptoms). Minor irrelevant framing (“knowledge graph”) and includes extra non-target denials (headache/nausea/vomiting), but still mostly addresses the question."
