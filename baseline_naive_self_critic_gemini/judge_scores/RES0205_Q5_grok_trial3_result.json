  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer notes acid reflux managed by diet only without meds, potentially not fully controlled, as a known cough contributor; Generated covers history and diet management similarly but omits lack of meds. For hay fever, Gold highlights history of sensitivity but no current/active contribution; Generated asserts post-nasal drip as irritant, which overstates without transcript support for current symptoms. Occupational exposure: both note hospital work, PPE, but Gold emphasizes post-viral pattern while Generated stresses ongoing exposures and adds unverified 'Knowledge Graph.' Core facts consistent with minor discrepancies in nuance and over-attribution.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: acid reflux history/management and cough link (partial, misses no meds/'helped quite a bit'); hay fever history (but misses no current symptoms caveat); occupational exposure/PPE/carefulness (partial, misses post-viral emphasis). Gold's anxiety mention missed. Covers relations for all three main factors (~80-90%), but lacks some specific transcript nuances and post-viral context.",
    "faithfulness": "Patient facts verifiable (e.g., reflux [P-22,P-25], hay fever [P-27], hospital/PPE [P-17,P-34]). Citations accurate. However, clinical mechanisms (GERD irritation, post-nasal drip causality, hospital irritants) not in transcript but plausible externally. Hallucinations: 'Knowledge Graph' link entirely fabricated/not in transcript; assumes current post-nasal drip despite resolved symptoms [P-14]; minor error attributing fever/nausea resolution to [P-14] (fever denied [P-12], nausea [P-19]). Some unverifiable but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three specified factors (acid reflux, hay fever, hospital clerk exposure) explaining contributions to persistent cough outlasting other symptoms, with transcript citations and clinical summary perfectly on-topic, no tangents."
