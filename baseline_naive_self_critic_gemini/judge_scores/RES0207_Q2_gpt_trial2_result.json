  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states the patient is prescribed Keppra for chronic epilepsy and missed a dose due to a schedule disruption from their daughter’s birthday celebration (usually takes it with dinner; celebration earlier meant no usual dinner time). The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the medication name is not documented (it is: “Keppra” at P-23) and fails to identify the daughter’s birthday circumstance (P-24). It also adds a non-transcript reference (“[KG]”) and a general claim about adherence and seizures rather than the specific documented circumstance.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points: (1) Medication = Keppra (P-23). (2) Chronic condition = epilepsy (P-8). (3) Missed dose acknowledged (P-9). (4) Specific reason = daughter’s birthday/changed routine/earlier celebration and no dinner at usual time (P-24). (5) Miss likely contributed to seizure (P-9). The Generated Answer includes only (3) in a vague way and partially references epilepsy; it misses (1) and (4) entirely and does not capture the specific contextual details from P-24.",
    "faithfulness": "The transcript explicitly documents Keppra (P-23), so stating it is not documented is not faithful. The answer also introduces an unverifiable tag “[KG]” and a generalized statement about adherence precipitating seizures that is not directly stated in the transcript (though it is clinically plausible). Multiple elements are therefore not grounded or are contradicted by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to answer the two-part question (medication and circumstance) but provides an incorrect medication and an incomplete/non-specific circumstance, so it only partially addresses the question."
