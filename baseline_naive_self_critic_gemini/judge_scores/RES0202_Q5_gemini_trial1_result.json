{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is generally accurate but has a minor discrepancy regarding 'external contacts'. It states no other external contacts were 'mentioned', whereas the transcript shows the mother explicitly 'reported' that there were no sick contacts outside of school ('we know for sure'). The mention of the sister as a 'potential contact' is slightly confusing as she was described as healthy and was a contact to be protected, not a source of illness.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The mother's explicit confirmation that there were 'for sure' no sick contacts outside of school. 2) The detail about the school requiring a COVID test to return so they could inform other families of exposure. 3) The diagnostic exclusions (no travel, no home environmental issues) which the Gold Answer uses to explain why the source was narrowed down to the school.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is faithful to the transcript and provides correct speaker tags for the points it addresses. It does not hallucinate information, though it overlooks some specific details provided in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the main components of the question, including the school as a source, the status of sick contacts, and the lack of school notification."
