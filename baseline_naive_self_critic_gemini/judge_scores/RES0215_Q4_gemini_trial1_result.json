  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it claims that the questions and responses regarding fever, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, rashes, and phlegm were 'not captured in the provided transcript excerpts.' These are explicitly present in the transcript ([D-7/P-7], [D-8/P-8], [D-10/P-10], [D-11/P-11], [D-13/P-13], [D-31/P-31]). Because of this false claim, it fails to accurately explain how these specific symptoms helped narrow the differential diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer regarding the specific symptoms listed in the prompt. It does not explain that negative responses for fever, runny nose, etc., were used to rule out pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory infections, or contagious etiologies. While it mentions other factors (cold weather, activity triggers), these were not the primary focus of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer identifies some true details from the transcript (triggers and history), but it contains a significant 'hallucination of absence' by asserting that the requested screening questions were missing when they were the core of the provided text. This is a failure of grounding.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. It attempts to explain the diagnosis of asthma but dismisses the specific constraints of the question (the list of symptoms to analyze) based on the false premise that the data was unavailable."
