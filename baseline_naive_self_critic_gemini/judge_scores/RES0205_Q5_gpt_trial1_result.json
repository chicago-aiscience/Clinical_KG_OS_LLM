  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the general idea that GERD, allergic rhinitis history, and hospital work exposure can be relevant contributors to a persistent cough. However, it contains clear factual errors relative to the transcript/Gold: it states the patient had fever and nausea as part of the initial URI symptoms, but the patient explicitly denies fever [P-12] and nausea/vomiting [P-19]. It also overstates hay fever’s role by implying post-nasal drip as an active mechanism here, despite no transcript evidence of current allergy symptoms. The occupational exposure discussion is directionally reasonable, but adds unsupported claims (e.g., “constant respiratory irritants”) and a non-transcript ‘knowledge graph’ assertion.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold elements partially covered: (1) Acid reflux as a recognized cause of persistent cough is included, but the Gold’s point that the patient is not using medication for reflux and therefore may have incomplete control is not clearly stated. (2) Hay fever is mentioned, but the important Gold nuance—no current allergy symptoms described, so allergic contribution is not established—is missing. (3) Hospital clerk exposure risk and PPE use are mentioned. The post-viral pattern (other symptoms resolved in 3–4 days, cough persisted) is referenced. The anxiety/contextual motivation for seeking care (anxiety history and coworkers being scared) is only partially addressed (coworkers’ fear is mentioned, but anxiety history is omitted).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: fever and nausea as initial symptoms, active post-nasal drip as an explanatory mechanism, and especially the claim about a “Knowledge Graph” linking hospital/cough/PPE (not present in the transcript). These reduce faithfulness substantially even though some other details (dry cough, timing, negative COVID test, PPE use, chest soreness) are supported.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on relating acid reflux, hay fever, and hospital work exposure to the persistent cough, which directly answers the question. Minor tangents/unnecessary content (e.g., “Knowledge Graph”) do not dominate the answer."
