  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims there is no historical context or baseline data in the transcript, directly contradicting P-2 (diagnosis at age 8), D-3/P-3 (now 10), and P-8 (baseline once every two weeks vs. current 5-6 times/week). It partially describes current symptoms but with factual errors like misattributing wheezing to P-18 (actual P-15) and chest tightness to D-20 (actual P-20), and omits key progression details like wheezing frequency exceeding bronchodilator use (P-16/17). Core evolution is misrepresented as unknowable when fully stated in transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: diagnosis at 8/now 10 (2-yr history), baseline well-controlled (once/2 wks, triggers exercise/cold/seasons), 2-wk exacerbation (nonstop dry cough, increased wheezing/SOB/chest tightness, bronchodilator 5-6x/wk, wheezing > usage, nighttime every other day, no precipitant). Generated covers ~30%: some current symptoms (cough/SOB/wheezing/chest tightness), triggers (cold/exercise/pollen), increased usage vaguely; misses diagnosis/baseline specifics, evolution timeline, nighttime symptoms frequency, no-precipitant screening.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple hallucinations: denies historical data despite P-2/P-8; invents 'knowledge graph' not in input; wrong citations (wheezing [P-18] vs. P-15; chest tightness [D-20] vs. P-20; symptoms frequency [P-18] misused). Some claims grounded (e.g., current cough P-1, triggers P-9/11, SOB P-1), but unverifiable 'marked increase compared to baseline' without quantifying P-8 baseline.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on temporal evolution (diagnosis -> baseline -> current exacerbation with specific frequencies); Generated dodges evolution by claiming insufficient data, then shifts to partial current status analysis with tangents (e.g., symptom clusters, efficacy), partially addressing current phase but ignoring progression."
