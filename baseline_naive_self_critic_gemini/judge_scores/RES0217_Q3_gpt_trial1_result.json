  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the key reasons the clinician gave for prophylaxis: (1) uncertain exposure timing after hiking Friday and gardening Saturday, (2) clinician’s estimate that attachment could be >72 hours, (3) geographic risk near Strathroy per an Ontario Lyme map, and (4) prior tick bite with bullseye/target rash treated with antibiotics. Minor issue: it adds an interpretive claim of “known susceptibility (prior reaction),” which is not explicitly stated in the transcript and slightly over-interprets the prior Lyme-like episode as “susceptibility.” Otherwise consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers most Gold Answer elements: exposure history, uncertain timing/possible prolonged attachment, geographic risk assessment, and prior bullseye rash/antibiotic treatment. It omits two supporting points present in the Gold Answer: (a) the patient’s statement that people are considering ‘all ticks in this area’ as possible Lyme carriers, despite not looking like a deer tick, and (b) the doctor’s plan to send the tick for lab identification (and the broader “safer than not” framing). Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. The only notably weakly grounded element is the phrasing that the patient had “known susceptibility,” which is an inference rather than something stated. No major hallucinations or contradictions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by explaining the combination of exposure history, estimated attachment duration, geographic risk, and prior bullseye-rash history that led to recommending prophylactic antibiotics despite lack of deer-tick appearance and no current rash. No meaningful tangents."
