  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC products the patient tried for chest discomfort (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and accurately reports their limited benefit (“hasn’t really helped very much”), consistent with [P-6]. It does not introduce any factual inaccuracies; it is mainly incomplete rather than incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include: (1) Tylenol, (2) Advil, (3) Alka-Seltzer tried for pain, (4) all were ineffective/“haven’t really helped very much,” (5) daily multivitamin as the only regular supplement, and (6) no other medications/prescriptions. The Generated Answer covers (1)-(4) but omits (5)-(6) and also does not include additional contextual items mentioned in the Gold Answer (stress management/running; smoking reduction). Overall this is roughly about half of the Gold Answer content.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript ([P-6]). No hallucinated medications or supplements are added. The answer is faithful but incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for OTC medications/supplements taken both for chest pain and as part of regular routine, plus effectiveness. The answer addresses the chest-pain OTC attempts and their effectiveness, but fails to address the regular routine supplement (multivitamin) and medication status, so it only partially answers the question."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded for the chest-pain OTC trials and their ineffectiveness, but incomplete because it omits the patient’s regular multivitamin (and ‘no other meds’) and therefore only partially answers the full question."
