  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the symptoms the doctor attributed to a general infectious process (fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches) and the symptoms that prevented ruling out COVID-19 (shortness of breath, cough, and sore throat) based on turn D-36. This aligns perfectly with the clinical synthesis provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the specific symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer. It distinguishes between the constitutional symptoms of infection and the respiratory symptoms specific to the COVID-19 concern.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer correctly attributes the symptoms to the specific turns in the transcript (D-36, P-1, P-20, P-4). However, it references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source transcript or prompt context, constituting a minor hallucination of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question using the doctor's specific clinical assessment from the end of the transcript."
