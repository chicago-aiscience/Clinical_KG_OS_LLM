  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes that BOTH patient (P-1: 'in case I have covid') and doctor (D-2, D-39) identified COVID-19 as needing to be ruled out. Generated Answer correctly notes doctor identified common cold primarily but COVID-19 to rule out (D-39), but does not explicitly state or cite the patient's identification of COVID-19 concern, introducing a minor discrepancy. Test (swab), turnaround (48 hours), and instructions (isolation) match exactly with Gold and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Both identify COVID-19 to rule out (patient P-1/D-2, doctor D-39); (2) COVID swab today (D-39); (3) 48 hours (D-39); (4) stay isolated/not see anyone + further public health instructions (D-39). Generated covers: COVID to rule out (doctor only, misses patient explicit), swab (yes), 48 hours (yes), isolated at home (partial, misses 'not see anyone' and public health). Covers ~80-99% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated directly verifiable in transcript: common cold/viral (D-39), COVID rule out/swab/48 hours/isolation (D-39), symptoms (earlier exchanges). Citations accurate to [D-39]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the 4 question elements (condition, test, TAT, instructions) with bullet points, perfectly focused on query without tangents."
