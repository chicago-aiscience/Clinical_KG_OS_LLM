  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the persistent dry cough (4-5 days, non-improving) and some pertinent negatives (fever/chills, sore throat, chest pain, nausea/vomiting/headache) matching the Gold Answer and transcript, and correctly cites the doctor's statements for ordering tests [D-37, D-39]. Minor discrepancies include calling the cough 'chronic' (it's acute 4-5 days), 'beyond 5 days,' omitting some negatives like taste/smell and muscle aches in the list (though referenced later), no sick contacts/travel, family history, and novelty of cough; it infers COVID rationale from symptoms as 'hallmark' rather than exact protocol quote, but core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: dry cough details [P-2,5,6,7], clear runny nose [P-11,12] (mentioned but not detailed), several negatives (fever/chills [P-13], sore throat [P-9], chest pain [P-15], muscle pain somewhat [D-14,P-14], headaches [P-18]); X-ray for 'better look' [D-37]; COVID swab rationale partially (symptoms trigger). Missed: full negatives list (taste/smell [P-10], N/V/abd [P-16,17]), no sick contacts [P-19,22]/travel [P-20], family asthma hx [P-28], cough novelty [P-24], explicit 'standard protocol' phrasing [D-39], persistent despite no high-acuity markers context. Covers ~60-70% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like cough duration, dry/non-productive, negatives, and doctor quotes [D-37, D-39, various P] are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. Hallucinations include 'chronic respiratory issue' (not chronic), Knowledge Graph references (absent), specific differentials (bronchitis/pneumonia/foreign body/structural - plausible but unstated), 'hallmark of COVID/mild variants/refusal to report' (not in transcript; contradicts protocol reason), assumption of no physical exam findings (exam pending). Multiple added interpretive facts not grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how persistent cough and absent red flags led to X-ray (visualize lungs) and COVID swab (rule out virus despite mild picture), structured around question's present/absent findings; minor tangents like Knowledge Graph and unstated differentials but overall focused on diagnostic logic."
