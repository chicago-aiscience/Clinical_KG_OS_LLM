  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline: cough onset Wednesday evening (mild dry [P-1]), fatigue/tiredness on Thursday [P-1], cough worsening and new fever on Friday [P-1,P-2], decreased appetite on Friday [P-15]. Minor discrepancy: does not explicitly note cough 'little bit worse' on Thursday (per Gold from [P-1]) or additional Friday symptoms like runny nose [P-16], suspected loss of taste [P-17], significant fatigue [P-25]; includes minor speculation on breathing difficulty [P-8] not emphasized in Gold as a symptom. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covered: cough first Wed eve (mild dry), persisted/worsened Thu-Fri, fatigue Thu, fever first Fri, decreased appetite Fri. Missed/partial: explicit Thu cough 'little bit worse' [P-1], Fri runny nose [P-16], loss of taste detail [P-17], significant fatigue Fri [P-25], mother's stepwise summary [P-12], 3-day correction [P-4]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in cited transcript sections ([P-1] for timeline/tiredness/worsening/fever, [P-2] fever details, [P-15] appetite, [P-8] tiredness/breathing speculation). No hallucinations; breathing note is mother's verbatim speculation, accurately represented.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response day-by-day addressing cough onset/evolution, fever emergence Fri, fatigue Thu, appetite Fri per question; minor tangent on breathing speculation but stays focused on symptom progression without off-topic content."
