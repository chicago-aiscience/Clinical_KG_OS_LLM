{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma (Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction) and provides accurate transcript citations for the supporting evidence it includes. It aligns well with the Gold Answer's medical conclusion.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is less comprehensive than the Gold Answer. While it addresses four of the triggers mentioned in the prompt (activity, cold, rest, allergies), it fails to provide the transcript evidence for the 'multiple settings' finding (P-38). Additionally, it misses secondary supporting details present in the Gold Answer, such as the nocturnal episode (P-43, P-44) and the pertinent negatives (absence of fever, runny nose, etc.) which help rule out infections.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All cited passages (P-1, P-2, P-3, P-6, P-35, P-38) are used correctly and accurately reflect the conversation between the doctor and parent.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, focusing specifically on the diagnosis and the supporting evidence requested by the prompt without any extraneous information."
