  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the key requested characteristics: dry cough, diarrhea frequency (5–6/day), vomiting episodes (2), and headache severity (7/10). However, it contains a notable factual error: it states diarrhea began ~4 days ago and cites [P-1], whereas the transcript specifies diarrhea started ~2 days ago [P-28]. Other additions (e.g., vomiting started “a few days back”) are broadly consistent with [P-1] and [P-32].",
    "completeness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, it captures only a subset: dry cough, liquid stools with 5–6/day frequency, two vomiting episodes, persistent headache, 7/10 severity, and 4-day onset for headache/cough. It omits multiple gold key details: no sputum/blood, stable cough severity, respiratory negatives (no SOB/wheeze/chest pain); diarrhea onset of 2 days and no blood; nausea today; vomitus described as food contents and non-bloody; GI negatives (no bloating/constipation/appetite change); headache location (forehead/top, bilateral), no neck radiation/stiffness, unusual history; plus loss of smell and mild fatigue.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript and appropriately cited, but the claim that diarrhea began ~4 days ago is not supported by [P-1] and conflicts with [P-28]. Aside from this misattribution/misinterpretation, the remaining claims are largely verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms and provides the specific requested characteristics (nature of cough, diarrhea frequency, vomiting count, headache severity), with minimal extraneous content."
