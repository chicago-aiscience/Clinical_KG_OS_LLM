  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the 'Resolution' of the pain. It claims the pain does not resolve on its own and requires intervention, which directly contradicts the patient's statement in [P-9] that the pain 'goes away' when at school or talking to people. Furthermore, it incorrectly attributes the chest pain to current anxiety attacks by misinterpreting [P-20], where the patient was actually discussing heart fluttering/palpitations from the past, not the current chest pain.",
    "completeness": "While the answer covers quality, duration, and some situations of occurrence (walking/studying), it completely misses the key situational resolution (talking to people, hands-on tasks) highlighted in the Gold Answer. By incorrectly stating the pain doesn't resolve on its own, it fails to provide the relevant clinical observation about the pain's behavioral patterns.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misinterprets the transcript in two major ways. First, it cites [P-20] to link the chest pain to anxiety attacks, but [P-20] is a response to a question about heart fluttering. Second, it ignores the patient's explicit statement in [P-9] and [P-29] that the pain resolves when distracted or socializing, instead hallucinating that it doesn't resolve without intervention.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer follows the structure of the question and attempts to address all required components (quality, duration, occurrence, resolution)."
