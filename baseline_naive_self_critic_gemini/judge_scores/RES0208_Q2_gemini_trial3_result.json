  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the information it provides about Tums and the reflux condition. However, it fails to mention Avodart, which the patient explicitly states he takes for his prostate [P-26]. Because the facts it does provide are consistent with the Gold Answer, it scores a 4.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the reflux-related medication, the change made (stopping the previous medication), and the reasoning (identifying triggers/diet). However, it completely misses the second medication the patient is taking (Avodart) and the corresponding condition (enlarged prostate). This represents an omission of approximately one-third of the required medical information (4 out of 6 key points).",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript [P-25, P-27]. There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question asked, though it is under-inclusive."
