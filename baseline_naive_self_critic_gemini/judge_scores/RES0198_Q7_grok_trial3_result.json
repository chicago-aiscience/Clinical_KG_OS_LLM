  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the onset as approximately one week prior (matching Gold and [P-1,P-2]). However, it incorrectly states that both stuffy nose and runny nose started concurrently with 'no specific evidence' for which appeared first, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [P-3] where patient says 'It felt pretty stuffy at first.' It also wrongly claims no change in predominant symptom (ignores [P-3] 'now it's mostly running' and Gold's shift description). Finally, it misstates symptoms as intermittent based only on [P-1] 'on and off,' ignoring the clarification in [P-8] 'pretty constant for the past week' as noted in Gold. These are significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Onset ~1 week ago; 2) Initial symptom nasal congestion ('stuffy at first'); 3) Shift to predominant rhinorrhea ('now mostly running'); 4) Possible influence of decongestants; 5) Pattern: initially 'on and off' but overall 'pretty constant'; 6) Symptoms not improved. Covered: only onset (partial). Missed: initial symptom specificity, progression/shift, decongestants, full pattern details, lack of improvement. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Onset verifiable [P-1,P-2]. Claim of concurrent onset and 'no specific evidence' for first symptom hallucinates absence of evidence when [P-3] explicitly states 'stuffy at first.' No predominant change ignores direct [P-3] quote. Intermittent only cites [P-1] but ignores contradictory [P-8] clarification, introducing selective hallucination by omission. Multiple ungrounded/misinterpreted claims.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured directly around the question's elements (onset, progression over week, constant/intermittent), with no off-topic content or tangents, perfectly mirroring the query's focus despite factual issues."
