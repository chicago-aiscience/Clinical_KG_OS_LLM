  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor's plan was not communicated in the transcript. This is a significant factual error as the transcript explicitly contains the doctor's plan for a chest X-ray, a COVID-19 swab, and a consultation with a supervising physician in segments [D-37] through [D-40].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses all key points of the doctor's plan requested by the question (tests, consultation, and follow-up). Instead, it provides a summary of the patient's history which was not the primary focus of the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails faithfulness because it claims the transcript ends before a plan is discussed, which is a hallucination of the transcript's boundaries. The relevant information is present in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant as it spends most of its length summarizing the patient's history and review of systems after incorrectly asserting that the answer to the prompt is not available."
