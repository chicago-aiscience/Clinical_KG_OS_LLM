  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains key factual errors relative to the Gold Answer/transcript. Most importantly, it states the initial symptom was a dry cough and scratchy throat together, whereas Jessica explicitly says she first noticed a scratchy throat and then started coughing (P-4). It also asserts that the sensation of feeling hot occurred after the respiratory symptoms and represents a subsequent escalation; the transcript does not establish that ordering, and the Gold Answer explicitly notes the exact day of onset of feeling hot relative to throat/cough is not specified. Interpreting “feeling hot” as fever is reasonable, but presenting the timing/escalation as likely is inaccurate vs the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: 3–4 day duration; scratchy throat and dry cough; headache; malaise; feeling hot. Key points missed/incorrectly handled: (1) correct symptom order (scratchy throat first, then cough), (2) the nuance that the onset timing of feeling hot relative to throat/cough is NOT specified, (3) persistence of feeling hot “all the time” day and night with clothing detail, (4) fatigue/tiredness, and (5) the framing that progression is from local upper-airway symptoms to broader systemic symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “Knowledge Graph” (not in the source), the claim that feeling hot followed the initial symptoms, and the speculation that it indicates escalation/shift in severity. The transcript supports that she felt hot and that it was persistent day and night, but the Generated Answer omits that persistence and instead invents a relative timing.",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally focused on symptom sequence and the relationship of ‘feeling hot’ to cough/throat symptoms, but it adds minor irrelevant framing (Knowledge Graph, escalation speculation). Overall it still addresses the question."
