  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains no factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer or transcript; all stated facts about cough duration (3 months [P-2]), intermittent/recurring nature [P-2], 'gross' description [P-2, P-9], pain only when coughing [P-3], sputum as 'gunk' that is 'really gross' and 'greenish' [P-2, P-9], sleep disturbance [P-19, P-20], fatigue [P-19], and exercise limitation [P-47] are accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered from Gold: cough lasting 3 months, intermittent/recurring, gross, chest discomfort/pain only when coughing, sputum greenish/gross/gunk, sleep disturbance (partial), fatigue (implied), impaired exercise. Missed: initial dry nature and onset during pole dancing class [P-2, P-13], productive only past 3 days [P-12], no blood in sputum [P-10], no foul smell [P-11], cough wakes every night for last month [P-20, P-21], subjective fevers/feeling hot at night [P-4]; explicit denials missed: night sweats [P-5], unexplained weight loss/loose clothes [P-6-8], hemoptysis [P-10], nausea/vomiting [P-17], stiff neck [P-18], body pain/tenderness [P-19], sick contacts [P-14,15,32]. Covers approximately 25-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-2], [P-9], [P-3], [P-19], [P-47]); quotes like 'gross', 'gunk', 'greenish', 'kinda hurts when I cough', 'waking me up a little bit', 'a little tired', and 'missing like my exercise stuff' match patient statements precisely; no hallucinated facts or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by structuring content into 'Respiratory Symptoms and Cough Characteristics', 'Sputum', 'Associated Symptoms', and 'Explicit Denials', focusing solely on reported respiratory/associated symptoms, cough/sputum details, and denials without any off-topic content."
