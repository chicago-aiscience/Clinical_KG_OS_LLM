{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the facts presented in the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the stuffy nose as the first symptom, followed by the fever (3 days) and sore throat. It also correctly notes the husband's week-long symptom duration.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details from the gold answer. Specifically, it fails to mention that the muscle aches occurred concurrently with the fever (2-3 days ago), instead noting only that they were mentioned 'later in the consultation.' It also omits the explicit conclusion that the husband's illness began approximately four days before the patient's, which is a key part of the 'timeline comparison' requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is entirely faithful to the source transcript and contains no hallucinations. All citations ([P-1], [P-13], [P-19]) are accurate to the points being made.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the sequence of symptoms and the comparison with the husband's timeline."
