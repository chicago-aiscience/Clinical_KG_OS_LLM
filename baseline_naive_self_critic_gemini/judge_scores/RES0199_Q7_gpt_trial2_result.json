  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the first symptoms as headache and cough starting four days ago, and correctly places diarrhea at ~2 days ago and loss of smell at ~1 day ago. It also correctly characterizes the cough as dry and stable. However, it is slightly inaccurate/overly inferential in stating that nausea/vomiting occurred “following shortly thereafter” the diarrhea: the transcript specifies nausea today and vomiting yesterday (2 episodes), and also contains a vaguer statement (“a few days back”) without a clear sequence relative to diarrhea. Additionally, it does not explicitly state that the headache severity stayed about the same over the four days (it only says persistent and gives the 7/10 severity).",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) initial symptoms (headache + cough) began first at day 4; (2) diarrhea began ~2 days ago; (3) loss of smell began ~1 day ago; (4) cough remained stable. Key points missed/understated: (1) explicit statement that the headache did not worsen and “stayed around the same” over four days; (2) clearer GI timing details from the transcript—vomiting occurred yesterday (2x) and nausea persisted today, rather than a nonspecific “following shortly thereafter.”",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript and cited appropriately (onset of headache/cough, diarrhea timing, smell change, cough being dry). The only potentially ungrounded element is the implied sequence that nausea/vomiting followed after diarrhea; the transcript gives nausea/vomiting timing but not a definite order relative to diarrhea onset. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question’s requested timeline (what came first, when GI symptoms and anosmia began relative to initial symptoms, and how headache/cough evolved), with minimal extraneous information."
