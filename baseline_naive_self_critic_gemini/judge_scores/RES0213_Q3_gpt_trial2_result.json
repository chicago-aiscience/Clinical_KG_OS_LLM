  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer diagnosis is anxiety-related/stress-induced chest pain (panic/anxiety-spectrum/functional chest pain), supported by the situational pattern and anxiety history. The Generated Answer instead labels the diagnosis as “Angina Pectoris (stress-induced angina)” and only secondarily mentions psychogenic/anxiety-related pain. This is a major mismatch: the transcript pattern (occurs when alone/thinking, improves with distraction, no exertional worsening) argues against angina and toward anxiety. Some supporting observations it lists are consistent with the Gold Answer (solitary/studying context, hyperventilation when nervous, academic stress, anxiety history), but the primary diagnostic label is incorrect. It also adds a questionable inference that lack of response to OTC analgesics/Alka-Seltzer indicates non-musculoskeletal pain; this is not established in the Gold Answer and is not a reliable discriminator.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) symptoms during solitary activities/studying/walking; (2) anxiety/panic history; (3) heightened academic stress; (4) nervousness with faster breathing/difficulty taking deep breath; (5) father’s heart attack as stressor/patient considering stress. Key points missed: explicit improvement with distraction/social interaction/working with hands [P-9, P-29] (only partially implied), and the Gold Answer’s pertinent negatives supporting non-cardiac/non-pulmonary etiologies (no fever, no exertional worsening, occurs at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety, no asthma).",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not well-grounded in the transcript: calling this “angina pectoris”/“stress-induced angina” is not supported by the provided history and conflicts with the transcript’s pattern. The citation/phrasing that the doctor “acknowledges” anxiety history is overstated (the patient reports the history). The ‘medication resistance implies not musculoskeletal’ claim is an ungrounded inference. Most other cited observations (studying/walking context, nervous breathing) are present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on proposing a diagnosis and listing consultation observations to justify it. Aside from the added point about OTC medication response (minor tangent), the content is largely on-task, even though the main diagnostic conclusion is incorrect."
