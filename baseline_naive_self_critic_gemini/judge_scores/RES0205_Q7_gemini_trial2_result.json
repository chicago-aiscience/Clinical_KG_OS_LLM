  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a minor factual discrepancy regarding the duration of mucus production. It states the productive phase lasted for the first 2-3 days, whereas the transcript (P-6) and Gold Answer clearly state it lasted 4-5 days. Other core facts about the onset and resolution of secondary symptoms are correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer and the specific prompt requirements: it does not describe what the mucus looked like ('whitish clear'), does not mention that intensity and frequency remained stable over time, and omits the negative COVID-19 test result.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is generally grounded in the transcript, though the timing of the cough transition is slightly compressed compared to the source text. No major hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant to the question about the timeline, but it fails to address specific sub-questions in the prompt, such as the appearance of the mucus and the change in frequency/intensity of the cough."
