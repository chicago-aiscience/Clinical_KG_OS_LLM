  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the timeline (~4–5 days), the initial activity trigger (playing tag/exertion), the episodic/fluctuating nature with resolution on rest and recurrence with activity, the later development of a slight cough, and the single nocturnal wheezy episode with trouble falling asleep. It also correctly includes cold weather as a worsening factor (supported by the transcript). The main issue is the repeated reference to a “clinical knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript and therefore introduces unsupported assertions about symptom co-occurrence (though these do not directly contradict the clinical facts).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: onset 4–5 days prior; exertional trigger; fluctuating episodic pattern with improvement at rest and recurrence with activity; cough emerging after wheeze/SOB; single nocturnal wheezy episode with trouble falling asleep. Missing/de-emphasized vs Gold: earliest symptom detail of difficulty taking deep breaths; cough being non-productive/no phlegm; pertinent negatives (no fever, no cyanosis, fine otherwise between episodes). Given the question focus, the missing deep-breath detail is the main completeness gap.",
    "faithfulness": "Most clinical details are grounded in cited transcript lines. However, the answer repeatedly cites a “clinical knowledge graph” and claims it ‘supports’ coexistence of cough/wheeze and sleep disturbance—this is not in the transcript and constitutes hallucinated/unsupported content. The core patient-history statements remain faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on symptom development over time (trigger, fluctuation, cough emergence, nocturnal episode) as asked, with no major irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "Clinically accurate and on-topic with good coverage of the requested symptom timeline, but faithfulness is reduced by unsupported references to a “clinical knowledge graph” and it omits a few transcript-based details (notably difficulty taking deep breaths and nonproductive cough)."
