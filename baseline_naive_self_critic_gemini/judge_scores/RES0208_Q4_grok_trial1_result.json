  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain explicit instances of the doctor asking about or the patient denying chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence (e.g., D-10/P-10 for runny nose, D-15/P-15 for nausea, D-16/P-16 for chest pain, D-17/P-17 for palpitations). It fails to list any of the Gold Answer's specified symptoms accurately and provides generic explanations not aligned with the Gold's precise differentiations, resulting in factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer lists 8 specific denied symptoms with citations (runny nose/congestion, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling) and targeted differentiations (cardiac, GI, common cold, neurological). Generated Answer covers none of these key points, instead discussing unrelated negations (e.g., severity of breathing, cough frequency) and general DDx, achieving <20% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that key symptoms are absent from the transcript despite clear evidence (D-10 to D-22); mis-cites irrelevant sections (e.g., D-3/P-3 for breathing); introduces unmentioned 'knowledge graph'; and fabricates general clinical differentiations not verifiable in the transcript, with multiple inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question by discussing denied symptoms and their role in differentiating respiratory distress causes but deviates significantly by denying the existence of the queried symptoms and providing off-topic or generic content instead of transcript-specific analysis."
