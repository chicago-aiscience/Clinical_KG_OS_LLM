  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer without errors or contradictions: exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), tick attachment >72 hours, geographic risk (Strathroy concerning per map), and prior history (10-year-old tick bite with bullseye rash requiring antibiotics). It correctly notes the despite factors (not deer tick-like, no current rash) and doctor's prioritization of cumulative risk, aligning fully with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers all major key points from Gold: exposure [P-1], duration [D-6], geography [D-13], prior history [P-3], and context of despite factors. Misses minor details like explicit uncertainty of attachment timing, 'along the creek,' patient's comment on all ticks as carriers [P-5], lab testing [D-6], and 'safer than not' phrasing [D-18], estimating 85-90% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: exposure [P-1], duration [D-6], geography [D-13], prior history [P-3], not deer tick [P-5/D-5], no rash [P-6]. 'Known susceptibility' is a reasonable interpretation grounded in prior reaction [P-3]; no hallucinations or unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response around the exact four specified factors (exposure, duration, geography, prior history) and explicitly referencing the 'despite' conditions (not deer tick, no rash), with no off-topic content."
