  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key endorsed respiratory symptoms (worsening cough over the last week beyond chronic baseline [P-1,P-5], shortness of breath over last few days with exertion [P-1,P-5,P-8], sputum change from baseline clear-to-white to more yellow [P-6, minor phrasing as 'clear to yellow/white' vs Gold's 'clear-to-white'], chest discomfort during coughing [P-13]). However, it misses chills over last couple days without measured fever [P-29,P-30], a systemic symptom in Gold. Critically, it incorrectly claims no explicit denials in transcript for commonly screened symptoms like orthopnea [P-9], PND [P-10], hemoptysis [P-7], palpitations [P-14], fever (indirect [P-29,P-30]), and ignores the full list of other negatives in Gold (e.g., calf pain [P-15], dizziness [P-16], etc.). This introduces significant factual contradictions vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covered: worsening cough timing/triggers, increased SOB severity/timing, sputum baseline vs current change, chest discomfort. Missed: chills (systemic), all pertinent negatives (orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations, fever context, calf pain, dizziness/fainting, numbness/tingling, confusion/memory loss, headaches, bowel/appetite/urine changes, nasal/sore throat, vision/hearing/smell/taste changes, weight loss, rashes, fatigue). Covers ~4 key endorsed points out of ~6 in Gold (80% of endorsed but 0% of ~20 negatives), overall ~20-40% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Endorsed symptom claims fully verifiable with accurate citations [P-1,P-5,P-6,P-8,P-13]. Sputum paraphrase grounded but slightly rephrased ('darker yellow' infers 'more yellow'). However, claim that 'transcript segments do not contain specific explicit denials' for listed symptoms is false/hallucinated as denials are explicitly present (e.g., [P-7,P-9,P-10,P-14]); multiple such unverifiable/incorrect assertions about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around endorsed respiratory symptoms, sputum change, and denied symptoms per question; no off-topic content or tangents, though errs in assessing denials and misses some systemic (chills). Perfectly focused on question elements."
