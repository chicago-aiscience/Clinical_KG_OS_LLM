  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the plan was not communicated and that the transcript does not contain output regarding the treatment plan. In reality, the transcript explicitly details a plan involving a chest X-ray [D-37], a COVID swab [D-39], consultation with a supervising physician [D-37], and a return to discuss next steps [D-40].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points requested in the prompt (diagnostic tests, physician consultation, and follow-up steps), instead providing a clinical summary of symptoms which was not the focus of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a limitation of the transcript, claiming it ends before the plan is discussed, despite the transcript clearly providing the plan in the final turns (D-37 to D-40).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the prompt because it denies the existence of the information requested, making the entire response irrelevant to the specific task."
