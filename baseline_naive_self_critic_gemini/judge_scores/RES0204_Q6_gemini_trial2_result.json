  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that the doctor's plan was not communicated and that the transcript does not contain output regarding next steps. However, the transcript (D-37, D-39, D-40) clearly outlines a plan for a chest X-ray, a COVID swab, consultation with a supervising physician, and a follow-up discussion.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers 0% of the key points in the Gold Answer. It misses the specific diagnostic tests (X-ray, COVID swab), the consultation plan, and the follow-up steps entirely.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness by claiming the information is absent when it is clearly present in the text. This is a form of negative hallucination (denying the existence of provided facts).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer does not address the question. Instead of describing the plan, it provides an unsolicited summary of symptoms and then incorrectly claims the requested information does not exist."
