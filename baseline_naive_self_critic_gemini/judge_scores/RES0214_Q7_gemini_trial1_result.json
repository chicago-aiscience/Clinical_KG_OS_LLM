  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer regarding the sequence of the stuffy nose, fever, and sore throat. It also correctly cites the husband's symptom duration (one week) versus the patient's fever (three days).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but is less detailed than the gold answer. It misses the specific duration of the muscle aches (2-3 days) and their temporal overlap with the fever, instead noting they were mentioned 'later in the consultation.' It also does not explicitly calculate the onset gap between the husband and patient (approximately four days) as the gold answer does.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the generated answer are grounded in the provided transcript. The citations [P-1], [P-13], and [P-19] are used correctly to support the claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the progression of symptoms, the initial symptom, and the comparison with the husband's timeline."
