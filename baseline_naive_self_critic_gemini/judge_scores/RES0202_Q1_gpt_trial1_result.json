  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes the mother reported a dry cough, fever over 100°F, and fatigue, and that shortness of breath was uncertain. However, it contains major factual errors regarding the doctor-asked/denied symptoms: the transcript *does* include explicit denials for chest pain/heart racing (P-13), sore throat (P-14), chills/night sweats (P-19), and GI symptoms including diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool (P-22) and nausea/vomiting (P-23). The answer also introduces an unrelated “knowledge graph” asthma linkage not present in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key reported symptoms from the Gold Answer that are missing include: mild runny nose (P-16), decreased appetite (P-15), possible loss of taste (P-17), and vision/hearing being fine (P-18). Key explicit negatives that are missing include: no sputum or blood (P-6), no wheezing (P-7), no rash/skin-hair-nail changes (P-20), no urinary changes (P-24), no dizziness/fainting (P-25), and no confusion/memory loss (P-26). It also fails to note the Gold nuance that swallowing difficulty was *uncertain* rather than denied (P-15). Overall, it covers well under ~50% of the Gold Answer’s required items.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not faithful to the transcript: it claims there are no explicit denials for several symptoms where clear denials exist (P-13, P-14, P-19, P-22, P-23). It also adds an extraneous “knowledge graph” asthma association that is not part of the transcript. While some elements are grounded (cough/fever/fatigue), the answer includes several ungrounded or contradicted claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (respiratory/systemic symptoms reported and symptoms asked/denied), but it includes a minor tangent about an asthma knowledge-graph link and, more importantly, does not accurately provide the requested denied symptoms list."

  "summary": "Partially captures the main reported symptoms but misses many Gold Answer elements and incorrectly claims key doctor-asked symptoms were not explicitly denied, with additional ungrounded content reducing faithfulness."
