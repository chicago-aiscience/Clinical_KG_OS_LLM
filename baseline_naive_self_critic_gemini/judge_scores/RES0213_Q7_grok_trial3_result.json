  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the exact age the patient began smoking is not specified in the transcript, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [P-18: 'when I was probably 18'], misses key timeline details like the 8-year gap without anxiety [P-22], escalation to 10 cigarettes/day for past 2 years [P-18], cutting down a few months ago [P-14,P-18], and precise stress timing in 'last couple of weeks' due to thesis [P-15,P-16]; it covers chest pain onset and father's heart attack but adds causal links not emphasized in Gold (e.g., smoking+stress directly causing pain) and inaccurately attributes past anxiety to shortness of breath.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: teenage anxiety attacks [P-21], recent academic stress [P-13,P-15], chest pain ~1.5 weeks ago [P-2], possible stress cause [P-8], father's heart attack [P-8]; missed or incomplete: smoking start at ~18 [P-18], 8-year anxiety-free period [P-22], 2-year smoking peak at 10 cigs/day [P-18], cut to 5 cigs few months ago [P-14,P-18], intensified stress last couple weeks/thesis crunch [P-15,P-16], anxiety possibly returning [P-22], pain noticeable when alone [P-9,P-29]; covers ~40% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like smoking start age 'not specified' is false [P-18]; past anxiety caused shortness of breath is hallucinated (transcript only says 'anxiety attacks' [P-21,P-22], current SOB linked to nervousness [P-19]); adds '[KG: stress and smoking both contribute to chest pain]' not in transcript; some citations accurate [P-2,P-6,P-8,P-13,P-19] but interpretations add unverifiable clinical links; multiple hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Structures a timeline (smoking, teen anxiety, academic stress, chest pain) and discusses phase relationships as asked, directly addressing the question despite inaccuracies; minor tangents via clinical knowledge."
