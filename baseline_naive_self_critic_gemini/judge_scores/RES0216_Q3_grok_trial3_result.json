  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures core elements like asthma history, chest tightness worsened by exertion, absence of pain lowering cardiac concern, and trial of rescue inhaler, aligning with Gold. However, it inaccurately states Salbutamol as currently prescribed rescue (patient hasn't refilled in years, uses daily maintenance inconsistently), misses key medication non-compliance (skipping evening dose P-19, no rescue refill P-17/18) emphasized in Gold/D-34, omits patient's acknowledgment it could be related (P-16), no environmental triggers (P-33), and adds non-key elements like hoarseness/phlegm (P-11) and allergies (P-32) not central to doctor's reasoning. Some factual errors but main point consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) asthma history [covered], (2) med non-compliance (skipping evening, no rescue) [missed], (3) symptoms tightness/exertion/diff breath [covered], (4) patient says could be related [missed], (5) no env triggers [missed], (6) no cardiac indicators [covered], (7) rescue trial [covered]. Covers ~57% (4/7 key points), adds extras like hoarseness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: symptoms [P-1,7,9,10], cardiac exclusion [D-36], asthma history [P-16/25/29], meds [P-25/26], reasoning/trial [D-35/36]. Hoarseness [P-11] present but not doctor-highlighted for diagnosis; 'aligns with asthma' plausible but interpretive; Salbutamol as rescue slightly stretched (transcript distinguishes daily/as-needed). Mostly grounded, minor unverifiable interpretations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer around symptoms, history, clinical features, and doctor's linking to asthma top differential, precisely matching question with no off-topic content."
