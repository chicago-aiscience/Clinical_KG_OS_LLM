  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies several symptoms consistent with the Gold Answer: loss of taste, subjective fever/feeling hot, weakness, decreased appetite, cough starting/dry, sore throat starting, headaches (stress-type), and muscle aches. However, it has minor issues: it introduces “heat intolerance” (not stated; the patient only felt hot/warm), and it includes “difficulty breathing/laborious breathing,” which overlaps with the chief complaint of shortness of breath (the question asks for symptoms beyond SOB/fatigue). It also supports sore throat and muscle aches primarily via the clinician summary [D-36] rather than the patient’s direct statements, though those symptoms are still present elsewhere in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: loss of taste; developing cough; sore throat; subjective fever; decreased appetite; weakness; headaches; muscle aches.\nKey points missed or insufficiently captured: diminished sense of smell; explicit denial of runny nose/nasal congestion; the characterization that the cough was minimal/“on its way” and dry; the characterization of myalgias as generalized/overall achy and not localized; and the nuance that headaches were not more than usual (likely baseline stress headaches). Overall, this is roughly 70–80% coverage of the Gold Answer’s content.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (taste change [P-4], cough starting [P-7/P-8], sore throat starting [P-9], feverish feeling [P-4], weakness [P-2], reduced intake/appetite [P-2/P-4], headaches [P-11/P-12], muscle aches [P-20/P-21]). Minor faithfulness concerns: “heat intolerance” is not stated, and citing clinician summary [D-36] rather than the patient utterances is less direct but not contradictory.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely focused on the requested additional symptoms (sensory, URI, musculoskeletal, constitutional). Minor reduction in relevance comes from re-including breathing difficulty (part of the chief complaint) and not explicitly noting the negative URI symptom (no congestion/runny nose), which the question asks to include."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is mostly accurate and transcript-grounded but misses several specific symptoms/qualifiers from the Gold Answer (notably loss of smell and denial of congestion) and adds minor imprecision (e.g., “heat intolerance”) while redundantly restating dyspnea details."
