  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment as an infection consistent with COVID-19 [D-44, D-45], alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative [D-44], COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround [D-44], false negative possibility [D-44], 14-day isolation [D-44], and warning signs matching exactly [D-44]. Minor discrepancies include phrasing asthma as 'ruled out as primary concern' (Gold says 'would add to list if no fever, but infection likely now'), and omitting isolation specifically from sister; also minor overemphasis on shortness of breath which was hypothetical [D-45]. Core facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key Gold points: assessment (viral/COVID/infection), swab & TAT, false neg, alt viral dx, warning signs (high temp, seizures, weakness/dizzy/fainting), asthma conditional note [D-45]. Misses 'including from younger sister if possible' in isolation [D-44] and explicit 'no medications, watchful waiting'. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [D-44, D-45]: infection, COVID alignment, swab details, isolation, false neg, alt viral, warnings, asthma conditional. Minor unverifiable: presents 'shortness of breath' as initial presentation (parent unsure [P-8], doctor hypothetical [D-45]); slight interpretive stretch on 'rule out asthma' but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured and focused on question elements: assessment/plan, test/TAT, isolation, alt dx/false neg, specific warning signs with examples; no irrelevant content."
