  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies Reactine (an OTC antihistamine) as taken occasionally for seasonal allergies, matching the Gold Answer's description from P-35 and P-36, and correctly states no prescribed medications (P-36, P-46, P-47). It does not contradict the absence of treatments for current respiratory episodes or past infections requiring no antibiotics. Minor discrepancy in phrasing Reactine as something 'the patient takes' (implying regularity) versus Gold's 'occasional,' and it separates 'Reactine' and generic 'OTC stuff' redundantly, but core facts are consistent with Gold. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) No medications/treatments for current wheezing/SOB episodes, resolves on own (P-33, P-34); (2) Occasional OTC antihistamines like Reactine for seasonal allergies (P-35, P-36); (3) No prescribed medications (P-36, P-46, P-47); (4) Past viral infections did not require antibiotics (P-16). Generated covers (2) and (3) fully, partially covers OTC usage, but misses (1) entirely (no mention of no treatment for respiratory episodes) and (4) completely. Covers ~50-60% of key points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine/OTC for allergies directly from P-36; no prescribed meds from P-36. However, 'Knowledge Graph explicitly links' is not in transcript (hallucination, unverifiable); minor overgeneralization of usage frequency. Most content grounded, but one clear hallucinated element. Score: 3.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly summarizes medications taken (Reactine/OTC for allergies), confirms no prescribed meds, and structures response around management, perfectly addressing the question about current/other conditions and prescribed meds with no off-topic content. Score: 5"
