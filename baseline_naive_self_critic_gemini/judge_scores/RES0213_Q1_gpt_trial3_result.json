  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies key pain qualities (initially “uncomfortable/odd,” later “sharp, strong,” pleuritic with deep breath) and episode duration (~20 minutes) and that symptoms have been present ~1.5 weeks. It also correctly notes common contexts of occurrence (studying/sitting; walking to school). However, it contains important inaccuracies: it states the pain “does not resolve on its own without intervention,” whereas the patient says it tends to go away / is not noticed when at school talking to people or otherwise preoccupied [P-9, P-29]. It also incorrectly links the pain to “an anxiety attack” using [P-20], which discusses palpitations/heart flutter during anxiety, not chest pain occurrence. There are also citation/mapping errors (deep breath trigger is [P-3], not [P-2]).",
    "completeness": "Covers: quality (uncomfortable/odd; sharp/strong; with deep breath), overall timeframe (~1.5 weeks), episode duration (~20 min), and some occurrence situations (studying; walking to school). Misses or mishandles key Gold points central to the question: intermittent nature “here and there” across the day; the pattern that it tends to occur when alone and resolve/be unnoticed when social/preoccupied/doing tasks at school; confirmation it can occur at rest; and lack of worsening with exercise (walking ‘stays the same’). Overall, it captures some but not most of the “occur vs resolve” characterization.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not supported by the transcript or contradict it: (1) claiming the pain does not resolve without intervention contradicts the patient’s report that it goes away/they don’t notice it when engaged at school/talking to people [P-9, P-29]; (2) claiming correlation with anxiety attacks is not stated for chest pain (anxiety is mentioned in relation to palpitations and feeling nervous) [P-19, P-20]. Additionally, at least one citation is inaccurate (deep-breath association cited to [P-2] instead of [P-3]). These issues reflect multiple hallucinated/unfaithful elements.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on the requested characteristics (quality, duration, contexts of occurrence), but includes some less-relevant content (OTC medication trials) and an incorrect anxiety-attack linkage. Still, it largely addresses the question."

  "summary": "The generated answer captures basic quality and duration and some triggers, but it misses the key “occurs when alone vs resolves when social/preoccupied” pattern and introduces unsupported/contradictory claims (notably about resolution and anxiety), reducing faithfulness and overall accuracy."
