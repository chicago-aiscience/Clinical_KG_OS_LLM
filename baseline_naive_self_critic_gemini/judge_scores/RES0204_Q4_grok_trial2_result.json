  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition ruled out, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-28]. It accurately quotes the mother's specific clinical findings: no shortness of breath or wheezing even with physical activity, directly from [P-28]. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer; minor omissions like explicit mention of grandparents or 'worked up' do not introduce inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: condition (asthma), citation [P-28], mother's specific pertinent negatives (no SOB, no wheezing even with physical activity). Missed: explicit grandparents family history detail, 'been worked up for that,' doctor acknowledgments [D-28/D-30], patient's healthy history [P-24], and conclusion 'he doesn't have that.' Covers core ~80-90% of key points focused on condition and symptoms cited by mother.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [P-28]: quotes match transcript exactly ('he doesn't get short of breath... with even with physical activity', 'or wheezing', 'anything like that'). Citation accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by naming asthma, linking to family history context implicitly via transcript, and listing exact symptoms NOT exhibited even during physical activity as cited by mother. Concise, no off-topic content."
