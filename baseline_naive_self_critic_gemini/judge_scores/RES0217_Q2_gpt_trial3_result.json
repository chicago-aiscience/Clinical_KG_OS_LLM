  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient’s current therapy as an unspecified statin for cholesterol management (consistent with [P-14–P-15]) and correctly reports the clinician’s plan to use prophylactic antibiotics due to likely prolonged attachment and Lyme-risk area (consistent with [D-6], [D-13]). It also correctly includes proposed diagnostic steps (tick identification and possible bloodwork/serology) from [D-6] and [D-18]. Minor issue: it adds an unverifiable meta-claim (“knowledge graph confirms…”) and a general statement (“statins treat high cholesterol”) not stated in the transcript, though these don’t materially change the clinical content.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) current statin use; (2) prophylactic antibiotics recommended; (3) tick sent for identification; (4) possible bloodwork/serology.\nKey points missed from the Gold Answer: (1) patient could not recall the statin name; (2) denial of allergies/no drug allergies; (3) past tick bite ~10 years ago treated with antibiotics; (4) environmental prevention suggestion (consider insecticide in garden). Overall coverage is partial relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly grounded in the transcript with appropriate references (statin use, prophylactic antibiotics, lab identification, bloodwork). However, the mention of a “knowledge graph” confirmation and the explanatory assertion that statins treat high cholesterol are not stated in the transcript (minor ungrounded additions). No major hallucinated medications/doses/durations were introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on medications and treatments discussed in the consultation, especially the statin and proposed prophylactic antibiotics, and includes related evaluation steps (tick testing, blood work). The brief “knowledge graph” mention is a minor tangent but does not substantially detract from answering the question."

  "summary": "Accurate and relevant summary of statin use and proposed prophylactic antibiotics, but it omits several treatments/details from the gold answer (allergies, prior antibiotic course, insecticide advice, inability to name statin) and includes a minor ungrounded “knowledge graph” statement."
