  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that Jessica has Claritin for seasonal allergies and that she is on birth control, and correctly notes she previously received allergy shots and not every year. However, it contains a factual error by stating that no dosing details were mentioned—whereas the transcript includes dosing/timing details for both the oral contraceptive (“the one that goes for three months”) and the allergy shots (“once a week for a little while, like in the winter before”). It also omits the specific contraceptive name (“Deyo”), which is part of the gold answer’s required specificity.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Claritin for seasonal allergies, carried ‘just in case’ and not currently taking; (2) birth control use (non-specific); (3) past allergy shots and not every year.\nKey points missed: (1) contraceptive name “Deyo”; (2) contraceptive schedule detail “goes for three months”; (3) allergy shots schedule/timing “once a week…in the winter before”; (4) she does not carry an EpiPen; (5) denial of medication allergies; (6) context that allergies are seasonal and not associated with facial swelling/breathing difficulty. Overall, it captures less than half of the requested/Gold details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript (Claritin, birth control, allergy shots not every year). The main issue is the claim that no dosing details were mentioned, which is contradicted by explicit dosing/timing statements in the transcript. No clear hallucinated medications or treatments are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications Jessica is taking/carrying and allergist treatments, with no notable tangents."
