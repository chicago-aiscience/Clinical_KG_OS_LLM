  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemia) and the primary reasons the doctor cited for deprioritizing it (lack of shortness of breath and absence of chest pain). It accurately reflects the doctor's statements in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the main points (ischemia, lack of breath, absence of pain). However, it misses the additional 'pertinent negatives' mentioned in the Gold Answer and the transcript, specifically the absence of anxiety, sweating, and feelings of impending doom which were also screened as evidence for deprioritizing an acute cardiac event.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript, particularly D-36 and P-1. No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific question asked, including the nature of complaints and the absence of symptoms."
