  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as cardiac ischemia/“cardiac ischemic picture,” which matches the Gold Answer and transcript [D-36]. It accurately reports the clinician’s stated rationale: (1) the patient did not “really get out of breath with exercise” [D-36], and (2) there was no chest pain/“haven’t had any pain associated with it” [D-36], consistent with the patient’s own report of “not really pain” [P-1] and explicit denial of pain [P-5]. No statements directly contradict the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) cardiac ischemic picture placed lower; (2) emphasis that symptoms were tightness rather than pain (partially covered via “absence of chest pain” and referencing “not really pain”);\nKey elements missed: (a) the specific characterization that the complaint was primarily “tightness” (including the pleuritic/inspiratory tightness) as an explicit nature-of-complaint detail [P-5]; (b) the pertinent negatives of anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom that were screened and denied [P-6] and cited in the Gold as supportive of deprioritizing cardiac causes. Because multiple symptom-absence findings requested by the question are omitted, coverage is incomplete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript: cardiac ischemia lower on differential [D-36], lack of exertional dyspnea per clinician [D-36], and absence of pain per clinician and patient [D-36, P-1, P-5]. No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on what was placed lower on the differential and the symptom findings used to justify that choice. It does not add irrelevant content."

  "summary": "Accurately identifies cardiac ischemia as lower on the differential and cites two correct supporting symptom features, but omits several key symptom-absence findings (e.g., sweating/anxiety/impending doom) and other requested chest-complaint specifics, making it incomplete."
