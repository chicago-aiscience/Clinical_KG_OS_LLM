  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition ruled out, accurately quotes the mother's statements from [P-28] on absence of shortness of breath and wheezing even during physical activity, and includes 'anything like that' directly from the transcript; all facts align fully with Gold Answer and no contradictions or errors present.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: condition (asthma), specific symptoms not exhibited even during physical activity (shortness of breath, wheezing), direct citation [P-28]; missed from Gold: explicit mention of grandparents/family history details, prior 'worked up' evaluation, doctor's prompts [D-28/D-30], patient's overall health [P-24], and conclusion 'doesn't have that'; covers core ~85% of key elements focused on by question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [P-28] with accurate quotes/paraphrases (e.g., 'he doesn't get short of breath... wheezing... even with physical activity', 'anything like that'); no unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses the question by naming the condition (asthma) and listing the exact mother-cited pertinent negatives (symptoms absent even during activity), with no off-topic content."
