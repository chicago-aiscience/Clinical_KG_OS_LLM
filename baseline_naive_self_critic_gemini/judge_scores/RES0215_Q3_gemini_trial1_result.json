  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma (Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction) and accurately attributes findings from the transcript to support this conclusion, matching the Gold Answer's medical logic.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most of the key points mentioned in the prompt (activity, cold, rest, allergies). However, compared to the Gold Answer, it misses: 1) Transcript evidence for symptoms occurring across multiple settings [P-38], 2) The significance of the nocturnal episode [P-43, P-44], and 3) Pertinent negatives like the absence of fever and phlegm which help rule out infections.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims and citations in the Generated Answer (P-1, P-2, P-3, P-6, P-35, P-38) are directly supported by the transcript and accurately reflect the conversation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly answering the question by identifying the diagnosis and providing supporting evidence from the text."
