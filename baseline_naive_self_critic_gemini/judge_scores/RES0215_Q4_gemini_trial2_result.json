  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the source material. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain questions about fever, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, rashes, and phlegm, when in fact these are present in lines D-7, D-8, D-10, D-11, D-13, and D-31. Because it incorrectly claims the information is missing, it fails to identify the patient's negative responses ('No') to these specific questions as requested.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to map fever to pneumonia/bronchitis, runny nose to URTI, sick contacts to contagious etiologies, travel to exposure, rashes to systemic/allergic conditions, and phlegm to productive vs. reactive cough. It provides an alternative analysis based on asthma triggers, but this does not address the specific prompts about the screening questions.",
    "faithfulness": "The response exhibits a significant hallucination/error by claiming that segments of the provided transcript are missing. All the specific screening questions and their corresponding responses are present in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only marginally relevant. While it correctly identifies the ultimate diagnosis (Asthma) and some supporting evidence (triggers, allergies), it completely fails to address the specific mechanism of the question, which was to explain the purpose of the specific screening questions listed in the prompt (fever, travel, etc.)."
