  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the main respiratory symptoms (wheezy, short of breath/difficulty deep breaths, cough, out of breath with activity) with correct citations matching the Gold Answer's core facts from [P-1], [P-2], [P-3]. Minor discrepancies include: referring to 'patient' instead of 'mother'; attributing earliest symptom solely to 'wheezy' based on [P-1] duration rather than both 'wheezy' and 'difficulty taking deep breaths' as explicitly first noticed in [P-2]; not noting cough as recent ('now' in [P-1]) or non-productive [P-31]; omitting 'hard time catching breath, no cyanosis' [P-32]. Core facts remain correct without major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: wheezy [P-1,P-2], short of breath/little SOB [P-1,P-2], slight cough [P-1], out of breath with activity [P-3]; partial earliest (wheezy but misses explicit pairing with difficulty deep breaths [P-2]). Missed: cough recent implication and non-productive [P-31], hard time catching breath/no cyanosis [P-32], looks fine otherwise [P-9]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations ([P-1],[P-2],[P-3]); no hallucinations or fabricated details; minor phrasing like 'patient' vs 'mother' but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists specific symptoms at presentation with bullets and addresses earliest symptoms section, perfectly matching question without tangents."
