  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the consultation ends at [P-47] without a doctor response, ignoring [D-48]; it denies the existence of the summary assessment, plan, and next steps explicitly stated by the doctor in [D-47] (cough summary, no constitutional symptoms, review with doctors) and [D-48] ('We'll see what we can do'), directly contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate extraction of these facts; significant factual errors throughout.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) summary assessment of cough duration, recent worsening, greenish sputum no blood, no constitutional symptoms [D-47]; (2) lowered concern for serious illness; (3) plan to review story with supervising doctors [D-47]; (4) patient addendum and doctor response [P-47/D-48]; (5) no tests/treatments ordered, next steps by supervising physician. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, claiming none exist.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends at [P-47] without conclusion, but [D-47] and [D-48] contain the exact summary, plan, and next steps; all claims of missing content are unverifiable and contradicted by the provided transcript; largely fabricated interpretation.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly attempts to address the question by claiming the required elements (plan, assessment, next steps info) are unavailable due to incomplete transcript, staying focused without off-topic content."
