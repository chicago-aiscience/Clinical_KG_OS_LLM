  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s included factual statements match the transcript and are consistent with the Gold Answer: 3-month intermittent cough, chest discomfort only with coughing, greenish/gross sputum, sleep disruption, fatigue, and exercise limitation are all supported by cited lines. It does not introduce clear clinical inaccuracies or contradictions relative to the Gold Answer. The only concern is the phrase “knowledge graph,” which is not in the transcript but is meta and does not alter clinical facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: (1) cough duration ~3 months and intermittent/recurrent nature, (2) productive cough with greenish sputum/gunk, (3) chest discomfort with coughing, (4) sleep disturbance and fatigue, (5) exercise limitation.\nKey points missed: (1) that the cough was initially dry, (2) that sputum production started ~3 days ago, (3) explicit denial of blood/hemoptysis, (4) no foul smell noticed, (5) subjective fever/feeling hot at night, (6) cough waking her up nightly for ~last month (frequency), and most importantly (7) multiple explicit denials asked by the doctor: night sweats, weight loss/loose clothes, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, body pain/tenderness (partially addressed), and lack of sick contacts (class/recent/home). Overall coverage is well under the majority of the Gold Answer’s required denials and symptom characterization.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all included clinical claims are directly supported by the transcript citations provided. However, the mention of a “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript, and the answer implicitly frames denials narrowly (mostly pain) while omitting other denials; omission is not hallucination, but it reduces perceived grounding/completeness. No major fabricated symptoms are added.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely on-topic (respiratory symptoms, cough/sputum characteristics, and denials), but it fails to answer a major part of the question: the full set of symptoms she explicitly denied when asked (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis, N/V, stiff neck, sick contacts, etc.). Minimal extraneous content aside from “knowledge graph.”"
