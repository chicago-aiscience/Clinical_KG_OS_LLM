  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the start of the cough on Wednesday evening, the fatigue on Thursday, and the emergence of the fever and decreased appetite on Friday.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific symptoms and details mentioned in the Gold Answer: the mild runny nose (P-16), the suspected loss of taste (P-17), the mother's summary of the progression (P-12), and the correction of the illness duration from five days to three days (P-4). It also fails to explicitly mention that the cough 'seemed to get a little bit worse' on Thursday specifically, noting it only for Friday.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is strictly grounded in the transcript. Every claim is supported by a citation that matches the dialogue, including the parent's speculation regarding breathing difficulties from P-8.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, following the requested day-by-day structure and focusing on the evolution of symptoms as prompted."
