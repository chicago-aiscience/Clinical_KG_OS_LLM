{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the respiratory condition. It accurately lists 'shortness of breath' and 'wheezing' as the symptoms the patient does not exhibit, and correctly places these findings in the context of physical activity as mentioned in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing) and the context (physical activity). However, it misses a specific point mentioned in the Gold Answer and the transcript: the mother's statement that the patient had been 'worked up for that' (previous negative clinical evaluation), which served as part of the basis for ruling it out. It also omits the patient's own observation about the novelty of the dry cough, though the prompt specifically asked for findings cited by the mother.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is strictly grounded in segment [P-28] of the transcript. There are no hallucinations; the quotes provided match the source text exactly.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without including extraneous information."
