  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the timeline of the cough (4-5 days) and the runny nose (past couple of days). However, it contains a factual error regarding citation [P-5], claiming it confirms the duration when [P-5] actually confirms the dry nature of the cough. Additionally, its description of the comparison to prior experiences focuses on the absence of asthma symptoms rather than the patient's direct statement in [P-24] about never having a dry cough like this and prior runny noses not lasting as long.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses a significant portion of the Gold Answer regarding the patient's comparison to prior experiences. Specifically, it omits that the patient had 'never had like a dry cough like this' and that past runny noses 'never lasted this long.' It also fails to explicitly mention that the cough was non-productive (no 'gunk'), although it notes the runny nose was clear.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript. However, the use of the word 'recurrence' regarding asthma symptoms is slightly misleading as the patient stated he was worked up for it and does not have it. There is also a citation error where [P-5] is attributed to duration instead of cough type.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure, addressing the sequence, timing, and severity of symptoms as prompted."
