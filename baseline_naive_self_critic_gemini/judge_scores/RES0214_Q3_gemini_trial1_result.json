    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the Gold Answer, specifically the mention of 'muscle aches' and the epidemiological context of the patient's husband also being sick, which the Gold Answer identifies as part of the doctor's reasoning for suspecting COVID-19.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is perfectly grounded in the transcript. All citations [P-1], [D-53], [P-53], and [D-54] are accurate and reflect the dialogue correctly.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question regarding symptoms for infectious etiology and the specific piece of vaccination history."
