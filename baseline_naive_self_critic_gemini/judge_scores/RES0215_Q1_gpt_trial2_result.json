  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key respiratory symptoms the mother reported at presentation: wheeze, shortness of breath, slight cough, and becoming out of breath with activity (all supported by P-1 and P-3). However, it is not fully accurate about the *earliest* symptoms: the transcript explicitly states the first noticed symptoms were **wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths** (P-2), whereas the Generated Answer names only wheezing as earliest. This is a minor but clinically relevant discrepancy (partial).",
    "completeness": "For symptoms at presentation, the Generated Answer covers the main items from the Gold Answer: wheeze, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, cough, and exertional dyspnea. It does not include additional episode descriptors in the Gold Answer (e.g., “hard time catching her breath,” denial of turning blue, non-productive cough), but these are not strictly required to answer the question as asked. The main completeness gap relative to the question is failing to include **difficulty taking deep breaths** as an earliest symptom alongside wheeze.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references (P-1, P-2, P-3). No clear hallucinated symptoms or unsupported claims are introduced. The only issue is interpretive/omissive (earliest symptom list), not fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on respiratory symptoms reported and which were earliest, directly addressing the question without irrelevant tangents."
