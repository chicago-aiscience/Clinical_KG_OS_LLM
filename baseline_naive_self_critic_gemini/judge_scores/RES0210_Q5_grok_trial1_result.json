  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately details all three risk factors with citations and their relations to symptoms (smoking impairs clearance, risks COPD/cancer; occupational mitigated but possible exposure; family predisposition), noting hemoptysis and need for malignancy vigilance. Generated Answer correctly notes smoking pack-a-day [P-37] and family history [P-42] but omits smoking start at age 15 [P-38]; critically, it falsely claims no occupational info in transcript despite clear evidence [P-33, P-34], contradicting Gold and transcript. Relations are partial (smoking irritant, family elevates cancer risk) but lack mechanisms, hemoptysis, and occupational link. Significant contradictions on occupational history.",
    "completeness": "Gold covers: smoking details/citation/effects; occupational details/citation/mitigation; family details/citation/predisposition; collective acute infection vs malignancy vigilance with hemoptysis. Generated covers smoking (partial, misses age), family (full), occupational (none, denies existence), partial relations (no mechanisms, no hemoptysis, no occupational). Misses ~60% including full smoking detail, entire occupational, detailed mechanisms, hemoptysis vigilance.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verifies smoking [P-37,38], occupational [P-33,34], family [P-42], symptoms. Generated citations accurate for covered parts but hallucinates absence of occupational history (directly in [P-33,34]); introduces unverifiable 'knowledge graph' and 'clinical documentation expert analysis' not in transcript; plausible but stretched cancer link from chest pain without hemoptysis mention. Multiple hallucinations/misreads.",
    "relevance": "Question requires relating all three specified risk factors (smoking from 15, chemical plant job, grandpa lung ca) to presentation and elicited details. Generated addresses presentation/symptoms well, elicits details for two factors accurately (partial for smoking), relates them somewhat, but ignores/denies third factor central to question and adds extraneous 'knowledge graph'/presentation summary; partially on-topic but incomplete."
