  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links eczema to atopic risk for asthma/reactive airways explaining intermittent cough, cat allergy as supporting atopy with hyperresponsiveness but no documented exposure, vaping as irritant impairing defenses exacerbating sensitivity, combination lowering threshold for chronic inflammation to acute infection, notes no formal testing. Generated aligns on core mechanisms (atopy from eczema, cat allergy supporting atopy, vaping irritation) and collective lowering of threshold, but introduces unmentioned vaping chemicals (propylene glycol etc.), implies stronger cat exposure trigger than Gold's caution, and omits progression to acute sputum and lack of testing. Minor discrepancies, core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: eczema/atopy → asthma risk/intermittent cough; cat allergy → atopy/hyperresponsiveness, no exposure documented; vaping → irritation/inflammation/impaired defenses; combo → lowered threshold/chronic inflammation → acute infection; no testing. Generated covers atopy/eczema priming, cat allergy trigger, vaping chronic irritation, collective lowered threshold/chronic inflammation/symptoms; misses explicit asthma risk, caution on cat exposure, acute progression via greenish sputum, no testing. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites transcript accurately for cat [P-27], vaping [P-36], symptoms [P-2,P-3,P-19,P-47]; claims like atopy from eczema, irritant effects plausible and verifiable indirectly via history. Hallucinates specific vaping chemicals (propylene glycol, nicotine not specified), assumes cat dander exposure and IgE response details, mentions 'knowledge graph' absent from transcript. Minor unverifiable details, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly breaks down the three specified factors (eczema, cat allergy, marijuana vaping), explains individual and collective contributions to chronic/recurrent respiratory susceptibility with symptom links, no off-topic content."
