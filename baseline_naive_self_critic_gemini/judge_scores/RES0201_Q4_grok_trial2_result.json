    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer accurately lists denied symptoms (cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell, fever, chills/night sweats) with citations, plus contextual denials (prior breathing issues, sick contacts, travel), and cautious interpretation of differentials favoring COVID suspicion despite negatives. Generated Answer incorrectly claims patient denied trouble breathing (contradicts transcript [P-7,P-8,P-9,P-10] where it's a key positive symptom), only partially notes loss of smell denial but misses all other listed symptoms, wrongly states trouble breathing as negative and attributes issues to swallowing only, fabricates differentiation logic (e.g., no smell loss rules out COVID, which contradicts Gold and doctor's COVID suspicion [D-43]), and pushes ungrounded mono recurrence. Multiple significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 7 specific denied symptoms (cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell, fever, chills/night sweats), 3 contextual denials, no explicit differentials but screening interpretations (e.g., away from URI, relevant to breathing diff, doesn't rule out COVID), mono history noted. Generated covers only loss of smell denial (~1/10 key points), wrongly adds nonexistent 'trouble breathing denial', mentions loss of taste (not denied fully), ignores vast majority including cough/runny nose (URI distinction), fever/chills, etc., and mangles differential section with unsupported mono focus. Covers <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verified: Loss of smell denial correct [P-19]; loss of taste partial [P-19,P-20]. Hallucinations: Patient 'did not report trouble breathing' (false, explicit in [P-7-P-11]); differentiates from COVID via anosmia absence (plausible but misapplies as 'rules out', ignores doctor's COVID plan [D-43]); 'knowledge graph' not in transcript; mono as primary differential unsupported (history only [P-5], not pursued). Trouble breathing fabrication central, multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response around 'symptoms screened and denials' and 'differential distinction from COVID-19', directly mirroring question parts; no off-topic tangents like lifestyle/history; minor irrelevant inclusions (swallowing reframing, knowledge graph) but core focus matches question despite errors."
