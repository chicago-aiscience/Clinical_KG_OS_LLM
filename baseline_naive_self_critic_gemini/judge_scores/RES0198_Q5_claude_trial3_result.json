  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It states the patient lives 'in their apartment' when the transcript shows they live with a nephew who goes to daycare [P-11, P-33]. Most critically, it completely misses the key infectious exposure source identified in the social history - the nephew who attends daycare. The answer incorrectly focuses on isolation recommendations rather than identifying the daycare exposure mentioned in P-11. While it correctly identifies type 1 diabetes, it fails to note that the doctor did NOT explicitly link diabetes to infection risk in the transcript, which the Gold Answer correctly observes.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 50% of the Gold Answer's key points. It misses: (1) the nephew who attends daycare as the primary exposure source, (2) the fact that daycares are common sources of respiratory infections, (3) that the nephew had not been sick per patient report, (4) specific details about diabetes management (diagnosed at age 7, sees endocrinologist), (5) the critical observation that the doctor did NOT explicitly discuss diabetes-related immune implications, (6) symptom persistence for a full week prompting the visit. It only partially covers the diabetes diagnosis and viral URI assessment.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains factual inaccuracies not supported by the transcript. The statement about living 'in their apartment' contradicts P-11 where the patient says 'I have um a nephew who I live with.' The answer fabricates a connection between diabetes and the isolation recommendation ('necessitating isolation to minimize infection risk') that the doctor never made in D-39. The isolation was recommended due to COVID-19 concerns, not diabetes. The answer also fails to cite the specific location where the exposure source (nephew/daycare) is mentioned.",
    "relevance": "The answer partially addresses the question but misses the primary focus. The question asks about 'potential infectious exposure source identified through social history' - the nephew/daycare exposure is the answer, but this is completely absent. Instead, the response focuses on diagnosis and management recommendations. While it mentions diabetes and immune function, it doesn't accurately characterize how this factor relates to the presentation (the doctor made no explicit connection in the transcript)."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fails to identify the key infectious exposure source (nephew attending daycare) mentioned in the social history and contains factual errors about living arrangements. It misses most of the Gold Answer's critical points and fabricates connections between diabetes and isolation that the doctor never made. The response is only partially relevant as it focuses on diagnosis/management rather than addressing the exposure source question directly."
