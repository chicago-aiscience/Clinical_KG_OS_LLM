  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol (acetaminophen) as the at-home medication and correctly states it was used for headache relief (supported by P-3/P-4). It accurately summarizes the doctor’s recommended symptomatic medications (Tylenol for fever; Tylenol or NSAIDs for aches) and supportive measures (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, 14-day isolation) from D-52. No incorrect medications or unsupported treatments are added. Minor issue: it cites P-1 for Tylenol use even though Tylenol use is specifically mentioned in P-3/P-4, but the underlying fact is still correct.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points: (1) Tylenol taken at home, (2) symptom targeted (headache), (3) supportive care (hydration, nutrition, sleep), (4) isolation for 14 days, (5) Tylenol/NSAIDs guidance. Misses two items included in the Gold Answer: the COVID swab/test being ordered and the patient’s own supportive measure (trying to keep hydrated) prior to the visit. It also does not explicitly note that no prescription medications were ordered (present in Gold).",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by the transcript (especially D-52 and P-3/P-4). The only notable faithfulness issue is an inaccurate citation ([P-1]) for the patient taking Tylenol; the transcript supports Tylenol use but in different turns (P-3/P-4). No clear hallucinated treatments.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what medication was taken at home and for what symptom, and what additional medications and supportive measures were recommended. Content is focused with no meaningful tangents."
