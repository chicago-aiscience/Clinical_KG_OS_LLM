  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the bronchodilator as the sole medication. However, it fails significantly on the other two parts of the question. It claims the administration method is not specified, but the transcript explicitly identifies it as a 'puffer' in segments D-7 and P-7. It also claims the doctor never asked about a daily controller medication, but segment D-5 shows the doctor asking, 'do you have one that you take every day no matter what?', which the Gold Answer identifies as the daily controller.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer only successfully addresses the first part of the three-part question (the name of the medication). It fails to provide the administration method and fails to identify the query regarding the daily controller, incorrectly stating this information is missing.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains 'negative hallucinations' by asserting that specific information (administration and the daily controller question) is not in the transcript when it clearly is. This demonstrates a failure to correctly parse the provided source text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant in its structure, as it attempts to address each component of the user's prompt directly, even though most of the content is factually incorrect based on the source."
