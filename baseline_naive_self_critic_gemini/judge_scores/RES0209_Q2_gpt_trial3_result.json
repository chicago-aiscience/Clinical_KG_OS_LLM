  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient’s only asthma medication is a bronchodilator/rescue medication. However, it contains major factual errors versus the Gold Answer and transcript: (1) it incorrectly states the route/administration is not specified, despite explicit confirmation that it is a “puffer” (inhaler) (D-7/P-7); and (2) it incorrectly claims the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication, despite D-5 (“one that you take every day no matter what?”) and the patient’s denial (P-5). These are central to the question, making the overall answer substantially incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are missing or misstated: (1) administration via puffer/inhaler (missed/denied), (2) the medication is used as-needed (not clearly stated), (3) the clinician explicitly asked about a daily medication/controller and the patient does not have it (missed/denied), and (4) explicit denial of any other medications (not included as a key supporting point). Only the “sole medication is a bronchodilator” element is captured, so coverage is well under 50%.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not faithful to the transcript: it states the transcript does not specify administration route and does not include a doctor question about daily controller medication—both directly contradicted by D-7/P-7 and D-5/P-5. The mention of a “knowledge graph” is also not grounded in the provided transcript. Some trigger details (exercise/cold/pollen) are supported, but the major contradictions reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked elements (current asthma medication, administration, daily controller medication asked about). It does not introduce substantial off-topic material, though it adds unnecessary trigger discussion. Overall it is on-topic even though incorrect."

  "summary": "The answer is on-topic and correctly notes a bronchodilator as the only asthma medication, but it wrongly denies key transcript facts about inhaler (“puffer”) administration and the clinician’s explicit question about a daily controller medication, making it incomplete and not faithful."
