  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims that the patient did not explicitly deny symptoms like chest pain, sore throat, chills, and GI complaints, whereas the transcript shows the mother explicitly saying 'No' or 'No, I don't think so' to these questions (P-13, P-14, P-19, P-22, P-23). It also misses several reported symptoms included in the Gold Answer, such as decreased appetite, loss of taste, and a runny nose.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses about 50% of the key points. It fails to list the positive symptoms of runny nose, appetite changes, and taste changes. Furthermore, it fails to fulfill the second part of the prompt (listing denied symptoms) by incorrectly asserting that they were not denied.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer misinterprets the transcript. It claims there are no explicit denials for several symptoms, which is directly contradicted by the transcript. This constitutes a failure in faithfulness to the source text.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant in structure as it attempts to address both parts of the prompt (reported and denied symptoms), but the content within those sections is inaccurate."
