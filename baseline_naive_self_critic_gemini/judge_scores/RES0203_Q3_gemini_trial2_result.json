  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough) and the diagnostic test (swab) mentioned in the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly cites the relevant dialogue turns.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary symptoms and the test method. However, it misses a key part of the gold answer's explanation: how the doctor used the absence of other symptoms (fever, difficulty breathing, etc.) to narrow the diagnosis. It also omits the patient's initial suspicion of COVID-19.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is grounded in the transcript. It mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context, but the information extracted remains consistent with the provided transcript text.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by identifying the symptoms, the doctor's reasoning, and the specific test method."
