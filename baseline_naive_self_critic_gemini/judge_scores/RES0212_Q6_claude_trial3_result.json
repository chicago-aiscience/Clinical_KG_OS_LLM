  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript does not contain the doctor's plan, assessment, or next steps, stating it ends at [P-47]. This is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly includes [D-47] and [D-48], where the doctor provides a summary assessment ('cough for a little while but only become bad in the last three days,' 'bringing up this greenish sputum,' 'no constitutional symptoms') and states the plan to 'go review your story with the doctors.' The Generated Answer fundamentally misreads the source material by missing these critical exchanges.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the Gold Answer's key points. It fails to mention: (1) the doctor's summary assessment in [D-47], (2) the characterization of the cough duration and recent worsening, (3) the sputum description, (4) the absence of constitutional symptoms, (5) the plan to review with supervising doctors, (6) the indication this was a trainee encounter, (7) the lack of specific diagnostic orders, or (8) that next steps depend on the supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript ends at [P-47] and that no doctor turns follow. The transcript explicitly shows [D-47] and [D-48] exist. The claim that 'the doctor's stated plan, summary assessment, and information guiding next steps are not available' directly contradicts the transcript evidence. This represents a significant failure in faithfulness to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question about the doctor's plan, assessment, and guiding information, but does so by incorrectly claiming this information is absent. While it is addressing the right topic area, the response is not useful because it provides an incorrect non-answer rather than extracting the available information from [D-47] and [D-48]."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains a fundamental error by claiming the transcript ends at [P-47] and lacks the doctor's conclusion, when in fact [D-47] and [D-48] clearly provide the doctor's summary assessment and plan. It misses all key elements: the characterization of the cough's timeline, the description of greenish sputum without blood, the absence of constitutional symptoms, the plan to review with supervising doctors, and the indication this was a trainee encounter. This represents a complete failure to extract information clearly present in the source transcript."
