  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies Lipitor for high cholesterol (correctly matched) and Tylenol for symptom relief related to feeling feverish/unwell with partial effectiveness ('helps a little bit'). Generated Answer correctly identifies both medications and their categories (prescribed/OTC), cholesterol condition, and effectiveness, but inaccurately states Tylenol is 'to treat a cough' (Tylenol is antipyretic/analgesic; transcript context is broader symptoms post-fever discussion, not specifically cough treatment). Minor discrepancy as core facts (meds, cholesterol, partial help) align, no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Lipitor (prescribed, cholesterol), only prescribed med confirmed, Tylenol (OTC, feverish symptoms, helps little), no others mentioned. Generated covers Lipitor/cholesterol, Tylenol/partial effectiveness; misses explicit 'only med' confirmation and non-med sputum relief (question focuses on meds), covers ~90% core med details.",
    "faithfulness": "Lipitor claims directly verifiable [P-25,P-26]; Tylenol mention/effectiveness verifiable [P-14]; however, 'to treat a cough' not directly stated (linked via [P-1] cough complaint but [P-14] follows general relief query after sputum/fever); 'provided knowledge graph' not in transcript/input (hallucination). Mostly grounded with minor unverifiable purpose link and extraneous reference.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly lists prescribed/OTC meds, conditions, OTC effectiveness with evidence, perfectly matching question without off-topic content."
