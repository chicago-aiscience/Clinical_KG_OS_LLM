  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies both medication non-adherence (forgetting Keppra) and hereditary factors (maternal epilepsy) as risk factors. It accurately quotes P-9 and P-26. However, it lacks specific details present in the Gold Answer, such as the medication name (Keppra), the dinner-time dosing routine, the daughter's birthday context, and the patient's acknowledgment that seizures are normally infrequent when medication is taken. The core facts are accurate but less detailed.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main elements: medication-related risk (forgotten dose) and hereditary risk (maternal epilepsy), plus their relationship to the epilepsy diagnosis. However, it omits several key contextual details from the Gold Answer: (1) specific medication name (Keppra), (2) the daughter's birthday celebration as the reason for missed dose, (3) usual dinner-time dosing schedule, (4) patient's acknowledgment that seizures are normally infrequent, suggesting good control with medication, and (5) the direct quote 'I think that might have yeah' showing patient's insight. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations [P-9] and [P-26] are accurate. The mention of 'knowledge graph' suggests external information was used, but the actual content provided is grounded in the transcript. No hallucinated facts are present. The answer appropriately references P-8 for the epilepsy diagnosis and P-26 for family history.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) hereditary and medication-related risk factors for the seizure, and (2) how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. It stays focused on the question without tangential information. The structure clearly separates medication-related, hereditary, and diagnostic relationship aspects as requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the core risk factors (medication non-adherence and maternal family history of epilepsy) and their relationship to the patient's diagnosis. All information is faithfully grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it lacks important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific medication name (Keppra), the birthday celebration context for the missed dose, and the patient's insight about normally infrequent seizures when compliant. While factually correct and highly relevant, the answer would benefit from greater completeness in capturing the clinical narrative details."
