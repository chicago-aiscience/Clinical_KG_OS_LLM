  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. The Gold Answer clearly states that 'the initial presenting symptom was nasal congestion' [P-3] and that symptoms shifted 'from congestion to rhinorrhea' [P-3], directly contradicting the Generated Answer's claim that symptoms started concurrently with no change in predominance. Most critically, the Generated Answer incorrectly states symptoms were 'intermittent,' while the patient explicitly clarified symptoms were 'pretty constant for the past week' [P-8]. This is a major factual error.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses multiple key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the clear chronological progression from stuffy to runny, (2) the role of decongestants in the symptom transition, (3) the clarification that despite initial 'on and off' description, symptoms were actually constant, and (4) the lack of improvement prompting the visit. It covers basic timeline but omits essential details about symptom evolution.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript. While [P-1] mentions 'on and off,' the Generated Answer fails to include the critical clarification in [P-8] where the patient states symptoms were 'pretty constant.' Additionally, [P-3] clearly states 'It felt pretty stuffy at first, but now it's mostly running,' which the Generated Answer ignores, claiming no predominant symptom change. This represents selective use of transcript evidence.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's core components (chronology, first symptom, predominant symptom change, constant vs. intermittent) but provides incorrect information for most of them. While structurally relevant to the question asked, the inaccurate content significantly diminishes its value."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates poor correctness and faithfulness by contradicting key facts from the transcript. It incorrectly claims symptoms started concurrently (when congestion clearly came first per P-3), incorrectly states no predominant symptom change occurred (when transcript shows shift from stuffy to runny), and most critically, incorrectly characterizes symptoms as intermittent (when patient explicitly clarified they were 'pretty constant' in P-8). The answer also lacks completeness, omitting the role of decongestants and the important clarification about symptom constancy. While the response is structurally relevant to the question, the multiple factual errors severely undermine its clinical utility."
