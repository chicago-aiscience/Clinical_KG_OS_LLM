  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states the onset was ~3 days prior and characterizes the symptom as chest tightness worse with inspiration, and notes worsening with walking, standing from a chair, and deep breaths (all supported by P-1, P-9). However, it contains important inaccuracies: (1) it does not accurately report the course as “staying the same/pretty steady” and instead describes it as “persistent but intermittent,” which conflicts with the patient’s description of steadiness (P-2, P-3, P-9); (2) it incorrectly states the patient “maintains their normal daily walking routine,” whereas the transcript says the patient reduced from a couple of walks/day to typically one walk/day (P-22). It also fails to clearly state that the very first notice of symptoms occurred during a walk (P-4).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: started ~3 days ago; baseline tightness present much of the time; worse with walking, getting up from a chair, and deep breaths; tightness notable on inspiration. Key elements missed or inadequately addressed: explicit statement that symptoms have been “staying the same/pretty steady”; that nothing in particular triggered onset (“just kind of came on”); clear mention that first noticed while out walking; the functional impact that walking decreased from a couple walks/day to one; and that it did not cause missed work and only mildly limited day-to-day functioning.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple issues: it introduces “Knowledge graph data… [KG]” which is not present in the transcript (hallucinated source). It also claims the patient maintains the normal walking routine, which contradicts P-22. Most other statements are grounded in the transcript, but these errors materially reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on the asked domains (onset context, trajectory, exacerbating factors, impact on walking). The “knowledge graph” mention is a minor tangent, but overall it attempts to answer the question."
