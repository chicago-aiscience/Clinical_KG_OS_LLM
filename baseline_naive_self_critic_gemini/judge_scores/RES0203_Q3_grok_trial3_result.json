  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three key symptoms (anosmia/loss of smell, ageusia/loss of taste, dry cough) matching the Gold Answer. It accurately quotes the doctor's connection in D-39 and the swab test method. However, it omits the patient's initial COVID concern (P-1), the doctor's confirmation of absent symptoms (e.g., no fever, no SOB), and the 'pretty well' summary (D-16), introducing minor discrepancies in fully mirroring the Gold's explanatory depth.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: symptoms (loss of smell/taste/cough), doctor's connection via D-39 quote, swab test order (D-39). Missed: patient's initial COVID worry (P-1), systematic ruling out of other symptoms (fever P-10, SOB P-11, sore throat P-13, chest pain P-22), 'pretty well' summary (D-16), narrow symptom profile rationale, self-isolation emphasis (D-39). Covers core ~60-70% of Gold points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms verifiable in P-1/P-4/P-7; doctor's quote and swab test accurate in D-39. Medical terms anosmia/ageusia appropriate for described symptoms. However, 'knowledge graph provided' and 'procedure `covid test` in knowledge graph' are not in transcript—hallucinated additions, introducing unverifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom combination, doctor's connection to COVID suspicion, and test method (swab). Knowledge graph mentions are minor off-topic tangents but do not derail focus on question."
