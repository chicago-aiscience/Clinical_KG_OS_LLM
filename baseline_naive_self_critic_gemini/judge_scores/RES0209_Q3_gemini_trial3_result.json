  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the four symptoms and the escalation in bronchodilator use as signs of worsening asthma. However, it contains a minor error in turn citation, attributing chest tightness to [P-16] instead of [P-20]. It also introduces a 'Knowledge Graph' framework that is not present in the source material, though the clinical associations it makes are factually consistent with the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a critical component of the gold answer's reasoning: the differential diagnosis. The gold answer explains why it is *not* a new condition by listing several negative findings (no fever, no sick contacts, no travel, no productive cough, etc.). The generated answer focuses only on why it *is* asthma, failing to address the 'rather than a new respiratory condition' part of the prompt with the same level of evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript regarding the patient's symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing). However, it 'hallucinates' the existence of a 'clinical knowledge graph' as a source of information, which is not provided in the prompt or transcript. It also misattributes the confirmation of chest tightness to turn [P-16] when it occurred at [P-20].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question. It structures its response around the specific symptoms and medication usage mentioned in the prompt."
