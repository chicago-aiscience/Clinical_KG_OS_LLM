  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the medications the patient does take (Reactine and OTC) and the lack of prescribed medications. However, it fails to explicitly state that the patient takes nothing for her current respiratory episodes (wheezing), which is a key fact in the Gold Answer and the transcript [P-34].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two significant points from the Gold Answer: 1) that no medication or treatment is used for the current respiratory episodes (they resolve with rest), and 2) that past infections over the last two years did not require antibiotics. It covers about 60% of the key clinical information.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript. The inclusion of the phrase 'Knowledge Graph' is an external reference not found in the source, but the medical claims associated with it are accurate to the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is directly relevant to the question, specifically addressing the medications taken and the status of prescribed management."
