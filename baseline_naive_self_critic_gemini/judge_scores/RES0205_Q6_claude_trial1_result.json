  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor's plan at D-37, which includes performing a physical examination (listening to heart and lungs, quick physical exam), consulting with a supervising doctor, and returning to discuss next steps. The Generated Answer claims this information is not present, which directly contradicts the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) the specific physical examination components mentioned (heart and lungs auscultation), (2) the collaborative consultation process with the supervising physician, (3) the plan to review findings and return to discuss next steps, and (4) the connection to the initial framing at D-1. Coverage is 0%.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a false claim that contradicts the transcript. It states the consultation does not contain the doctor's plan, when D-37 explicitly provides this information. This represents a significant failure to accurately represent the source material, though it's more of a misreading than hallucination of non-existent content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question. Instead of describing what the doctor's plan was (which is clearly stated in D-37), it incorrectly claims the information is absent. This is completely off-target from what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally fails the evaluation by incorrectly claiming the requested information is not present in the transcript, when in fact D-37 clearly contains the doctor's stated plan including physical examination components (heart and lungs auscultation) and the collaborative consultation process. This represents a critical misreading of the source material, resulting in 0% coverage of the Gold Answer's key points and complete failure to address the question asked."
