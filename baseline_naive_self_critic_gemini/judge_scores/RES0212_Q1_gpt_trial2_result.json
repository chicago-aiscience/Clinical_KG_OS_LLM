  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most included details match the transcript/Gold Answer: 3-month intermittent cough, greenish “gunk” sputum, cough-related chest discomfort, fatigue, sleep disruption, and exercise limitation are all supported. However, the answer implicitly frames “gross” as a cough descriptor (the patient primarily described the sputum/coughing up gunk as gross), and it omits/does not clearly state several key symptom characteristics (initially dry cough, timing of productive sputum ~3 days, nightly waking for the last month, subjective fever). These are mainly omissions rather than direct contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covered: chronic/intermittent cough (partial), productive green sputum (partial), cough-related discomfort, fatigue/sleep disturbance, exercise limitation, and one explicit denial (pain beyond cough).\nMissed major Gold Answer points: initial dry cough and its onset context (pole dancing class); change to productive cough over ~3 days; no blood in sputum; no foul smell; subjective fever/feeling hot at night; explicit denials of night sweats, weight loss/loose clothes, hemoptysis, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, and denial of sick contacts (class/recent/home). Overall, well under 50% of required key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements are largely grounded in the transcript. The phrase “Based on the transcript and knowledge graph” introduces an unverifiable source (“knowledge graph”) not present in the transcript, but it does not lead to additional fabricated clinical details. No major hallucinated symptoms are added; the main issue is missing information rather than invented content.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic (respiratory symptoms, cough/sputum, associated symptoms, and denials), but it fails to answer the full scope of the question—especially the explicit denials and sputum/cough characteristics requested—so it is only partially responsive."
