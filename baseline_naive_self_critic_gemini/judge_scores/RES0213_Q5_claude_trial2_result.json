  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the three main factors (family history, smoking, psychosocial stress) and their interaction. The father's heart attack in his 50s is correctly cited [P-8], smoking history is accurately described with citations [P-13, P-18], and psychosocial stressors are properly documented [P-15, P-19]. However, there are minor discrepancies: the Gold Answer mentions the father sees 'a lot of heart doctors' [P-30] and mentions anxiety attacks returning [P-22], which are absent from the Generated Answer. The Generated Answer includes some interpretative elements (e.g., 'cycle of somatic symptom perception') not explicitly in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 85% of the Gold Answer's key points. It addresses all three main factors and their interactions. However, it omits: (1) the specific detail about father seeing 'a lot of heart doctors' [P-30], (2) the paternal grandfather's unknown cardiac history [P-30], (3) the specific cigarette count reduction from 10 to 5 per day, (4) the anxiety attacks from teenage years potentially returning [P-22], (5) living alone in London [P-26, P-27], and (6) being nervous about running [P-28]. The Generated Answer adds organizational structure and interpretation not present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The claims about family history [P-8], smoking [P-13, P-18], and stress [P-15, P-19] are all verifiable. However, there are some interpretative elements that go beyond the transcript: 'cycle of somatic symptom perception' is an inference not stated by the patient, and the phrase 'genetic or hereditary risk factor' is more definitive than warranted by the transcript. The reference to 'knowledge graph' appears twice but is not part of the source material provided. The claim about 'self-medication' is supported but the interpretation that symptoms are 'not merely psychogenic' adds clinical judgment beyond the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all components of the question. It systematically examines family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors, and explicitly discusses their interactions. The structure (numbered sections for each factor plus an 'Interaction' section) directly maps to the question's requirements. Minor tangential content includes the 'knowledge graph' references and some clinical interpretations that, while relevant, go slightly beyond what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a well-structured, accurate response that addresses all main components of the question with appropriate citations. It correctly identifies the three factors (family history, smoking, psychosocial stress) and their interactions, with evidence from the transcript. Minor weaknesses include omission of some specific details from the Gold Answer (father seeing heart doctors, anxiety attacks returning, living alone, nervous about running) and inclusion of interpretative elements not fully grounded in the transcript (e.g., 'knowledge graph' references, 'cycle of somatic symptom perception'). The answer is highly relevant and covers approximately 85% of the Gold Answer's key points with strong factual accuracy."
