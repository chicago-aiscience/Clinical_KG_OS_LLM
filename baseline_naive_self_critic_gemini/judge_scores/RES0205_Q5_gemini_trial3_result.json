  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it states that the cough outlasted symptoms 'such as fever', whereas the patient explicitly denied having a fever in transcript [P-12]. It correctly identifies the role of acid reflux and hay fever in persistent cough, consistent with the gold answer's clinical reasoning.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all three requested factors (acid reflux, hay fever, and occupation). It misses the gold answer's point regarding the patient's anxiety history as a motivator for the visit, although it mentions the coworkers' fear in the occupational section.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source of information, which is not present in the provided transcript. Furthermore, it attributes a fever to the patient that was explicitly denied in the source text [P-12].",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, structured specifically around the three components requested in the question and provides a clinical explanation for each."
