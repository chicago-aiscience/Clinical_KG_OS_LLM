  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All included elements match the Gold Answer and transcript: COVID swab with 24–48h turnaround, isolation for 14 days, isolation specifically from the younger sister, and ER escalation criteria (high temperature; neurologic symptoms including seizures; weakness/dizziness; fainting). No contradictory or incorrect statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Covers the main management actions (COVID test + timeframe; 14-day isolation; isolate from younger sister; ER return precautions). Misses several Gold Answer points: possibility of false-negative COVID result, alternative diagnosis of another circulating viral illness if negative, supportive/observational approach with no medications prescribed, and the school’s requirement for a COVID test to return.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are directly supported by the transcript (primarily D-44). No apparent hallucinations or additions beyond what was stated.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question about management measures, diagnostic testing, isolation instructions/duration, and who to isolate from, without irrelevant content."
