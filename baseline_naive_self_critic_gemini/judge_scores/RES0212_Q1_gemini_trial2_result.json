  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer regarding the symptoms it chooses to include. It correctly identifies the cough duration (3 months), the recurring nature, the 'greenish gunk' sputum, the sleep disruption, fatigue, and the exercise limitation. It also correctly notes the distinction between chest pain during coughing versus general pain.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. While it covers the positive respiratory symptoms well, it misses several key components from the gold answer: it does not mention that the cough was initially dry, it omits the patient's report of subjective fevers ('feeling hot at night'), and it fails to mention that the sputum had no blood or foul smell. Most importantly, it fails to list the majority of symptoms explicitly denied by the patient (night sweats, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts), mentioning only the denial of general body pain.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All claims, including the patient's descriptions ('gross', 'gunk', 'kinds of waking me up'), are directly supported by the text and cited correctly with patient turn numbers.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's multi-part question regarding respiratory symptoms, sputum characteristics, and denied symptoms. However, its failure to provide a thorough list of denials reduces its overall utility in answering the prompt comprehensively as requested by 'which symptoms did she explicitly deny'. Only mentioning pain is a partial response to that specific instruction. Despite this, the content provided is entirely on-topic and focused on the query's requirements without irrelevant tangents. I am giving it a 4 as it misses a major portion of the instruction set but what is provided is relevant to the question asked."
