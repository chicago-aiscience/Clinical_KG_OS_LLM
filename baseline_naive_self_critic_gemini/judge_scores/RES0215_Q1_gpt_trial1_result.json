  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the presenting symptoms of wheeze, shortness of breath, slight cough, and being out of breath with activity, consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. However, it is not fully correct about the *earliest* symptoms: when asked what was noticed first at onset, the mother reported **both wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths** (difficulty taking in deep breaths), whereas the generated answer states only that wheezing was earliest. This conflicts with the Gold Answer’s key point that two symptoms were earliest.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: wheeze, shortness of breath, slight cough, exertional “out of breath.” Key points missed/under-emphasized for the question: the onset/earliest symptoms were **wheezing AND difficulty taking deep breaths** (the answer includes difficulty taking deep breaths in the symptom list but fails to name it as an earliest symptom, which is central to the question). It also omits other respiratory characterizations from Gold (hard time catching breath; no cyanosis; nonproductive cough), though these are secondary to the question compared with the onset detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All included symptoms (wheeze, slight cough, short of breath, out of breath with tag, difficulty taking deep breaths) are supported by the transcript. The statement that wheeze was present over the whole 4–5 day period is supported by P-1. The main issue is omission rather than fabrication; no clear hallucinated facts are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the respiratory symptoms and addresses both parts of the question (symptoms at presentation and earliest symptoms), with minimal extraneous content."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and well-grounded on presenting symptoms, but it misses that difficulty taking deep breaths (along with wheeze) was also reported as an earliest onset symptom, reducing correctness and completeness."
