  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the source transcript and Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the timeline (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening) and the details of the prior tick bite (10 years ago, bullseye rash, antibiotics, engorged tick).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few specific details included in the Gold Answer: it does not mention the location (Strathroy), the doctor's estimate that the tick had been attached for 'at least 72 hours', or the explicit confirmation that the current bite lacked the 'larger circle rash' (though it implies this by describing current symptoms as localized redness).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims, including the description of the tick's engorgement and the patient's symptoms, are supported by the text. Citations are used appropriately.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the timeline of exposure and the comparison between the current and past episodes."
