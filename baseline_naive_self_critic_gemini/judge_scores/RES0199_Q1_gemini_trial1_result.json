  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains one factual error regarding the onset of diarrhea. It states diarrhea began roughly 4 days ago, whereas the transcript (P-28) and Gold Answer specify it started 2 days ago. Other facts, such as the cough nature, vomiting frequency, and headache severity, are accurate.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer, including the absence of sputum/blood in the cough, respiratory negatives (SOB, wheezing, chest pain), GI negatives (bloating, gas, constipation), the specific location of the headache (bilateral forehead), and the loss of smell/fatigue symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript. However, it misinterprets P-1 regarding the diarrhea timeline; while the overall illness started 4 days ago, the diarrhea specifically started 2 days ago as clarified in P-28. Citations are otherwise used correctly.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on the symptoms and characteristics requested in the prompt, including the cough, diarrhea frequency, vomiting episodes, and headache severity."
