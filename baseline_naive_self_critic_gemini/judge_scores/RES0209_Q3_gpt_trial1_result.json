  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key asthma symptom cluster (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheeze, chest tightness) and links increased bronchodilator use and symptom relief from bronchodilator to worsening asthma, which is consistent with the Gold Answer. However, it contains minor inaccuracies/weak support: it implies chest tightness is inferred from P-16 rather than directly citing the explicit confirmation at P-20, and it does not state the specific increase from “once every two weeks” to “5–6 times per week.” It also overstates certainty (“confirms”) without incorporating the Gold Answer’s supporting exclusion of infectious causes.",
    "completeness": "Covers some key Gold Answer points: the classic asthma symptom profile, bronchodilator providing relief, and increased rescue inhaler use suggesting worsening control. Misses several major supporting elements from the Gold Answer: established asthma diagnosis since age 8, wheezing occurring even more often than bronchodilator use, known triggers (exercise/cold air), and the negative infectious/COVID screen (no fever, sick contacts, travel, anosmia, productive cough, etc.) that supports “worsening asthma rather than a new respiratory condition.” Overall this is ~50–70% of the Gold Answer’s key support.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated references to a “clinical knowledge graph” and specific KG relations (e.g., “[dry cough --RELATED_TO--> asthma]”) are fabricated. Additionally, the chest tightness discussion is partly misattributed to P-16 rather than the explicit P-20 confirmation. While many symptom statements are grounded in the transcript, the added KG framework is a substantial hallucinated component.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked symptom combination and increased bronchodilator use as pointing to worsening asthma. The main detraction is the unnecessary “knowledge graph” framing and not engaging the ‘rather than a new respiratory condition’ aspect via the transcript’s negative infection screening. Still, the content remains mostly on-topic."
