  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly states the cough began ~4–5 days before the visit and preceded the runny nose by a couple of days, consistent with the Gold Answer.\n- Correctly notes the runny nose had clear discharge.\n- However, it does not accurately capture the key severity trajectory from the transcript/Gold Answer: that the cough had “kind of stayed the same” (neither better nor worse). It only states it is persistent/not improving.\n- It omits the cough being explicitly dry and non-productive throughout, which is a central factual descriptor in the Gold Answer.\n- It inaccurately says the cough duration is “confirmed…in [P-5]”; [P-5] confirms dryness, not duration.\n- The asthma-related comparison is broadly consistent with the transcript, but it does not substitute for the Gold Answer’s comparison to the patient’s own prior similar episodes (never had a dry cough like this; prior runny noses didn’t last this long).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered:\n- Cough onset ~4–5 days prior and first symptom.\n- Runny nose began later (past couple of days) and is clear.\n\nKey Gold Answer elements missed:\n- Cough characterized as dry.\n- Cough non-productive/no sputum throughout.\n- Explicit statement that cough severity stayed the same since onset.\n- Comparison to prior experiences: never had a dry cough like this; prior runny noses occurred but didn’t last this long.\n\nAdditional items included that are not key to the question/Gold Answer:\n- Denials of other symptoms (sore throat, nausea/vomiting, headache).",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are supported by the transcript.\n- Minor citation/grounding problem: the answer claims the 4–5 day duration is confirmed in [P-5], which does not support duration.\n- The phrasing that the patient was “worked up for asthma without results” is a reasonable inference from the mother’s statement, but not explicitly worded that way.\n- No major hallucinated events or timelines beyond these minor issues.",
    "relevance": "- Generally addresses the requested symptom timeline (cough vs runny nose timing) and some comparison context.\n- Adds a section on other negative symptoms that is not asked for and distracts slightly.\n- The comparison to prior experiences is incomplete and shifts toward family/asthma history rather than the patient’s own reported prior similar symptoms."
