  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as the diagnosis, aligning with the Gold Answer's 'pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the context of an atopic predisposition.' Core facts match, including triggers, resolution, cold weather, and allergies. Minor discrepancies: omits 'pediatric' specifier, explicit 'atopic predisposition' phrasing, nocturnal episode, multiple settings emphasis, and pertinent negatives, but no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: exercise-triggered (partial: P-3, implies P-6), resolution with rest (P-6), cold weather (P-38), seasonal allergies (P-35). Missed: full exercise details (P-41), across multiple settings explicitly cited (P-38), nocturnal episode (P-43/P-44), pertinent negatives (P-7, P-8, P-10, P-31). Covers ~60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., P-1 wheezing/SOB/cough, P-2 deep breaths, P-3 activity, P-6 rest/resolution, P-35 allergies, P-38 cold). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; diagnosis is plausible and grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by stating the diagnosis and providing transcript-supported findings with citations, matching the required format without off-topic content."
