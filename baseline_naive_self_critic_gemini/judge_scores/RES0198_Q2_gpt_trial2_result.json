{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer: the patient tried OTC decongestants, assessed they helped “a little bit,” and the doctor recommended an OTC product specifically mentioning Tylenol Cold. No contradictions or factual errors relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It includes the three core elements (decongestants tried, modest benefit, Tylenol Cold recommendation). It omits additional supportive-care/context elements present in the Gold Answer (hydration advice and expectation that symptoms may take a few weeks to resolve). Thus it captures most, but not all, Gold Answer points.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript: decongestants and “worked a little bit” from [P-10], and Tylenol Cold recommendation from [D-39]. No hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question (prior medication tried, perceived effectiveness, and recommended OTC treatment) with no irrelevant tangents."
