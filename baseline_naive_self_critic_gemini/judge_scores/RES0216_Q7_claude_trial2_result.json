  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors when compared to the Gold Answer. Most significantly, it states the patient maintains their 'normal daily walking routine,' when the Gold Answer clearly indicates the patient reduced from 'a couple of walks per day' to 'typically just one walk daily' [P-22]. The Generated Answer also incorrectly describes progression as 'persistent but intermittent' when the Gold Answer correctly states symptoms are 'always there' at baseline but exacerbated by activity. The Generated Answer correctly identifies the 3-day timeline, walking as initial activity, and exacerbating factors, but misses the key detail that symptoms have been 'staying the same' rather than improving or worsening.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: the 3-day timeline, walking as the initial activity when symptoms appeared, exacerbating factors (walking, getting up from chair, deep breathing), and the constant baseline nature of symptoms. However, it completely omits critical information about: the specific reduction from 'couple of walks' to 'one walk daily' [P-22], no missed work time [P-21, P-22], the patient's semi-retired financial advisor status [P-21], and the agreement between patient and doctor that symptoms are 'noticeably limiting' usual activity [P-22, P-23]. It also fails to clearly state that symptoms have been 'staying the same' regarding progression.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination regarding the impact on daily routine. It states the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine,' which directly contradicts the transcript evidence in [P-22] where the patient explicitly states 'I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually.' The inclusion of '[KG]' references suggests fabricated knowledge graph citations not present in the source transcript. The description of progression as 'persistent but intermittent' is somewhat misleading compared to the transcript's clearer 'staying the same' and 'always kind of there' characterization. Most other claims are verifiable in the transcript, but this major error significantly impacts faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is mostly relevant and addresses the key components of the question: onset/development timeline, progression status, precipitating activity, exacerbating factors, and impact on walking routine. However, it provides less detail on some aspects (particularly the specific change in walking frequency) and includes some tangential information like knowledge graph references. The structure follows the question's requirements but could be more comprehensive in addressing how symptoms have 'affected' the walking routine versus simply maintaining it."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates moderate relevance and partial completeness but suffers from significant factual errors and faithfulness issues. The most critical error is the false claim that the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine' when the transcript clearly shows a reduction from multiple daily walks to typically one walk. This directly contradicts the question's focus on how symptoms affected the walking routine. The answer also mischaracterizes symptom progression and includes fabricated knowledge graph references. While it correctly identifies several key points (3-day timeline, walking as initial activity, exacerbating factors), these strengths are overshadowed by the major factual inaccuracies and incomplete coverage of important details like work impact and the patient's functional limitations."
