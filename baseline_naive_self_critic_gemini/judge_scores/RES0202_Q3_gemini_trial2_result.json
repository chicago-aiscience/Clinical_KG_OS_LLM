  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error by claiming the transcript does not document a change in taste. In turn [P-17], the mother specifically mentions that she wondered if the child was 'losing his sense of taste' because he was not into his breakfast. Additionally, the generated answer incorrectly states the symptoms lasted 'five days' based on the doctor's initial question [D-3], ignoring the parent's correction in [P-4] that it had been 3 days.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to include the 'change in taste' symptom, which was one of the three specific components requested in the question and included in the Gold Answer. It does successfully cover the respiratory complaint, temperature, and the logic regarding the infectious process (fever vs. asthma).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates the absence of information; it claims the symptom of taste is not in the transcript when it is clearly documented in [P-17]. This is a failure of grounding. It also relies on a refuted statement in the transcript (the 5-day duration) as a factual anchor.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant as it attempts to address the prompt's components, but it explicitly dismisses one of the required elements of the question, which reduces its overall relevance to the specific inquiry asked by the user."
