  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main respiratory symptoms from P-1 (wheezy, short of breath, slight cough) and P-3 (out of breath with activity), and links difficulty taking deep breaths from P-2 to both wheezy and short of breath. However, it inaccurately states that only 'wheezy' was the earliest symptom based on P-1 duration, contradicting the Gold Answer's emphasis on both wheezing AND difficulty taking deep breaths as the first noticed per P-2. It misses nuances like cough being recent/non-productive (P-1, P-31), hard time catching breath/no cyanosis (P-32), and 'looks fine otherwise' (P-9). Also minor error calling mother 'patient'. Significant discrepancies on earliest symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: wheezy (P-1,P-2), short of breath/SOB (P-1,P-2,P-3), cough (P-1), out of breath with activity (P-3). Partially covers earliest via P-1/P-2 but misses explicit pairing in P-2 and that cough is later. Missed: hard time catching breath/no cyanosis (P-32), cough non-productive (P-31), looks fine (P-9). Covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-1 wheezy/cough/SOB; P-2 wheezy/diff deep breaths; P-3 out of breath). No fabrications or hallucinations; interpretation of earliest as wheezy is grounded in P-1/P-2 text, though selective.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists symptoms at presentation with citations and explicitly answers which was earliest, perfectly matching the two-part question with no off-topic content."
