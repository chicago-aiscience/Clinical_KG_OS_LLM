  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript, including diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick to lab, blood work), prophylactic antibiotics with reasons (timeframe >72 hours, geographic risk), physician consultation plans, and preventive advice on insecticide and tick habitats. Minor paraphrasing (e.g., 'instructed to inspect' vs. 'take a look') is faithful, and no contradictions or errors exist.",
    "completeness": "Covered: All three diagnostic tests with citations; prophylactic antibiotics with key reasons and citations; physician consultation with accurate summary and citations; preventive advice on insecticide and habitats (long grass, woods-fields intersection). Missed: Specific description of ticks 'making a waving motion with their legs' in preventive advice; minor details like exact quotes on attachment time/geography in treatment section. Covers ~95% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the cited transcript sections (e.g., D-18 for physical exam, blood work, preventive advice; D-6 for tick lab and antibiotics). No hallucinated facts; paraphrases (e.g., 'surveillance' from 'take a look') are grounded and accurate. Citations match content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured perfectly around the question's components (diagnostic tests split lab/physical, treatments, consultation, preventive advice on garden/outdoor), with no off-topic content or tangents."
