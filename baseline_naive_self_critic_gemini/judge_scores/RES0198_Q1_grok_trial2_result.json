  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer partially captures nasal symptoms (stuffy and runny nose from P-1) but omits duration (1 week, P-2), evolution (stuffy first, now mostly running, P-3), and incorrectly describes discharge character as 'runny' (P-1) and attributes 'congestion and drainage' to doctor (D-6) instead of patient's report of 'mostly clear' (P-5, as in Gold). For denials, it lists some correct ones (cough P-4, sore throat P-7, loss of taste/smell P-16) but falsely claims patient did not explicitly say 'no' (contradicts explicit 'No' in P-4, P-7, etc.), misses post-nasal drip denial (P-6), and adds extras like headaches (P-14) not central to question examples. Significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: stuffy/runny nose (partial). Missed: 1-week duration, stuffy first/now running, clear discharge, post-nasal drip denial (P-6), fatigue (P-15); partial on some denials (cough, sore throat, anosmia). Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: stuffy/runny [P-1]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: discharge as 'runny' only (ignores P-5 clear), doctor identification of discharge (D-6 misattributed), no explicit 'no' from patient (falsely contradicts P-4 'No', P-7 'No', P-16 'No'), infers absence from doctor questions rather than patient responses. Mentions non-existent 'knowledge graph'. Multiple hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around question parts (nasal symptoms, discharge character, denied symptoms) with bullet points matching examples; minor extras like headaches but focused on query."
