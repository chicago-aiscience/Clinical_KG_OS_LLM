{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the child sometimes takes OTC Reactine/other OTC allergy medications for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications in her management (consistent with [P-36], [P-46], [P-47]). However, it introduces an unverifiable element (“Knowledge Graph explicitly links…”) that is not present in the transcript, and it loosely attributes statements to “the patient” rather than the parent (minor). No major contradictions with the Gold Answer, but the “Knowledge Graph” claim reduces factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) intermittent OTC Reactine/OTC allergy meds; (2) no prescribed medications. Key points missed: (1) for the current wheezing/SOB episodes, the mother gives her nothing and episodes resolve on their own/with rest ([P-33], [P-34]); (2) confirmation of “no regular medications” aside from occasional Reactine ([P-47]); (3) prior viral infections did not require antibiotics ([P-16]). Overall, it captures some but not all clinically relevant medication/treatment details asked in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (Reactine/OTC use, no prescribed meds). The references to a “Knowledge Graph” and “clinical documentation” are not supported by the provided transcript and represent minor hallucinated context, though they do not add new clinical facts beyond what is stated.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments and whether prescribed medication was part of management, which directly answers the question. It does not add significant irrelevant material."
