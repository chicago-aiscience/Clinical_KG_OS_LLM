  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly classifies the loss of taste as a 'complete loss' (ageusia). The transcript and Gold Answer clarify in P-4 that the patient could still taste 'really, really salty foods,' making it a partial loss. It correctly identifies the smell loss as partial and the cough as mild.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include the specific details explicitly requested by the prompt regarding what the patient could and could not perceive (e.g., being able to smell 'really bad' things, being able to taste salty food, but being unable to taste a banana). It also omits the duration (two days) and the non-productive nature of the cough.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer relies on P-1 for its claims. While P-1 uses the phrase 'lost my sense of taste,' the answer ignores the crucial clarification in P-4 where the patient defines the limits of that loss. Labeling it 'complete' is an inaccurate interpretation of the full transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant as it attempts to categorize the symptoms and their degrees as requested, though it fails to provide the requested qualitative details."
