  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the activities (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), the location of the tick (behind the knee), and the comparison to the prior episode (10 years ago, target rash, antibiotics, engorgement differences).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points. It misses the specific geographic location (Strathroy) mentioned in the Gold Answer and the doctor's specific estimation that the tick had been attached for 'at least 72 hours.' However, it captures the essential timeline and all comparative symptoms between the current and prior bites.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is perfectly grounded in the transcript. It uses appropriate speaker tags (e.g., [P-1]) and does not introduce any information not present in the text.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, directly addressing both the timeline of exposure and the comparison of symptoms/engorgement as requested in the prompt."
