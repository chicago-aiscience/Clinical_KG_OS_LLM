  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the cough duration (4-5 days), its non-productive/dry nature, lack of improvement (paraphrasing 'stayed the same'), runny nose duration (couple of days), and clear nasal discharge, matching Gold; minor issues include referencing a non-existent knowledge graph for classification and association, and phrasing cough persistence slightly differently from Gold's 'stayed the same'; includes correct sore throat denial as pertinent negative; core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: cough 4-5 days [yes], dry/non-productive [yes], stayed same/not improving [partial via P-2], runny nose couple days & clear [yes]; missed: explicit 'no gunk' detail, patient history of never having such dry cough or prolonged runny nose before, pertinent negatives like no chest pain, no SOB/wheezing; adds sore throat denial [in Gold]; covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like cough duration [P-2], runny nose [P-11/P-12], sore throat denial [P-9] verifiable; dry/non-productive grounded in [D-5/P-5/D-6/P-6] but attributed to hallucinated 'knowledge graph'; multiple references to non-existent knowledge graph with fabricated [SYMPTOM] notations are hallucinations; association of runny nose to cough invented; some unverifiable but mostly grounded otherwise.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists reported respiratory symptoms (cough, runny nose) with characteristics (duration, dry/non-productive, clear discharge) as asked; sore throat denial is minor tangent (not reported symptom); knowledge graph irrelevant noise but overall focused on question."
