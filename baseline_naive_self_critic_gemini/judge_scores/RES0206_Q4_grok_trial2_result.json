  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID) and the test (COVID swab) with accurate citations from [D-43], matching the Gold Answer. However, it makes a significant factual error by claiming 'the provided transcript does not contain any specific information regarding the patient's recent social contacts or exposure history,' directly contradicting the transcript ([P-20], [D-21], [P-21]) and Gold Answer, which details the sick friend during dog walks as the prompting factor. This is a major contradiction on a core element of the question.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Condition: COVID-19 [D-43]; (2) Test: COVID swab [D-43]; (3) Prompting detail: sick friend during outdoor dog walks, walking too close, unsure of friend's COVID test [P-20, P-21]; additional screening for symptoms/travel. Generated covers (1) and (2) fully but completely misses (3), stating no such info exists; covers ~33% of core points (2 out of 3 main), none of the details.",
    "faithfulness": "Condition and test claims are verifiable in [D-43]. However, the claim of no information on social contacts/exposure is not grounded and contradicts explicit transcript evidence in [P-20] (patient describes meeting sick friend for dog walks, walking too close) and [D-21/P-21] (doctor asks about friend's COVID test). This fabricates an absence of facts present in the transcript, equivalent to hallucination by denial.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around the three-part question (condition, test, social contacts detail), with numbered responses matching the query exactly; no off-topic content or tangents, fully focused despite the error in content."
