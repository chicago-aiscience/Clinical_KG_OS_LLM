  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately states that testing was negative, consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript (patient: “I have had the covid test and I don't have it” [P-35]). The stated prompting factors (hospital worker status and persistent cough after initial flu-like symptoms) align with the Gold Answer. A minor issue is the added inference that the patient feared spreading infection; the transcript more specifically notes coworkers being “scared at work when I cough” [P-35] rather than an explicit statement of fear of spreading infection.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) COVID-19 investigated, (2) hospital worker/occupational exposure context, (3) viral/flu-like initial symptoms with persistent cough, (4) negative result. Key points missed: (a) the timing of the test (performed ~2 weeks ago at symptom onset [P-36]), and (b) that the patient stayed home awaiting symptom resolution before returning to work [P-36]. Also does not explicitly mention coworkers being scared as a prompt (though it paraphrases the workplace concern). Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript: persistent cough duration and symptom course [P-2, P-14], hospital work and PPE [P-17, P-34], negative COVID test [P-35]. The statement about 'conducted a differential diagnosis' is interpretive but based on questions asked. The 'fearing they might spread an infection' element is not directly stated and is slightly speculative. Thus, largely faithful with minor inference.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question: diagnosis investigated (COVID-19), what prompted it (hospital exposure risk + flu-like symptoms + persistent cough), and what testing showed (negative). No major irrelevant tangents."
