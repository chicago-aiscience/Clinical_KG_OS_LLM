{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript and Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab test, the 48-hour turnaround, and the isolation instructions.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a few specific details present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to explicitly state that the patient also identified COVID-19 as a concern (the question asked what condition 'both' identified), although it mentions the doctor's identification. It also omits the instruction regarding 'further instructions from public health' and the specific instruction to 'not see anyone else' beyond home isolation.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript [P-1, D-39]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the multi-part question without including irrelevant information."
