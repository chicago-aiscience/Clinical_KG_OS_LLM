  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately captures quality as uncomfortable/odd initially and sharp/strong on deep breath; duration of episodes as 20 minutes intermittent; occurrence when alone studying/walking, at rest; resolves when social/distracted; denies worse with exercise, no injury/prior. Generated Answer matches quality (minor citation error, sharp in P-3 not P-2), duration of episodes and overall, occurrence situations partially, but significantly errs on resolution by claiming it does not resolve without intervention (contradicts transcript where it resolves after 20 min when distracted/social, P-9/P-29) and falsely correlates with anxiety attacks via P-20 (which is about palpitations, not pain). Significant contradictions on key resolution aspect.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: quality (uncomfortable/odd/sharp deep breath), duration episodes (20 min), overall duration (1.5 weeks), occurrence (studying/walking alone). Missed/poorly covered: resolves when engaged socially/talking/hands-on (P-9/P-29), occurs at rest (D-11/P-11), denies worsening with exercise/walking same (P-10), no injury (P-5), no prior episodes (P-17). Covers occurrence situations but misses resolution contrast and other details; approximately 50-70% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: quality P-2 (partial), duration P-2/P-6 accurate, frequency D-18 verifiable, occurrence P-4 accurate. Issues: sharp quality cited wrong (P-2 vs P-3); resolution 'does not resolve without intervention' not in transcript (it does after 20 min); meds no help P-6 ok but not resolution; 'correlates with anxiety attack' P-20 hallucinated (P-20 about heart flutter, not pain). Multiple misinterpretations/hallucinations on resolution.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around quality, duration of episodes, occurrence/resolution situations as per question; adds relevant frequency/exercise notes but minor tangents like anxiety/meds; highly focused on query."
