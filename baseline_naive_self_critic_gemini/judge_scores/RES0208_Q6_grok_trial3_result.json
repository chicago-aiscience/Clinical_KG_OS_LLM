{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that no diagnostic tests like chest X-ray or COVID swab were ordered, despite explicit mention in [D-37]; it denies self-isolation instructions given by the doctor in [D-37]; it claims no timeline for results, contradicting the 24-48 hours stated in [D-37]; and misrepresents criteria, which Gold Answer accurately notes as based on results. These are significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: physical exam (chest focus), chest X-ray, COVID swab, self-isolation (stay away from everyone including wife, from doctor), 24-48 hour timeline with public health nurse follow-up, disposition based on results. Generated covers only physical exam partially (misses chest focus), misses all diagnostic tests, self-isolation, timeline, and full criteria details. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims 'transcript does not explicitly state' diagnostic tests, but [D-37] explicitly orders chest X-ray and COVID swab; denies self-isolation instructions present in [D-37]; no timeline despite [D-37]; criteria linked to results in [D-37]. Citations like [D-38] accurate but incomplete; multiple hallucinated absences contradict transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the question's elements (diagnostic tests, physical exam, self-isolation, timeline, criteria), with no off-topic content, perfectly mirroring the query's focus despite inaccuracies."
