  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the plan stated in [D-43]: physical exam with vitals and chest auscultation, COVID swab, unspecified additional labs, discussion with the attending, and using vitals/labs to decide admission vs discharge. It also correctly notes the clinician’s impression of a COPD exacerbation likely triggered by infection. No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) physical exam with vitals and listening to chest, (2) COVID swab and other unspecified labs, (3) impression of COPD exacerbation likely due to infection, (4) disposition criteria based on vitals and labs, (5) plan to consult attending. Minor items not included: explicit mention of checking temperature (though implicitly part of vitals), the plan to come back and discuss the decision with the patient, and the patient’s agreement with the plan.",
    "faithfulness": "All included elements are grounded in [D-43]. The answer does not introduce specific tests/labs beyond what is stated (it correctly keeps labs non-specific) and does not add ungrounded criteria for admission/discharge beyond labs and vital signs.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by summarizing the end-of-consultation plan, including examinations, tests, consultation, and the criteria for ER admission vs discharge, with no meaningful tangents."
