  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer correctly identifies the main symptom clusters of (1) dry, near-nonstop daytime cough, (2) shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, and (3) wheezing. However, it contains two important factual errors central to the question: (a) it states the patient did not explicitly confirm chest tightness, but the patient did confirm it (“Yes” to chest tightness, P-20); and (b) it states the patient did not provide a specific nighttime frequency, but the patient did (“every other day… every two days or so,” P-18). These errors affect key asked-for elements (chest sensations and day vs night frequency).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: dry cough and daytime near-constant nature; shortness of breath/hard time breathing; wheezing; general statement that nighttime symptoms are less frequent than daytime.\nKey Gold Answer elements missed or misstated: cough duration (~two weeks); explicit non-productive nature as contrasted with “bringing up gunk”; wheezing occurring more frequently than bronchodilator use; chest tightness (explicitly confirmed); and the specific nighttime frequency (every other day/every two days). Overall, it captures some but not most of the required detailed qualifiers.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded in the transcript (e.g., dry cough almost nonstop during the day; shortness of breath; wheezing a lot; nighttime less than daytime). But it directly contradicts the transcript regarding chest tightness (P-20) and nighttime frequency (P-18), which are not just unverifiable but explicitly stated. The added framing about “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript (though it is mainly meta-language).",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the requested symptom descriptions (cough character, breathing difficulty, wheeze, day/night frequency). It includes minor extra detail about triggers (cold air/pollen) that is not asked for but still asthma-related, so it is only a small tangent."
