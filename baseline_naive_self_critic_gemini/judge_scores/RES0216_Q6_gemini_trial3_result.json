  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the doctor's assessment and plan as described in the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the primary differential (asthma), the specific physical exam component (listening to the lungs), the initial treatment (rescue puffers), and the contingency plan (revisiting the assessment). It also captures the doctor's reasoning for de-prioritizing cardiac issues based on the patient's description of symptoms in D-36.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points from the gold answer. It correctly addresses the assessment, the physical exam, the first-step intervention, and the contingency approach. However, it misses the detail mentioned in the gold answer regarding the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician ('the doc') before finalizing next steps, as noted in D-35 and D-37.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the provided transcript. The citations [D-35], [D-36], and [P-1] are used correctly to support the points made about the assessment and clinical plan.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the user's multi-part question without including extraneous information."
