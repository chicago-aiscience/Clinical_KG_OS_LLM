  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that the transcript does not mention diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, or timelines, all of which are clearly provided in the doctor's statement in [D-37]. Specifically, it misses the chest X-ray, COVID swab, and the 24-48 hour timeline.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the chest X-ray, COVID swab, the specific instruction to stay away from the wife, the timeline, and the role of the public health nurse. It only correctly identifies the physical examination.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer demonstrates poor faithfulness by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is present. This constitutes a significant negative hallucination, as it misrepresents the source text's contents.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only marginally relevant. While it uses the categories requested in the question as headings, it fails to populate them with the relevant information found in the transcript, instead providing incorrect 'not mentioned' statements."
