  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It claims the patient has not mentioned any previously prescribed medications, which contradicts transcript [P-23] where she mentions her family doctor previously prescribed a cream for her eczema. It also states she is not taking any 'treatments,' ignoring the mention of moisturizing creams for her eczema [P-23].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific mention of previously prescribed eczema cream from Shoppers Drug Mart, the current use of moisturizing creams, the denial of drug allergies, and the details regarding contraception (condoms).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails to accurately reflect the transcript contents. It claims the patient did not report previous medications, which is a hallucination of the absence of information that is actually present in the text [P-23].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question asked, although the information provided is inaccurate and incomplete."
