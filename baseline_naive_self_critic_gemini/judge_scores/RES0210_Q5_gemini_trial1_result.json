  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by claiming the transcript does not contain information about the patient's occupational role. This information is explicitly present in transcript segments [P-33] and [P-34]. Additionally, it misses the detail that the patient started smoking at age 15 [P-38], which was explicitly asked for in the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It completely misses the occupational elicitation (engineering side, safety measures, Sarnia location). 2) It misses the starting age of smoking (15). 3) It omits the critical mention of hemoptysis (red spots in sputum) which is vital for the 'collective relation' to malignancy.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a 'negative hallucination' by asserting that information clearly present in the source transcript (the occupational role as an engineering consultant) does not exist. This is a failure to ground the response in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in its structure, addressing the categories requested, but it is undermined by the omission of one of the three primary risk factors it was asked to discuss."
