  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript lacks historical context for diagnosis at age eight (directly in P-2) and baseline bronchodilator use once every two weeks (P-8), contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate summary of these facts. It also misattributes citations (e.g., wheezing to P-18 instead of P-15; chest tightness to D-20 instead of P-20) and vaguely notes an increase without quantifying baseline or current frequency (5-6 times/week from P-8). Core evolution is misrepresented as unknowable. Significant errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: diagnosis age 8/now 10; baseline infrequent use (once/2wks), triggers (exercise/cold/seasonal); current 2wk exacerbation (cough nonstop, wheezing increased, SOB/chest tight, bronchodilator 5-6x/wk, wheezing > use, nighttime sx, no precipitant). Generated covers current symptoms (cough/SOB/wheezing/chest tight partially), triggers, vague increase/no nighttime specificity, but misses diagnosis age, baseline details, evolution timeline, wheezing frequency vs use. Covers ~30-40% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims unverifiable: no historical context (falsely, see P-2/P-8); references 'knowledge graph' absent from transcript; wrong citations (P-18 for wheezing, D-20 for chest tightness). Some claims grounded (current symptoms in P-1/P-15/P-19/P-20, triggers P-9/P-11), but multiple inaccuracies and hallucinations about data availability.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on temporal evolution (dx -> baseline -> current exacerbation). Generated denies ability to address evolution/baseline (despite evidence), then details only current symptoms/triggers, partially addressing 'current' phase but ignoring progression and baseline comparison."
