  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by stating that the specific questions about fever, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, rashes, and phlegm were not in the transcript. These questions are clearly present (D-7, D-8, D-10, D-11, D-13, D-31). Consequently, it fails to provide the mapping between these symptoms and the conditions the doctor was screening for (e.g., pneumonia, URTI, contagious etiologies) as described in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the entire first part of the question which requires explaining the clinical rationale for the specific symptoms listed. It identifies the conditions (Acute Respiratory Infection vs. Asthma) but does not utilize the requested evidence from the transcript. It covers 0% of the mapping points provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a significant failure in grounding by claiming that information is missing when it is explicitly available in the source transcript. This is a negative hallucination that fundamentally undermines the quality of the response.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it discusses the differential diagnosis for the patient, it explicitly refuses to address the specific symptoms requested in the prompt, claiming they are unavailable. It pivots to other evidence (cold weather, allergies) rather than answering the question as framed. It only addresses the goal of narrowing the diagnosis but ignores the specified constraints."
