  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that there were no explicit concluding remarks or stated management plan and claims the dialogue ends earlier with anxiety discussion, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [D-33] which clearly states the plan to pass information to another doctor; it also inaccurately describes symptoms (e.g., adds unmentioned 'nausea-like symptoms') and omits or misrepresents key details like episode duration, specific triggers/relievers, and many pertinent negatives, leading to significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers the explicit plan (relay to another doctor) and categorizes key info into symptoms (duration, characteristics, triggers), failed OTCs (specific meds), pertinent negatives (trauma, fevers, asthma, etc.), history (anxiety, smoking, family), psychosocial (stress, living alone, meds); Generated covers partial symptoms (pain with deep breath, anxiety SOB), stress/thesis, anxiety history, family/smoking, but misses the entire plan, specific duration (1.5 weeks), 20-min episodes, distraction relief, exact OTCs, most negatives (e.g., no trauma/fever/asthma/no palpitations/no family sudden death), multivitamin, living alone details—covers roughly 30-40% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are mostly grounded in transcript with citations (e.g., [P-19], [P-15]), but hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph (KG)' references throughout (not in transcript), 'nausea-like symptoms' (absent), and wrongly asserts no concluding remarks despite [D-33]; multiple unverifiable additions reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "Addresses key clinical information gathered but completely misses/denies the stated plan from concluding remarks, introduces irrelevant KG context and differential diagnosis speculation; partially on-topic but with significant gaps and tangents."
