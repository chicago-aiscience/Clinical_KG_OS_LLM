  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer falsely claims that no complete plan for diagnostic testing, consultation, or follow-up was communicated, directly contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate summary of the plan from [D-1] (chat, exam, consult supervising doctor, return with next steps), [D-37] (chest X-ray), [D-39] (COVID swab), and [D-40] (arrange tests and return to discuss). It ignores these explicit statements and instead summarizes patient history, introducing factual errors about the transcript's content.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: structured visit plan including exam and consultation [D-1]; chest X-ray proposed [D-37]; COVID-19 swab as standard [D-39]; age-appropriate explanations [D-38,D-39]; trainee consulting supervising doctor [D-37]; arrange tests and return with supervising doctor for next steps [D-40]; family acknowledgment [P-40]. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, providing unrelated patient history summary instead.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript 'concludes with the patient's history and review of systems' without a plan, but the plan is clearly communicated in [D-1], [D-37], [D-39], [D-40]. Its citations ([P-2], [P-11], etc.) verify history details but are irrelevant to the plan; no claims about the plan are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks for the doctor's communicated plan, tests, consultation, and follow-up; Generated Answer denies the plan exists, labels it absent, and diverts to an off-topic clinical summary of patient presentation and history."
