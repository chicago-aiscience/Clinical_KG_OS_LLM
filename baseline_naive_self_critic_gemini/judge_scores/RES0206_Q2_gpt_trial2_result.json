  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely incorrect relative to the Gold Answer. It states that inhaler frequency is “not documented,” but the transcript clearly specifies two inhalers: one used every day and a rescue inhaler used about once every two weeks [P-26]. It also claims hypertension and the reason for no antihypertensive medication are not mentioned, but the transcript explicitly includes a diagnosis of high blood pressure [P-22] and that she is not on medication because she chose lifestyle modification first after discussing it with her doctor [P-23], with weight loss and increased walking [P-24].",
    "completeness": "It misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) two-inhaler regimen (maintenance daily + rescue PRN), (2) rescue inhaler frequency (once every ~2 weeks), (3) no home oxygen [P-1], (4) hypertension diagnosis [P-22], (5) not on antihypertensives due to lifestyle-first decision after discussion [P-23], (6) lifestyle measures (weight loss, increased walking) [P-24]. It only captures that she uses puffers and COPD is usually manageable.",
    "faithfulness": "While it does not invent medication names, it makes multiple claims that information is absent when it is present in the transcript (inhaler frequency, hypertension history, and rationale for no antihypertensive therapy). This is not grounded in the provided transcript and reflects significant misreading/omission of available evidence.",
    "relevance": "The response is broadly aimed at COPD/hypertension management, but it fails to answer the asked specifics (inhaler frequencies and reason for no antihypertensive medication). It remains on-topic but is not responsive enough to the question."
