  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript and Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the grandparents' asthma, the lack of shortness of breath/wheezing, and the current symptoms (cough, runny nose). It attributes the differentiation to the patient rather than specifically the mother (who actually provided the history in P-28), but this is a minor distinction given the 'P' label in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two significant points present in the Gold Answer and transcript: 1) The mother specifically stated the child had been 'worked up' for asthma previously with negative results, which is strong evidence for differentiation. 2) The patient's own comparison of this cough to previous illnesses (which were shorter and didn't involve this type of dry cough) was omitted.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The claims regarding the absence of wheezing/SOB (P-28), current symptoms (P-2, P-11), and negative symptoms (P-9, P-13, P-16) are all verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and exclusively addresses the two parts of the user's question: the connection to the doctor's inquiry and the evidence used for differentiation."
