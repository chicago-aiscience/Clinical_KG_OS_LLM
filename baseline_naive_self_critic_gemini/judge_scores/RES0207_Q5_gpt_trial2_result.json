  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main contributors highlighted in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence as a precipitating factor for the seizure (patient forgot their medication and thought that was the cause [P-9]) and (2) hereditary predisposition via a direct maternal history of epilepsy (\"My mom had it\" [P-26]). It also correctly links the family history to the patient’s underlying epilepsy diagnosis mentioned by the patient [P-8]. No direct contradictions with the Gold Answer are present. The only slight issue is wording that family history \"confirms\" the diagnosis; it more accurately supports genetic predisposition rather than confirming diagnosis, but this is minor.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: hereditary risk (epilepsy runs in family; mother affected), medication-related risk (missed anti-epileptic dose), and connection of family history to underlying epilepsy.\nKey Gold Answer points missed or less specific: the specific medication name (Keppra [P-23]); the reason for missing the dose (daughter’s birthday disrupted routine/dinner-time dose [P-24]); and that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent [P-9]. Overall coverage is strong but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly grounded in the transcript (missed medication [P-9]; maternal epilepsy [P-26]; patient has epilepsy [P-8]). However, the statement \"According to the knowledge graph...\" introduces an external source not present in the transcript, and the risk-factor framing attributed to the knowledge graph is not explicitly stated in the encounter. This is a minor ungrounded addition rather than a major hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on hereditary and medication-related risk factors for the seizure and explicitly explains how family history relates to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis. No meaningful tangents."
