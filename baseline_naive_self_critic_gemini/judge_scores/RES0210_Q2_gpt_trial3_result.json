  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the two medications mentioned in the transcript: Lipitor (prescription) and Tylenol (OTC), and it correctly reports the patient’s assessment that Tylenol “helps a little bit.” However, it inaccurately states Tylenol was used \"to treat a cough\"—the transcript supports Tylenol being used for feeling feverish/unwell rather than as a cough treatment. It also cites [P-1] as evidence for Tylenol use, but Tylenol is only mentioned at [P-14].",
    "completeness": "Covers the key medications (Lipitor and Tylenol) and includes an effectiveness statement for the OTC medication. It omits that Lipitor was confirmed as the only prescription medication ([P-27]) and does not include the gold answer’s note that no other meds were mentioned. It also does not mention the non-medication measure (expectorating sputum) that provided temporary relief, though that is ancillary to the medication-focused question.",
    "faithfulness": "Partially grounded: Lipitor for cholesterol is directly supported by [P-25–P-27], and Tylenol helping “a little bit” is supported by [P-14]. But the claim that Tylenol was used to treat the cough is not stated in the transcript (it’s an inference and likely incorrect given context), and the reference to a “provided knowledge graph” is unsupported by the source transcript. The citation to [P-1] for Tylenol is also not faithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing prescribed and OTC medications, their uses, and OTC effectiveness, with no major irrelevant tangents."
