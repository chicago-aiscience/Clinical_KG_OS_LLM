  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures baseline manageability with puffers [P-1] and acute worsening symptoms over 3 days [P-1] including increased cough, sputum change, hemoptysis, and dyspnea, matching Gold. It correctly notes prior ED visits without admission [P-5]. Minor discrepancies: omits explicit progression ('getting a little worse' [P-2]), baseline details (lifestyle [P-28], inhaler frequency [P-26], dog walks [P-4]), fever [P-9], and direct 'worst ever' statement [P-3]; adds sinus pressure [P-12] and doctor's suspicion [D-43] not emphasized in Gold as core facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: baseline puffers [P-1] (partial), 3-day symptoms (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea [P-1]); prior ED visits no admit [P-5,P-6]. Missed: full baseline (lifestyle [P-28], inhaler use [P-26], activities [P-4]), exercise tolerance specifics [P-4], fever [P-9], explicit worsening over period [P-2], 'worst that I've had' [P-3], prior worsening by illness [P-3]. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: baseline/symptoms [P-1], sinus [P-12], ED history [P-5], doctor's assessment [D-43]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom evolution from baseline to acute presentation over 3 days and prior history; implies worsening but lacks explicit [P-2] statement; partial severity comparison (ED visits but misses 'worst'); minor tangent on doctor's suspicion/management plan [D-43] not central to question."
