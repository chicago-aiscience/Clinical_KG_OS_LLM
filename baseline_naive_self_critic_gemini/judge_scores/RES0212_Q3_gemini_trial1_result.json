  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis (bacterial respiratory infection/bronchitis/pneumonia). However, it overstates the clinical specificity of greenish sputum, whereas the Gold Answer correctly notes it is not definitive for bacterial infection. Most importantly, the Generated Answer fails to cite the patient's actual statement confirming nighttime heat [P-4] as evidence for fever, instead relying on the doctor's questions [D-4, D-5] and general medical theory.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it does not mention the chronic/intermittent three-month cough that preceded the acute worsening, it fails to include the doctor's summary in [D-47] as a synthesizing element, and it omits the crucial evidence from [P-4] regarding the patient's subjective fever.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer suffers from significant faithfulness issues. It references a '[Knowledge Graph]' which does not exist in the source transcript. It also implies that night sweats are part of the clinical picture or systemic response for this patient, despite the patient explicitly denying night sweats in [P-5]. Furthermore, it fails to use the actual evidence for fever provided in [P-4].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant to the question, structuring its response around the three clinical features requested and providing a diagnosis, though it includes some irrelevant external reasoning (the Knowledge Graph)."
