  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) and the family history. However, it introduces information from a 'knowledge graph' (KG) that is not present in the source transcript, which constitutes a factual addition not supported by the provided materials. The Gold Answer focuses purely on what was said in the transcript and how the clinician responded. The Generated Answer's attempt to distinguish between asthma triggers and allergy triggers using external knowledge deviates from the transcript-based evaluation.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three triggers and family history, which are key points in the Gold Answer. However, it misses important details: (1) the specific escalation in rescue inhaler use from once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week, (2) the clinician's specific response 'that would make sense' regarding allergies, (3) the denial of other allergies when asked, (4) the clinician's suggestion about medication changes to better control asthma. These omissions represent approximately 30-40% of the key information in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer introduces external 'knowledge graph' references [KG] that do not exist in the transcript. This represents hallucinated citations. While the core claims about triggers and family history are verifiable in the transcript, the framework used to analyze them (distinguishing asthma vs. allergy triggers via knowledge graph) is not grounded in the source material. The transcript shows the doctor asking about allergies in response to pollen mention, but doesn't provide the categorical distinctions the Generated Answer claims.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about how triggers and family history relate to the current exacerbation and allergy suspicion. It stays on topic throughout and provides a structured response. However, it could be more focused on the relationship aspects specifically requested rather than listing symptoms and triggers separately."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer identifies correct triggers and family history but introduces non-existent 'knowledge graph' citations, constituting hallucination. It misses key details about medication use escalation (once/2 weeks to 5-6 times/week) and the clinician's specific responses. While relevant to the question, the external framework imposed on the analysis reduces both correctness and faithfulness to the source transcript."
