  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the two medications mentioned: Lipitor and Tylenol. It correctly identifies the condition for Lipitor (cholesterol). For Tylenol, it attributes its use to the cough mentioned in P-1, whereas the Gold Answer more accurately attributes it to general symptom relief/fever mentioned in P-8/P-14. Additionally, the generated answer includes the transcript's likely typographical error ('I haven't taken some Tylenol') but correctly interprets that the patient meant they had taken it.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer addresses all parts of the specific question: current medications, conditions, and effectiveness. It does not include the extra contextual information found in the Gold Answer (clearing gunk, allergies, cannabis use), but since those were not explicitly requested by the question, the response is considered complete.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It uses direct quotes and correctly cites the paragraphs (P-1, P-14, P-25, P-26).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question without including the unnecessary background details present in the Gold Answer."
