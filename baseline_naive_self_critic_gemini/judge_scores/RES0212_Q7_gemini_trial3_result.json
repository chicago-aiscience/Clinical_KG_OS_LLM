{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the initial onset (three months ago) and the onset of sleep disruption (one month ago). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding subjective fevers. It states the patient did not mention fever, whereas the transcript at [P-4] shows the patient reporting feeling 'hot at night in the past couple days,' which constitutes a subjective fever.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers three of the four specific timeline points requested (onset, sleep disruption, and productivity). It fails to provide the timeline for the subjective fevers (requested in the prompt) because it incorrectly claims they were not mentioned. It also uses the vague 'past few days' for the productive cough instead of the specific 'three days' mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript regarding the fevers. At [P-4], the patient explicitly mentions feeling hot at night. The Generated Answer's claim that she 'does not mention fever' is a hallucination of a negative fact that contradicts the source.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, following the specific timeline points requested by the user, although the content of the final point is inaccurate."
