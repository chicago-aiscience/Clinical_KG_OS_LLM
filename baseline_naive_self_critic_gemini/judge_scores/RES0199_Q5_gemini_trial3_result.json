  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It claims the doctor did not systematically explore infection sources, whereas the transcript shows the doctor explicitly asking about living situation (D-45), environmental triggers (D-46), sick contacts (D-47), workplace (D-48, D-50), and travel (D-49).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses 100% of the key points in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the apartment, the car dealership, the lack of travel, or the environmental screening.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucination of absence. It claims there is no evidence in the provided text for questions that are clearly present in the transcript (specifically segments D-45 through D-50).",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the specific question asked, it provides a false negative response that ignores the content of the transcript."
