  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as a bacterial respiratory infection (bronchitis or pneumonia). However, it incorrectly includes 'night sweats' in the final summary clinical triad, despite the patient explicitly denying them in [P-5]. It also fails to mention the patient's specific confirmation of feeling 'hot at night' [P-4], instead focusing on the doctor's questions [D-4, D-5] and the patient's fatigue [P-19] as the evidence for fever.",
    "completeness": "The answer addresses all three requested features (productive cough, sputum color, and fevers). It misses the Gold Answer's nuanced point about the acute infection being superimposed on a chronic three-month cough, although it does mention the three-month duration in the cough section. It also omits the 'absence of other constitutional symptoms' mentioned in the Gold Answer as a distinguishing factor.",
    "faithfulness": "There is a clear hallucination regarding a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the source text or prompt. Additionally, the answer misrepresents the transcript by suggesting night sweats are part of the clinical picture when the patient denied them. It also cites [P-19] for fevers, whereas [P-19] is actually about fatigue and sleep disturbance.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the question's request to link the three clinical features to a diagnosis."
