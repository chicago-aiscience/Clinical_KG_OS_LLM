  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Claritin for seasonal allergies (carried but not actively taken) and allergy shots from the allergist in some years, matching Gold. However, it fails to specify 'Deyo' as the birth control name, omits its description as a three-month oral contraceptive pill (not IUD), incorrectly states no dosing details were mentioned (ignoring 'goes for three months' and shots 'once a week for a little while in winter'), and misses no medication allergies, no EpiPen, and allergy specifics (seasonal, no swelling/breathing issues). These are significant omissions of specific names, indications, and dosing as required, but core medications/treatments are not contradicted. Score: 3.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: Claritin details (full), birth control existence (partial), allergy shots existence/some years (partial). Missed: 'Deyo' specific name, birth control as three-month oral pill (not IUD), shots dosing/timing (once/week winter), no med allergies, no EpiPen, seasonal allergies without severe symptoms. Covers ~50-60% of key points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims (Claritin use/carrying, birth control taking, allergy shots) are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-16, P-25]. No fabrications or hallucinations. The claim of 'no specific dosing details' is inaccurate (transcript has details for both birth control and shots) but stems from under-reading rather than invention; overall mostly grounded. Score: 4.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address current medications/carrying and past allergist treatments, includes indications where mentioned, and stays focused on the question without off-topic content. Score: 5."
