  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding systemic symptoms. It claims the patient 'reported' joint pain, whereas the transcript [P-7] and Gold Answer explicitly state she denied it. The patient specifically clarified that the soreness was in the skin, not the joint [P-1].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key local details mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the tick being 'stuck pretty good' and the explicit denial of a bullseye/target rash. While it identifies the denial of fever and headaches, it fails to correctly identify joint pain as a denied symptom.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the patient reported joint pain is unfaithful to the transcript. The patient explicitly says 'No' when asked about joint pain [P-7] and distinguishes her skin soreness from joint pain [P-1].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, although it providing incorrect information for one of the systemic symptoms."
