  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain the clinician's plan, the COVID-19 test, or the consultation steps. However, the provided transcript clearly includes the COVID swab (D-29), the plan to consult the doctor (D-29, D-43), and the suggestion of changing medications (D-43). The Generated Answer's claim that the transcript ends at [P-32] is factually wrong as the source text goes to [P-44].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to provide any of the specific information requested in the prompt (COVID test, medication change, consultation), claiming the information is missing. It covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer regarding the clinician's plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a limitation that does not exist. It claims the text ends prematurely and that the information is absent, which is directly contradicted by the provided source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question. Instead of providing the clinician's plan, it provides a summary of symptoms and then claims it cannot answer the primary query."
