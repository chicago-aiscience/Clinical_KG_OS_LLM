  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes that the grandson visited, attends daycare, had a cold [P-23], and that the doctor assessed “some sort of an infection” and could not rule out COVID [D-36]. However, it contains a major factual error by claiming the doctor did not explore other exposure pathways (travel or in-person client visits). In the transcript, the doctor explicitly asked about travel outside the province [D-24] and about recent in-person client visits [D-32], which the patient denied/dated to “a couple weeks” ago [P-24, P-32]. It also introduces an unsupported claim about a “Knowledge Graph” identifying the grandson’s cold as a COVID-19 risk factor—this is not in the transcript or Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) grandson daycare + cold exposure as plausible source; (2) doctor suspected infection and couldn’t rule out COVID. Key points missed/incorrect: (1) doctor asked and patient denied travel outside the province; (2) occupational exposure explored (financial advisor, mostly WFH, last in-person visit a couple weeks ago), making work exposure less likely; (3) with these excluded, grandson exposure remained most identifiable source. Overall, it omits or contradicts a substantial portion of the Gold Answer’s exposure-history content.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “Knowledge Graph” and its risk-factor assertion are hallucinated. Additionally, the claim that the doctor did not ask about travel or client visits directly contradicts the transcript [D-24, D-32]. While some exposure details are faithful (grandson/daycare/cold; doctor can’t rule out COVID), the presence of clear hallucination and contradiction significantly reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic (it addresses the grandson exposure and other possible exposure pathways). However, it becomes less useful by incorrectly asserting that travel and in-person visits were not explored, and by adding irrelevant “Knowledge Graph” content. Still, it largely attempts to answer the asked question rather than going off-topic."
