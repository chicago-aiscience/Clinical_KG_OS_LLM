  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer on most key points: it correctly identifies the dry cough, breathing difficulties, and wheezing. It accurately captures the daytime vs nighttime frequency difference, noting that nighttime symptoms 'don't happen as much as my daytime symptoms.' However, it contains one significant error: it states 'the patient did not explicitly confirm this sensation' regarding chest tightness, when in fact P-20 clearly confirms 'Yes' to chest tightness. This is a factual error contradicting both the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: dry cough character, breathing difficulties, wheezing, and daytime/nighttime frequency differences. However, it makes a critical omission by claiming chest tightness was NOT confirmed, when the Gold Answer explicitly states it was confirmed (D-20, P-20). It also omits the specific nighttime frequency detail ('every other day or every two days') and lacks some specific transcript citations provided in the Gold Answer. The answer covers approximately 70-75% of the key points accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1], [P-15], [P-18], [P-9], [P-11]. However, it contains a significant hallucination in the Note section: it claims the patient 'did not explicitly confirm' chest tightness, when D-20 asks 'Do you feel it gets tight in your chest?' and P-20 responds 'Yes.' This directly contradicts the transcript. The environmental triggers mentioned are verifiable. Overall, mostly faithful but with one notable fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the question: specific symptoms (cough, breathing difficulties, wheezing), character details (dry cough), and daytime vs nighttime frequency differences. The structure is clear and focused on the question asked. The note about chest tightness, while factually incorrect, shows an attempt to address symptom completeness. No significant off-topic content, though the note section introduces an error rather than adding value."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates good relevance and addresses the question's core components effectively. It correctly identifies most key symptoms (dry cough, breathing difficulties, wheezing) and the daytime/nighttime frequency difference. However, it contains a critical factual error by stating chest tightness was NOT confirmed when the transcript clearly shows it was (P-20: 'Yes'). This error impacts correctness, completeness, and faithfulness scores. The answer also omits specific nighttime frequency details ('every other day'). Overall, it's a partially accurate response that would benefit from correcting the chest tightness claim and adding more specific temporal details."
