  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct in the details it provides. It accurately identifies the 3-month duration, the intermittent nature of the cough, the greenish sputum, the sleep disturbance, and the chest pain specifically associated with coughing. No false information was introduced.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. It misses several key symptoms reported in the Gold Answer, such as the subjective fevers (feeling hot at night) and the specific detail that the cough was initially dry before becoming productive 3 days ago. Most notably, it fails to list the majority of the symptoms the patient explicitly denied, including night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis (blood in sputum), foul smell, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All claims regarding the cough characteristics, sleep impact, and fatigue are supported by the provided text with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request for symptoms and denials. However, by omitting the bulk of the 'explicit denials' section, it only partially satisfies the specific requirements of the question."
