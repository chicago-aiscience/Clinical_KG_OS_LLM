  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer specifies what the doctor recapped in the end-of-visit summary (D-58): 3–4 days of dry cough, a little fever, some headache; no sputum; no recent sick contacts except brother with a cold ~2 weeks ago; no asthma; no meds aside from Claritin; and the purpose being “next steps/where to go from here.” It also specifies Jessica’s stated goal (P-60): to know if she needs medicine, plus wanting to go home and lie down (P-61).\n\nThe Generated Answer is not aligned with this. It does not accurately report several key recap items (no sputum, sick-contact exception, no asthma) and incorrectly identifies Jessica’s primary goal as “seek medical attention from this provider,” which is not what she said. It also introduces content not part of the doctor’s recap (scratchy throat, post-nasal drip) and mentions a “knowledge graph” mapping/identification not present in the transcript. Overall, major mismatches with the Gold Answer’s required elements and the question asked.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that should be covered:\n1) 3–4 day dry cough ✅ (included)\n2) little bit of fever ✅ (included, though via earlier line)\n3) some headache ✅ (included)\n4) no sputum/no bringing anything up ❌ (missing)\n5) sick contacts: none except brother cold ~2 weeks ago ❌ (missing)\n6) no asthma ❌ (missing)\n7) meds: only Claritin ✅/⚠️ (mentions Claritin but also adds birth control/Deyo, which was not part of the doctor’s recap and conflicts with “aside from Claritin” recap)\n8) doctor framed purpose as next steps/where to go from here ❌ (not captured as the doctor’s framing)\n9) Jessica’s goal: whether she needs medicine ❌ (incorrectly replaced)\n10) Jessica also wants to go home/lay down ❌ (missing)\n\nThis is well under half of the Gold Answer’s key points, and it omits the most important ‘goal/next steps’ element.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not grounded in the transcript as used:\n- References to a “knowledge graph” and KG-derived mappings/identifications are not in the transcript.\n- “Post-nasal drip” is mentioned by Jessica earlier (P-18), but it was not part of the doctor’s end summary being asked about; presenting it as part of the recap is not faithful to the question context.\n- “Primary goal…to seek medical attention from this provider” is not stated in transcript; Jessica’s goal is explicitly about whether she needs medicine (P-60).\n- Including “Deyo” as identified by a knowledge graph is extraneous and not part of the doctor’s recap.\n\nBecause it contains several non-transcript/unsupported additions and misattributes the patient’s goal, faithfulness is poor.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically about (a) the doctor’s recap at the end of the visit and (b) Jessica’s stated primary goal for next steps. The Generated Answer instead provides a broader symptom/history summary drawn from earlier parts of the interview and misstates the goal. It is partially on-topic (mentions some symptoms) but does not directly answer what was recapped in D-58 nor the correct next-steps goal in P-60."
