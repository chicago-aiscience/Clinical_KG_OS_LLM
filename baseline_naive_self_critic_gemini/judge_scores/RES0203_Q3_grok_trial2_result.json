  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three key symptoms (anosmia/loss of smell, ageusia/loss of taste, dry cough) matching the Gold Answer, accurately quotes D-39 for the doctor's connection to COVID-19, and specifies the swab test from D-39. However, it introduces a non-existent 'knowledge graph' and its contents, which is a factual inaccuracy not present in the Gold Answer or transcript, representing a minor discrepancy while core facts remain consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: three symptoms [P-1], doctor's connection via D-39 quote, swab test [D-39]. Missed: patient initially raising COVID concern [P-1], systematic confirmation of absent symptoms (fever [P-10], etc.), 'pretty well' summary [D-16, P-16], narrow symptom profile rationale, and self-isolation instructions [D-39]. Covers approximately 50-60% of Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms and citations [P-1, D-39] are verifiable in transcript; swab test accurate. However, references to 'knowledge graph provided' and its 'covid test' procedure are not in the transcript, representing hallucinated content that is implausible in this context.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by specifying the symptom combination, doctor's explicit connection via quote, and test method (swab), with only a minor irrelevant tangent on the knowledge graph."
