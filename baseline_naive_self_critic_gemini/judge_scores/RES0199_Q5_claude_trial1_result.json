  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims the doctor 'did not systematically explore' exposure sources, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor asked about: living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48], recent travel [D-49], and whether coworkers were sick [D-50]. The Generated Answer directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the actual transcript content.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to mention any of the key points from the Gold Answer: living alone in apartment, environmental exposures screened, workplace at car dealership, possible lunchroom exposure, no recent travel, no sick coworkers identified, and substance use screening. It covers 0% of the required content.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the actual transcript. The doctor explicitly asked about living situation [D-45], potential environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48], travel [D-49], and sick coworkers [D-50]. The claim that these questions were not asked is a hallucination that contradicts verifiable transcript content.",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer addresses the general topic of exposure investigation, it provides an incorrect answer that does not actually address what the doctor explored. It focuses on what allegedly was NOT done rather than what WAS systematically explored as requested by the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally flawed, incorrectly claiming the doctor did not explore infection exposure sources when the transcript clearly shows systematic inquiry about living situation, workplace, travel, sick contacts, and environmental factors. It contradicts both the Gold Answer and verifiable transcript content, provides no coverage of the actual exposure investigation conducted, and represents a hallucination rather than faithful analysis of the source material."
