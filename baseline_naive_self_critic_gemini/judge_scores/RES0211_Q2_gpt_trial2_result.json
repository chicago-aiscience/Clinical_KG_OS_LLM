  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies that Jessica has Claritin with her for seasonal allergies and is not currently taking it, and that she has received allergy shots in some years. However, it incorrectly states that no dosing details were mentioned: the transcript includes dosing/schedule details for both the allergy shots (once weekly for a while, in the winter before allergy season) and the oral contraceptive (a pill regimen that “goes for three months,” taken regularly). It also fails to name the contraceptive (“Deyo”), which is explicitly stated.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) Claritin for seasonal allergies, carried “just in case,” not currently taking; (2) prior allergy shots (not every year).\nMissed/insufficient: (1) contraceptive name “Deyo”; (2) contraceptive regimen detail (3‑month pill) and that she takes it regularly; (3) allergy-shot schedule (once weekly for a little while) and timing (winter before season); (4) she does not carry an EpiPen; (5) denial of medication allergies. Overall, it captures only part of the required meds/treatments and omits multiple key dosing/safety details requested.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (Claritin use/carrying; birth control use; history of allergy shots). The claim that “No specific dosing details … were mentioned” is not faithful to the transcript because multiple dosing/schedule details are explicitly provided (weekly shots; 3‑month OCP regimen). No clear hallucinated medications are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications and allergy-related past treatments, which directly answers the question. The main issue is omission of required specifics rather than inclusion of irrelevant material."
