  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the medications used for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and their lack of effectiveness, which is fully consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the second part of the question regarding medications or supplements taken as part of the patient's 'regular routine.' It misses the multivitamin mentioned in the Gold Answer and the transcript [P-25]. It also omits the context that the patient takes no prescription medications.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript [P-6], with no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question but only partially addresses the prompt's requirements by omitting the 'regular routine' medications/supplements."
