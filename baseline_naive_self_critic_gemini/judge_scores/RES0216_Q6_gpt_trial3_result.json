  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the clinician’s main assessment that asthma is likely recurring and that cardiac ischemia is lower on the differential (D-35, D-36). It correctly identifies the planned lung-focused physical exam (listening to lungs) and the therapeutic trial of a rescue inhaler, with reassessment if ineffective (D-35). A minor inaccuracy/overstatement is the claim that there is “no shortness of breath during exercise”; the transcript is more nuanced (patient reports difficulty getting a full breath; clinician says they didn’t “really get out of breath with exercise,” D-36). Overall, the core facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key required elements from the Gold Answer: (1) overall assessment of asthma recurrence as top differential, (2) planned physical exam with pulmonary auscultation, (3) first-step intervention with rescue puffer trial during walks, and (4) contingency plan to reassess and consider other causes/investigations if no improvement. It omits two secondary points present in the Gold Answer: explicit mention of consulting the supervising physician (“go talk to the doc,” D-35/D-37) and the explicit phrasing of a stepwise “one thing at a time” approach (D-36), though the contingency plan is still captured. Net: mostly complete but not 100%.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript, especially the exam plan, suspected asthma recurrence, and trial/contingency language (D-35, D-36). The only mildly unfaithful element is the simplified phrasing suggesting an absence of exercise-related dyspnea; the transcript suggests less classic exertional dyspnea but not a categorical absence. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question: assessment, planned physical exam component(s), first-step treatment, and what happens if it doesn’t work. No meaningful irrelevant tangents."
