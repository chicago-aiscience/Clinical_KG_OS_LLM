  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and the 'COVID test' as the specific test used, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-35]. It accurately notes the negative result ('I don't have it'). However, the timing is factually incorrect: it claims the test was during a 'prolonged period of symptom persistence' citing [P-13][P-14][P-35], but the transcript clearly states the test was 'when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago' [P-36], consistent with Gold. Workplace concerns are partially correct (scared coworkers [P-35]) but lack detail. Significant error on timing, a core question element.",
    "completeness": "Covered: Condition (COVID-19), test ('COVID test', negative), partial workplace concerns (coworkers scared [P-35]). Missed: Precise timing (at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior [P-36]), patient's hospital clerk role [P-34], PPE use [P-17], staying home post-test [P-36], eagerness to return without coughing [P-36], medication desire driven by work needs [P-35]. Covers roughly 50-60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Condition and test claims directly verifiable [P-35]. Workplace fear verifiable [P-35]. Timing claim not verifiable in cited sections ([P-13][P-14][P-35] discuss initial symptoms/cough persistence, not test timing); contradicts [P-36], indicating hallucinated/misinterpreted timing. Inference of 'priority to alleviate workplace anxiety' plausible but not explicit. Some ungrounded elements.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured with bullets directly addressing each question part (condition, test, timing, concerns), no off-topic content."
