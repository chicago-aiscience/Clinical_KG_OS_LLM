  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states no medications for current respiratory episodes (resolves on own), occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies, no prescribed medications, and no antibiotics for past viral infections. Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine (OTC antihistamine) for seasonal allergies and explicitly states no prescribed medications, aligning with core facts from [P-36], [P-46], [P-47]. However, it omits mention of no treatments for current episodes and past no antibiotics, and inaccurately implies Reactine is a regular/current medication ('the patient takes') rather than occasional. Minor discrepancies but core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) No meds/treatments for current wheezing/SOB, resolves with rest [P-33,P-34]; 2) Occasional OTC Reactine/antihistamines for seasonal allergies [P-35,P-36]; 3) No prescribed medications [P-36,P-46,P-47]; 4) Past viral infections no antibiotics [P-16]. Generated covers 2 and 3 (~50%), misses 1 and 4 explicitly.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine and OTC for allergies verifiable in [P-36]; no prescribed meds verifiable in [P-36,P-46,P-47]. However, 'Knowledge Graph explicitly links' is entirely hallucinated (no KG in transcript); 'the patient takes Reactine' misattributes to child vs. mother and exaggerates from 'sometimes'; 'specific names were not provided' ignores Reactine named. Some hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications/treatments (lists Reactine/OTC for allergies) and prescribed meds (none), structured relevantly to question on current/other conditions and prescribed management; minor irrelevance in hallucinated KG reference."
