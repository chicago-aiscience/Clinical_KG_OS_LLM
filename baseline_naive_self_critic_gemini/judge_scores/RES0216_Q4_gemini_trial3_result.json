  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the condition (cardiac ischemia/ischemic picture) and the two primary reasons cited by the doctor in the final assessment (D-36): the absence of classic exertional dyspnea ('out of breath') and the absence of chest pain.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the core facts but misses the additional 'pertinent negatives' included in the Gold Answer, specifically the absence of anxiety, sweating, and the feeling of impending doom (D-6), which the Gold Answer lists as part of the evidence for deprioritizing the condition.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, particularly the doctor's summary in D-36 and the patient's initial report in P-1 and P-5.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question (the condition and the symptom findings) without including irrelevant information."
