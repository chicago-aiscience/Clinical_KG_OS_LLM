  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error regarding systemic symptoms. It explicitly states that the patient 'did not report' fever or headache, whereas in the transcript (P-9, P-11), she says she felt like she had a fever, and in P-14, she confirms having 'maybe a little bit' of a headache. It also misses reduced exercise tolerance (P-4).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea) and identifies the most bothersome symptom correctly. However, it misses several key points from the Gold Answer: reduced exercise tolerance (walking the dog), fever, and headache.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contradicts the transcript by claiming the patient did not report fever or headache. This is a negative hallucination as the transcript clearly shows the patient confirming these symptoms when asked.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to address the specific components of the question, although it provides incorrect information regarding the systemic symptoms."
