  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple key date errors versus the Gold Answer/transcript. (1) Raspy cough: transcript indicates a mild raspy cough began Friday [P-3], with a marked worsening Sunday; Generated Answer places “initial onset” on Sunday and does not correctly anchor the raspy cough to Friday. (2) Fever: transcript indicates feverishness began Monday (“the Monday really is when I first started… felt hot”) [P-8], while Generated Answer attributes fever onset to Sunday [P-5], which misreads the patient’s statement (Sunday blood spots; next day fever) [P-5]. (3) Chest pain: transcript suggests onset around Tuesday (“specially notice over the last day” on Wednesday) [P-20]; Generated Answer does not specify onset day and implies it is simply current on Wednesday. (4) Chills timing (especially last two days) is consistent with Tue–Wed [P-9]. Overall, the core requested timeline is substantially incorrect on major symptoms (cough onset, fever onset, chest pain onset).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: yellow sputum with red spots starting Sunday; chills especially last two days; chest pain worsened by cough/deep breath; mentions exertional windedness and sore throat. Key elements missed or not fully specified: runny nose about a week prior and resolved [P-16]; explicit Friday onset of raspy cough [P-3]; explicit Monday onset of fever with persistence through Wednesday [P-8]; continuation of blood-tinged sputum into Monday [P-5]; explicit chest pain onset around Tuesday (“over the last day”) [P-20]. The overall worsening across the week is only partially traced because the earlier mild phase (Friday) and the Monday fever evolution are misdated.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded accurately in the transcript: attributing fever onset to Sunday is not supported and contradicts [P-8]; describing Sunday as the onset of the raspy cough is not supported given [P-3]. The answer also adds a framing of “based on…clinical knowledge,” though it does not introduce many new medical facts; the main issue is misinterpretation/hallucinated timing rather than added content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested symptom timeline and clinical progression, with only minor extraneous phrasing (e.g., “clinical knowledge”). It largely addresses the question’s structure (day-by-day onset and worsening), albeit inaccurately."
