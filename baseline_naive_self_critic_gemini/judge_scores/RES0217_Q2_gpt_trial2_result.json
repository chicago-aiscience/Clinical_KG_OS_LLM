  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient is on a statin for cholesterol (name not recalled) and that the clinician proposed prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72 hours attachment risk, and reiterated moving forward with antibiotics. It also correctly includes discussion of sending the tick for species ID and ordering bloodwork/serology. No incorrect antibiotic name/dose/duration is invented. Minor issue: it references a “knowledge graph” and adds the general statement that statins treat high cholesterol, which is not stated in the transcript (though it is generally true).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) current statin use for cholesterol, unspecified statin; (2) prophylactic antibiotics proposed/likely to proceed; (3) no antibiotic details provided; (4) tick sent to lab; (5) blood work/serology discussed. Key points missed: (a) patient denial of allergies/no drug allergies; (b) past tick bite ~10 years ago with bullseye rash treated with antibiotics; (c) plan to consult supervising/other physician before finalizing; (d) environmental prevention advice (consider insecticide/yard measures). Overall, roughly ~60–70% of Gold Answer content is included.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (statin use; prophylactic antibiotics; lab tick ID; bloodwork). The mention of “knowledge graph confirms” and the explicit claim that statins treat high cholesterol are not transcript-grounded (though medically plausible), representing minor unverified augmentation rather than major fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments discussed (statin therapy, proposed prophylactic antibiotics, and related diagnostic steps). The included diagnostic measures are relevant to management of the tick bite and Lyme risk. Minimal extraneous content aside from the ‘knowledge graph’ framing."
