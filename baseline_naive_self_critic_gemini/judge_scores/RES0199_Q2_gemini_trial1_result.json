  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct. It accurately identifies Tylenol as the home medication for headaches and correctly lists the doctor's recommendations (Tylenol/NSAIDs, hydration, nutrition, sleep, and isolation). While citation [P-1] for the medication is slightly inaccurate (it mentions the headache but not the medication), citation [P-3] is correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses two details included in the Gold Answer: the patient's self-initiated hydration efforts [P-30] and the specific mention of the COVID-19 swab test as part of the diagnostic/management plan [D-52]. It does include the isolation instruction which is part of that same plan section.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is completely faithful to the transcript. All medications and measures mentioned are explicitly stated by the patient and doctor in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the question, providing specific medications for the patient and doctor's recommendations."
