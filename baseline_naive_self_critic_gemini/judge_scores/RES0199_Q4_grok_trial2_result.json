  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. It correctly specifies the swab test and 24-48 hour turnaround time, directly from [D-52]. The alternative diagnosis of 'another viral illness' is precisely quoted and matches both Gold and transcript. No factual errors or discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: condition (COVID-19), test (swab), TAT (24-48 hours), alternative diagnosis (another viral illness). Generated Answer covers all 100% of these. Additional details in Gold (isolation, positive result handling, supportive management) are not required by the question and thus not impacting completeness here.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] with accurate partial quotes and citations (e.g., 'the first thing we want to rule out as covid', 'we'll take a swab', '24 to 48 hours', 'another viral illness'). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured bullet-point style directly addressing each element of the question (condition, test, TAT, alternative diagnosis) with no off-topic content or tangents."
