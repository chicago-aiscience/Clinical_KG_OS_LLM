{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript does not contain explicit instances of the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea. These are explicitly present in turns [D-10], [D-15], [D-16], and [D-17]. Because it bases its analysis on the false premise that these were absent from the dialogue, the core of the answer is incorrect.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to list the majority of symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as vision/hearing changes, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and numbness/tingling. It focused only on the examples provided in the prompt's parentheses and incorrectly claimed they were not in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails the faithfulness check significantly. It explicitly states that the symptoms were not mentioned in the transcript (specifically citing turns [P-1] through [P-27]), when in fact those exact turns contain the negations of the symptoms in question. This is a hallucination of absence.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the clinical differentiation part of the question, it does so based on a false statement about the transcript's content, making the response largely irrelevant to the actual dialogue provided."
