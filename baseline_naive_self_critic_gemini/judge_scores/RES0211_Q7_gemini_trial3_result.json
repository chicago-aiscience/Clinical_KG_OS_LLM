  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer misses the specific sequence mentioned in the transcript (P-4), where the patient explicitly states the scratchy throat came before the dry cough. Instead, it lumps them together as initial symptoms. It also characterizes the 'feeling hot' as a subsequent symptom/escalation, whereas the Gold Answer correctly notes that the transcript does not specify the exact day it began relative to the other symptoms, and the patient describes it as occurring 'all the time' (P-9).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the symptom of fatigue (P-13) and the descriptive detail that the sensation of heat was constant 'day and night' (P-9). It fails to differentiate the specific order of the first two symptoms (throat then cough) which was a key part of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source of information twice. It also makes an unsupported inference that the heat was a 'subsequent change' or 'escalation,' which is not stated in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in that it directly attempts to answer the specific questions about the order of symptoms and the relation of the heat to the timeline."
