  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with both the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test (results in 24-48 hours), the 14-day isolation period, the specific instruction to isolate from the younger sister, and the criteria for ER care (fever, neurological symptoms).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures all the specific items requested by the prompt (tests, duration, specific person). Compared to the gold answer, it misses some secondary management details such as the discussion of false negatives, the fact that no medications were prescribed (supportive care), and the context regarding the school requirement. These omissions place it in the 80% coverage range.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript, particularly section [D-44]. The citations provided are accurate and the answer does not include any hallucinated information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the specific structure requested in the question. It avoids the narrative padding found in the gold answer (e.g., household composition) to focus strictly on the management measures requested."
