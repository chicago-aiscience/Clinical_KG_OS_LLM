  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript. It correctly identifies the loss of taste, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, fever, weakness, and decreased appetite. It notes that the headaches were described as stress-related. There are no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer missed one specific sensory change mentioned in the Gold Answer and the transcript: the diminished sense of smell [P-6]. It also includes 'Difficulty breathing (laborious)' which, while present in the transcript, was technically excluded by the prompt's instruction to look 'beyond' the chief complaint of shortness of breath.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms listed in the generated answer are found in the source transcript. The citations [P-2, P-3, P-4, P-7, P-11, P-12] are accurate and correspond to the patient's statements.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, although it includes a description of the breathing difficulty ('laborious') which the prompt specifically asked to go beyond. However, it categorizes the symptoms as requested (sensory, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, and constitutional)."
