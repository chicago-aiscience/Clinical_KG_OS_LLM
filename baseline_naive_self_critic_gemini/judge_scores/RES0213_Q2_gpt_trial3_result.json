  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC products the patient tried for chest discomfort (Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer) and accurately reports that they \"hasn't really helped very much\" [P-6]. No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) Tylenol, (2) Advil, (3) Alka‑Seltzer, and (4) limited/ineffective relief. Misses: the patient’s regular routine supplement (daily multivitamin) [P-25] and the clarification that they take no other medications besides that. (Gold Answer also mentions non-medication stress strategies and smoking reduction, but those are not strictly required by the question.) Overall, it omits a key part of what was asked: regular OTC/supplement use.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (medications tried and lack of benefit both stated in [P-6]). No hallucinated medications/supplements or effects are introduced.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses OTC attempts for chest pain and their effectiveness, but does not address the regular supplement portion of the question (multivitamin), so it is only partially responsive."
