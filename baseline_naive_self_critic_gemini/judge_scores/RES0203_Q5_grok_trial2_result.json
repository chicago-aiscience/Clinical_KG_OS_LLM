  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies the hiking trip two weeks ago with the partner, where 'some people kind of brushed by us' [P-18], as the specific potential exposure event the patient pinpointed, noting they could not recall other sources [P-18] and denied sick contacts [P-17]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states the living situation with family [P-29] as the specific exposure event identified by the patient, which the patient did not identify as such; this is a major factual contradiction with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: patient in high school online [P-36,P-37], mostly home [D-38,P-38], specific exposure hiking 2 weeks ago with partner, people brushed by [P-18,P-19], no other sources or sick contacts [P-17,P-18], lives with family but no illness [P-29], doctor tests due to symptoms [D-39]. Generated covers online classes/staying home (partial), symptoms, doctor test recommendation, but completely misses the hiking exposure (core point) and wrongly frames family living as exposure; covers <20% accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verifies living with parents/sibling [P-29], online classes [P-37], staying home [P-38], symptoms [P-1], doctor notes COVID consistency [D-39]; however, patient explicitly identifies hiking as potential exposure [P-18] ('I don't see where else...'), not family living, and denies sick contacts [P-17]; Generated hallucinates family living as the 'specific potential exposure event identified by the patient', which is not grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer attempts to directly address the question by naming an exposure event (family living) and linking to COVID suspicion via symptoms/test, staying within the question's scope of exposure history and connection to diagnosis, with no major off-topic content; however, it uses the wrong event."
