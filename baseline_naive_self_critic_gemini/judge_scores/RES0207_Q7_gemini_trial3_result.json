  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by stating the transcript does not document a temperature check, whereas [P-5] explicitly records a temperature of 37.4 C. It also states the seizure occurred 'while in bed', while the patient says they were fine after the seizure and then 'went to bed' [P-8].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the dry cough [P-4], the specific timing of the symptoms (3 hours prior) [P-11], and the contextual reason for the missed medication (the daughter's birthday) [P-24]. It also fails to include the temperature check despite the prompt explicitly asking for it.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinations the absence of the temperature data. Additionally, it references a 'knowledge graph' and '[RISK_FACTOR]' labels which are not present in the source transcript, indicating the use of external training data or incorrect prompting logic rather than sticking to the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to reconstruct the timeline as requested, but by failing to find the temperature check and missing the cough, it only partially addresses the prompt's specific requirements."
