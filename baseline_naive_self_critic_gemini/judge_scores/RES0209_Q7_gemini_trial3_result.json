  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain information about the patient's diagnosis at age eight or their baseline bronchodilator usage of once every two weeks. Both pieces of information are explicitly mentioned in the text (P-2 and P-8). This is a significant factual error regarding the contents of the source text.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to address the temporal evolution requested by the question. It misses the 2-year disease history (age 8 to 10), the specific '5-6 times per week' current usage frequency, and the observation that wheezing episodes exceed bronchodilator use. It only covers the 'current' symptoms section of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a 'negative hallucination' by asserting that the provided documentation lacks historical context, when in fact that context is present in the transcript. While the details it does extract about current symptoms are grounded in the text, the overall claim about the source's limitations is false.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer only partially addresses the question. By refusing to answer the parts regarding the patient's history and baseline (claiming they are missing), it fails to provide the requested 'evolution over time' which was the core of the prompt."
