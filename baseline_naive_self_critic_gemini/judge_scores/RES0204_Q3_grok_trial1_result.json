  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the persistent dry cough (4-5 days, non-improving) and some pertinent negatives (fever/chills, sore throat, chest pain, nausea, headache), and quotes the transcript rationale for chest X-ray accurately [D-37]. However, it inaccurately describes the cough as 'chronic' (4-5 days is acute), introduces unsupported Knowledge Graph references and clinical inferences (e.g., subtypes of symptoms, mild COVID variants), omits key Gold details like clear runny nose emphasis, normal taste/smell, no sick contacts/travel, family asthma history, and novelty of dry cough, and reframes COVID swab rationale as inferential logic rather than explicit standard protocol [D-39], leading to some factual errors but main point intact.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: persistent dry cough (100%), some negatives (fever/chills, sore throat, chest pain ~50%), CXR for 'better look' (full), COVID as response to symptoms (partial). Missed: clear runny nose details/citations, full negatives (taste/smell normal, muscle/back pain, headaches full context, nausea/vomiting/abd pain citations), no sick contacts/travel, family asthma hx, novelty of dry cough, absent high-acuity markers emphasis, exact COVID protocol quote. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like cough duration/character, listed negatives, and CXR/COVID quotes [P-2,P-5,D-37,D-39 etc.] are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, hallucinations include Knowledge Graph connections (not in transcript), 'chronic' cough mischaracterization, 'refusal to report' fever (denial, not refusal), COVID as 'hallmark' with variant speculation (plausible but not grounded), and expanded differentials (bronchitis/pneumonia/foreign body) not stated by doctor. Multiple unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how persistent cough + absent red flags led to CXR (visualize lungs) and COVID swab (rule out virus), structured step-by-step matching question's focus on present/absent findings combination; minor tangents like Knowledge Graph and extra differentials."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer partially captures the clinical rationale with accurate transcript quotes for main symptoms and tests but introduces hallucinations, omits key Gold details like full negatives and protocol, resulting in moderate correctness and completeness."
