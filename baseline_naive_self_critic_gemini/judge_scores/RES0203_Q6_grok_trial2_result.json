  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states assessment includes symptoms consistent with COVID and patient otherwise well [D-16, D-39]; Generated covers consistent with COVID but omits 'otherwise well' and adds untranscribed terms 'anosmia' and 'ageusia'. Correctly covers COVID test, swab, timeline, isolation [D-39]. However, Generated incorrectly states 'No additional tests...mentioned' contradicting Gold/Transcript [D-40: 'there might be a couple other tests']. Similarly, denies supervising physician consultation despite [D-40: 'go over this with the doctor that I'm working with']. Mentions non-existent 'knowledge graph'. Significant contradictions on key management points.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Assessment (symptoms consistent COVID, otherwise well); (2) COVID swab test; (3) Self-isolation details; (4) Timeline (day or two); (5) Possible additional tests; (6) Consult supervising physician + possible more questions; (7) Reassurance 'taken care of'. Generated covers (1 partial: symptoms consistent but misses 'otherwise well'), (2), (3), (4). Misses (5), (6), (7) and incorrectly denies (5),(6). Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on assessment/test/isolation/timeline verifiable [D-39]. 'Anosmia/ageusia' plausible but not in transcript (hallucinated terms). 'Knowledge graph' fully hallucinated. Denials of additional tests/follow-up/consult contradicted by [D-40], not verifiable and false. Multiple hallucinated/inaccurate claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response directly matching question elements (assessment, tests w/method/timeline, self-care/isolation, additional tests/follow-up/consult), with no off-topic content despite errors; perfectly focused."
