  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the patient's current statin therapy for cholesterol [P-15] and the doctor's proposal for prophylactic antibiotics due to potential Lyme disease risk after >72 hours attachment [D-6, D-13, D-18], matching Gold. It omits past antibiotics for prior tick bite [P-3], allergies [P-16, P-17], and environmental insecticide suggestion [D-18], but does not contradict any facts. Minor addition of 'knowledge graph' is extraneous but core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: current statin/no name [P-15], cholesterol [P-14], no allergies [P-16/17], past antibiotics [P-3], new prophylactic antibiotics/no specifics/consult physician [D-6/13/18/22], environmental insecticide [D-18]. Generated covers current statin (full), prophylactic antibiotics (full), but misses allergies, past treatment, physician consult details, and insecticide (~60% coverage). Adds diagnostics (tick ID, bloodwork) which Gold omits but are discussed.",
    "faithfulness": "Statin [P-15], cholesterol [P-14], prophylactic antibiotics [D-6/13/18], tick ID [D-6/18], bloodwork [D-18] all directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. 'Knowledge graph confirms statins treat high cholesterol' is hallucinated (no knowledge graph in transcript), but minor and only one instance; rest fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question on current statin and new prophylactic treatments for tick bite; structure focuses on these with supporting transcript quotes; added diagnostics are part of discussed management and on-topic."
