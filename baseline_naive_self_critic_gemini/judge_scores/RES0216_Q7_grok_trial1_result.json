  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states symptoms began 3 days ago on a walk with dog [P-4], no specific trigger [P-3], staying the same/pretty steady [P-2,P-3], always there but exacerbated by walking dog, rising from chair, big breath [P-9,P-10], noticeable on inspiration [P-1,P-5], reduced walks from couple to one per day [P-22]. Generated correctly notes 3-day onset [P-1], tightness always there esp on inspiration [P-1,P-9], exacerbated by walking dog [P-1,P-9,D-10], rising from chair/deep breath [P-9]; however, it inaccurately describes progression as 'persistent but intermittent' (contradicts 'staying the same' and 'always there' baseline), omits no specific trigger and explicit first notice on walk [P-4], and wrongly states patient maintains normal walking routine (contradicts reduction to one walk [P-22]). Significant contradictions on progression and impact.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: 3-day onset (yes), first noticed on walk (implied but not explicit), exacerbated by walks/chair/breath/inspiration (yes), always there baseline (partial). Missed/contradicted: no specific trigger (missed), staying the same/steady (missed, called intermittent), reduced to one walk/day (contradicted as maintains normal), no work missed/limiting activity (missed). Covers ~40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: onset [P-1], always there/worse on walk [P-9,D-10], exacerbators [P-1,P-9]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'Knowledge graph data... [KG]' (no KG in transcript), 'intermittent' (not in transcript, contradicts 'always there' [P-9]), 'maintains normal daily walking routine' (contradicts [P-22]). Multiple hallucinated/misrepresented facts.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly around onset/development, progression, exacerbating factors, and impact on walking routine, perfectly matching the question's focus with no off-topic content aside from minor irrelevant KG mention."
