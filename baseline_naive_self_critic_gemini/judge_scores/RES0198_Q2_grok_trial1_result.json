  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies 'decongestants' as tried medication with accurate citation [P-10]. Patient's assessment is quoted as 'worked a little bit' [P-10], matching Gold but omitting the nuanced explanation of ambiguity and reasoning (stuffy to runny transition). Recommendation specifies 'Tylenol cold' [D-39], aligning with Gold's OTC example, but Gold includes additional supportive details like hydration and viral timeline. Core facts consistent, minor discrepancies in depth.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: tried 'decongestants' ✓ [P-10]; assessment 'worked a little bit' partial (misses ambiguity and full reasoning) [P-10]; OTC 'Tylenol Cold' ✓ [D-39]. Missed: hydration as supportive care, viral infection context, 'few weeks' resolution timeline [D-39]. Covers core question elements (80-99%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'decongestants' and 'worked a little bit' from [P-10]; 'Tylenol cold' from [D-39]. Citations accurate, no hallucinated content or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer uses bullet points to precisely address the three-part question (medication tried, assessment, recommended OTC) with no off-topic content or tangents."
