  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on the core question. It provides a general summary of the transcript instead of identifying the specific findings the doctor recapped in the summary (D-58). For instance, it includes 'post-nasal drip' and 'birth control,' which the doctor did not mention in the recap. Most importantly, the 'Primary Goal' section is factually incorrect; it claims her goal was to see her family doctor (based on a response in P-22 about past doctors), whereas the Gold Answer correctly identifies her goal from the end of the visit: to know if she needs medicine and to go home to rest.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the doctor's recap in D-58, such as the fact that the patient has no history of asthma, has not been bringing anything up (sputum), and that her brother was the only recent sick contact. It also fails to capture the specific goals Jessica stated at the end of the visit (medicine and rest).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the 'Primary Goal' by misinterpreting a statement from P-22. In P-22, Jessica is simply answering a question about other doctors she has seen in her life; she does not identify seeing a family doctor as her goal for this specific appointment. The actual goal is stated in P-60 and P-61.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to list clinical findings and goals, it ignores the specific constraint to identify what was 'recapped' in the doctor's summary at the end of the visit. By pulling information from the entire transcript indiscriminately, it fails to provide a relevant answer to the specific prompt."
