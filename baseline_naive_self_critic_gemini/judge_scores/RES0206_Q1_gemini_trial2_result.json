  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it states that the patient did not report fever or headache. However, in [P-9] the patient mentions feeling like she had a fever and felt really hot, and in [P-14] she confirms having a headache. The rest of the respiratory symptoms and the most bothersome symptom are correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It omits the patient's report of reduced exercise tolerance (trouble walking her dog/around the block from [P-4]); 2) It misses fever and headache as positive systemic symptoms; 3) It does not include the pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer claims the patient 'did not report' fever and headache, which is a direct contradiction of the transcript evidence in [P-9] and [P-14]. This is an incorrect assertion rather than a complete hallucination of a new fact, but it demonstrates a failure to ground the answer in the full transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the question, addressing respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, and the most bothersome symptom."
