    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. All major components (physical exam, tick lab testing, blood work, antibiotics, physician consultation, and preventive advice) are correctly identified with appropriate citations. The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor's plan without introducing factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) physical exam of bite site, (2) tick species identification at lab, (3) blood work for Lyme serology/titres, (4) prophylactic antibiotics with reasoning (>72 hour attachment, geographic risk), (5) physician consultation (trainee consulting attending), and (6) preventive advice about tick habitats and insecticide use. The Generated Answer omits the specific detail about the tick being in a plastic container and doesn't emphasize the geographic risk from Strathroy as explicitly, but these are minor omissions that don't affect core completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer appropriately references specific dialogue markers [D-6], [D-13], [D-18], [D-22] that correspond to actual statements in the transcript. No hallucinated information is present. The answer correctly represents what the doctor said without fabricating details about antibiotic specifics (which were not provided in the transcript).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question, which asks for the comprehensive clinical plan including diagnostic tests, treatments, physician consultation, and preventive advice about the garden/outdoor environment. The answer is well-organized into these exact categories and stays focused on the clinical plan without including irrelevant patient history or unrelated dialogue."
