  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated working diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold), COVID swab testing with ~48-hour turnaround, and isolation/public health follow-up guidance. It does not introduce any clear contradictions or clinically incorrect statements relative to the Gold Answer/transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) working diagnosis = viral infection/common cold, (2) supportive care = hydrate + OTC Tylenol Cold, (3) COVID swab ordered today with results in ~48 hours, (4) isolate at home/avoid others while awaiting results, (5) further instructions from public health after results.\nKey point missed: the doctor’s expectation-setting that symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve and that there is not much beyond supportive care for a viral infection.",
    "faithfulness": "All included elements are directly supported by [D-39]. The answer stays grounded in the transcript; no notable hallucinated recommendations (e.g., antibiotics, nasal sprays) were added. Minor framing (e.g., ‘manage symptoms while waiting’) is consistent with what was said.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested items: diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance. No meaningful tangents."
