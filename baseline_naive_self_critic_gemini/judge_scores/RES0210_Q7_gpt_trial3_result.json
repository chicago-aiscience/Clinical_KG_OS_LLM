  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several substantive timeline errors vs the Gold Answer:\n- Raspy cough onset: Gold = Friday (\"bit of a raspy cough on like Friday\"), but Generated Answer places onset on Sunday and does not identify Friday as first appearance.\n- Fever onset: Gold = Monday (\"started, the Monday\"), but Generated Answer states fever began Sunday.\n- Overall worsening on Sunday: Gold specifies cough became \"really bad\" on Sunday; Generated Answer does not clearly capture that key worsening point and instead frames Sunday as the initial onset.\n- Right-sided chest pain onset: Gold places onset around Tuesday (\"noticed over the last day\" on Wednesday); Generated Answer does not specify onset day and implies it is simply current.\nCorrect elements: Sunday onset of yellow sputum with red spots is consistent; chills being prominent in the last two days (Tue–Wed) is consistent; pleuritic nature of chest pain is consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are missing or inadequately captured:\n- Runny nose about a week prior that resolved.\n- Clear day-by-day onset for raspy cough (Friday) and fever (Monday).\n- Explicit statement that Sunday represented a significant worsening (cough became \"really bad\").\n- Continuation of blood-tinged sputum into Monday.\n- Chest pain onset around Tuesday (\"over the last day\").\nIncluded but incomplete: chills timing (captured generally), exertional windedness and sore throat (mentioned), but the required symptom-first-appearance timeline is not fully and accurately specified.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not supported by the transcript or are misattributed:\n- \"Fever\" on Sunday is not supported; the patient states fever started Monday.\n- \"Raspy cough\" starting Sunday is not supported; patient specifies raspy cough on Friday.\n- The phrase \"Based on the transcript and clinical knowledge\" signals extrapolation; while most content is drawn from the transcript, the key timing errors indicate unfaithful reconstruction rather than minor paraphrase.\nOther claims (sputum description Sunday; chills last two days; chest pain worse with deep breath/cough) are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely focused on the requested timeline and symptom progression (cough/sputum/fever/chills/chest pain) and attempts to describe worsening over the week. However, because it fails to accurately specify the onset day for multiple required symptoms, it only partially fulfills the task despite staying on-topic."
