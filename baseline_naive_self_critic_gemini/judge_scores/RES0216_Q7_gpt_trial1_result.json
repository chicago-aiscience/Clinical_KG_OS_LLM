  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states onset ~3 days prior and that the tightness is present at baseline and worsens with walking, deep inspiration, and getting up from a chair, which aligns with the transcript ([P-1], [P-9], [P-10]). However, it introduces important inaccuracies: (1) it characterizes the symptom as “persistent but intermittent,” whereas the patient describes it as “kind of always there”/pretty constant with exertional worsening ([P-9]); (2) it implies the patient maintained the normal daily walking routine, but the patient reports reducing from “a couple of walks a day” to typically “just one” over the last few days ([P-22]); and (3) it fails to accurately report the overall trajectory as “staying the same” ([P-2]).",
    "completeness": "Key gold points covered: ~3-day duration; baseline constant tightness; worse with walking, standing from chair, deep breath; inspiratory predominance. Key gold points missed or inadequately stated: explicitly that it was first noticed while out on a walk ([P-4]) (the answer links walking but doesn’t clearly state this was the first moment noticed); that there was no specific trigger/“just kind of came on” ([P-3]); that symptoms have been overall “staying the same”/steady ([P-2], [P-3]); functional impact of cutting walks down to one per day ([P-22]) (it states the opposite); and no missed work/limited day-to-day impact ([P-21], [P-22], [P-23]).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript or conflict with it. The mention of “Knowledge graph data confirms…” and citation “[KG]” is entirely unsupported by the provided transcript. The claim that the patient “maintains their normal daily walking routine” contradicts [P-22]. The “persistent but intermittent” framing is also not faithful to the patient’s description of constant baseline symptoms. These issues reduce grounding substantially.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements (onset timing, evolution, exacerbating factors, and impact on walking). There are no major tangents, though the unsupported “knowledge graph” sentence is unnecessary. Overall, it addresses the question but incompletely and with some incorrect assertions."
