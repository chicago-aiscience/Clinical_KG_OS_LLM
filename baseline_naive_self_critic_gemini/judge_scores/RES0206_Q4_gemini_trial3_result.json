  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition to rule out (COVID-19) and the test ordered (COVID swab). However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain information about social contacts. The transcript explicitly mentions the patient meeting friends to walk dogs and one friend being sick [P-20], which is the core detail requested in the third part of the question.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses one of the three main components of the question. It provides the condition and the test but fails to describe the social contact detail that prompted the diagnosis, which is a significant part of the gold answer's detail.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer makes a false claim about the source material, stating the transcript lacks information regarding social contacts or exposure history when this information is clearly present in turn [P-20]. This is a hallucination of absence.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant in that it attempts to answer all three parts of the prompt, though the third part is answered incorrectly."
