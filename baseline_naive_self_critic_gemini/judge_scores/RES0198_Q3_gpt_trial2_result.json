  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly notes that the clinician explicitly assessed the illness as “most likely a viral infection like the common cold” [D-39] and that the history included absence of several systemic symptoms (e.g., fever/chills, headache, loss of taste/smell) that makes an uncomplicated viral URI plausible. However, it overstates inference by implying the clinician “ruled out” bacterial infection based on these negatives; bacterial vs viral was not explicitly ruled out in the transcript, and some queried negatives (e.g., sore throat) are not specific to bacterial disease. It also introduces an unsupported “knowledge graph” justification and a generalized “high-exposure environment” claim that goes beyond what was said (the doctor mentioned the pandemic and testing, not that exposure was high).",
    "completeness": "Gold answer key supports for viral vs allergic/bacterial included: (1) isolated nasal congestion/rhinorrhea with absent cough, SOB, fever/chills, sore throat, post-nasal drip; (2) mostly clear discharge; (3) ~1 week, fairly constant course consistent with viral URI; (4) progression from stuffiness to runny; (5) factors arguing against allergy (no allergen exposures, no allergy history, no similar recurrent episodes); (6) factors arguing against bacterial (no fever/headache, no colored discharge); (7) daycare contact as possible viral exposure.\n\nGenerated answer covers: clinician’s explicit viral conclusion; some absent systemic features; pandemic/COVID testing context.\n\nIt misses major Gold points: clear discharge, duration/timing and progression, explicit absent cough and post-nasal drip, and most of the allergy-exposure history (no known allergies; no dust/fumes/animals) and daycare exposure nuance. Overall coverage is well under ~50% of the Gold elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: referencing a “knowledge graph” as a source; claiming the symptoms are “explicitly associated” with viral illness in that graph; and implying a “high-exposure environment” beyond the doctor’s simple mention that symptoms can be seen in COVID and recommending testing/isolation. Most other statements (symptoms queried, negatives, pandemic/testing) are supported. Because multiple key justifications are unsupported, faithfulness is moderate.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on explaining why viral was favored, but it only weakly addresses the ‘rather than allergic’ part (does not use the exposure/allergy history that was discussed). Still, it largely stays on-topic without major tangents."
