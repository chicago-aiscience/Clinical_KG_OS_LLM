  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the specific questions about fever [D-7/P-7], runny nose [D-8/P-8], sick contacts [D-10/P-10], recent travel [D-11/P-11], rashes [D-13/P-13], and phlegm production [D-31/P-31] 'were not captured in the provided transcript,' which is a factual error as they are explicitly present; it fails to accurately map these to screened conditions (e.g., infectious causes, URTI, contagious etiologies) as in the Gold Answer, instead vaguely referencing acute infections vs. asthma, leading to major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers all specified questions with citations, associated conditions screened (e.g., pneumonia, URTI, viral wheeze, allergic/viral rashes, productive cough), patient denials, and narrowing to reactive airway disease; Generated Answer covers 0% of these key points, focusing instead on unrelated aspects like cold weather triggers, seasonal allergies, and exercise pattern.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of the queried questions despite their clear presence in the transcript with exact citations; while some secondary claims (e.g., allergies [P-35], cold weather [P-38]) are verifiable, the core denial of transcript content is a fabrication, making it largely ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "The question directly asks about screening via the six specified questions and narrowing responses; Generated Answer dodges this by falsely denying their presence and shifts to other transcript elements (e.g., triggers, nocturnal symptoms), providing largely off-topic content."
