  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It incorrectly states the patient tried medications to manage episodes, when P-6 shows they tried medications that didn't help (not that pain resolves with them). It misattributes D-18 quote 'several times a day' which isn't in the transcript. Most significantly, it incorrectly claims pain correlates with anxiety attacks and doesn't happen 'any other time' based on P-20, which actually states heart fluttering only happens during anxiety attacks, not the chest pain. The quality and duration are mostly accurate, but situations of occurrence lack important details about resolution when engaged with others.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers some key points but misses critical information from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the sharp pain with deep breathing and 20-minute duration, and mentions studying/walking situations. However, it fails to include: (1) pain resolves/goes unnoticed when engaged with others or doing hands-on tasks, (2) pain occurs when patient is alone with thoughts, (3) pain can occur at rest, (4) no worsening with exercise, (5) no preceding injury, (6) no prior occurrence before this episode. The answer covers approximately 40-50% of key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations. The claim that pain 'correlates with anxiety attacks' and the quote 'any other time' from P-20 is a misrepresentation - P-20 discusses heart fluttering during anxiety attacks, not chest pain. The statement that patient tried medications to 'manage' episodes implies they help resolve the pain, which contradicts the transcript showing medications didn't help. The 'several times a day' attribution to D-18 is inaccurate as this quote doesn't appear in that exchange. While some facts are grounded (sharp pain, 20 minutes, walking/studying), multiple fabricated interpretations undermine faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question about chest pain characteristics, quality, duration, and situations. It attempts to cover all requested dimensions but includes irrelevant information about medication trials (which relates to patient's response to pain rather than pain characteristics themselves) and incorrectly discusses anxiety attack correlation. The answer stays mostly on topic but conflates different symptoms and includes tangential information, making it only partially relevant to the specific question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It contains multiple factual errors, including misattributing anxiety attacks to chest pain episodes and incorrectly citing transcript locations. Critical information about pain resolution when engaged with others, occurrence at rest, and absence of prior episodes is omitted, covering less than 50% of key points from the Gold Answer. The response includes hallucinated claims about anxiety correlation and misrepresents medication use. While it attempts to address the question's main components, the combination of factual inaccuracies, incomplete coverage, and fabricated details results in a below-average evaluation across all dimensions."
