  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incorrect. The transcript explicitly includes proposed diagnostic procedures: a chest X-ray ([D-37]) and a COVID swab ([D-39]). It also explicitly states the rationale for the COVID swab: they are doing it for anyone who comes in with these symptoms lately ([D-39]). The Generated Answer’s claim that the interaction “cuts off prior to the doctor making any medical decisions” directly contradicts the provided transcript.",
    "completeness": "It misses essentially all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) chest X-ray proposal and purpose, (2) COVID nasal swab proposal, (3) the specific rationale that it was institutional/standard screening for symptomatic patients, and (4) the plan to arrange these tests and return with the supervising doctor. Therefore coverage is <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is not faithful to the transcript because it asserts there is no mention of diagnostic procedures or rationale for COVID swabbing, despite clear statements in [D-37] and [D-39]. While it does not add many new fabricated facts, it materially misrepresents what is present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is framed as responding to the question, but it does not provide the requested diagnostic procedures or rationale and instead incorrectly claims the information is unavailable. This is only minimally responsive to the prompt."
