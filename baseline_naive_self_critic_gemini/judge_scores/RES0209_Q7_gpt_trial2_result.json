  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that it is not possible to address the evolution from diagnosis at age eight or baseline bronchodilator use. In the transcript, the patient explicitly states they were diagnosed at age 8 (P-2) and that baseline bronchodilator use was “maybe once every two weeks or so” (P-8). It also fails to accurately report the key escalation in bronchodilator use to “almost everyday like five six times a week” (P-8), instead describing only a nonspecific increase. It misattributes/loosely cites chest tightness as [D-20] (it is reported by the patient at P-20). It also conflates “every other day / every two days” (P-18) with “wheezing” frequency; in context this is nighttime symptoms. While portions describing current cough/SOB/wheeze are consistent with the transcript, the central claim of insufficient historical context is factually wrong versus the source and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: current dry cough, SOB, wheezing, chest tightness; triggers (exercise, cold, pollen/spring).\nKey points missed: diagnosis at age 8 and current age 10 (2-year history); baseline bronchodilator frequency once every ~2 weeks; explicit escalation to near-daily 5–6 times/week; clarification of duration (initial “past week or so” then “last two weeks”); wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use (uses only when very hard to breathe); nighttime symptoms as a distinct feature; denial of infectious symptoms/precipitants. Overall, it covers only a minority of the Gold Answer’s required timeline and usage evolution.",
    "faithfulness": "Most symptom/trigger statements are grounded in the transcript (P-1, P-9, P-11, P-15, P-16, P-18–P-20). However, it introduces an extraneous reference to a “knowledge graph” not present in the transcript, contains at least one inaccurate citation (chest tightness), and makes an ungrounded meta-claim that historical/baseline information is unavailable (contradicted by P-2 and P-8). These issues reduce faithfulness, though the clinical content it does provide is largely plausible and transcript-consistent.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically for the evolution over time from diagnosis to baseline to current exacerbation and increased bronchodilator use. The Generated Answer largely declines to answer that evolution and focuses mainly on the current exacerbation, omitting the baseline and diagnosis timeline that are explicitly in the transcript. Thus it only partially addresses the question."
