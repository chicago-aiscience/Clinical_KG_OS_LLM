  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains factual inaccuracies regarding the patient's symptoms. It states that the cough outlasted symptoms such as fever and nausea, but the patient explicitly denied having fevers [P-12] or nausea [P-20] in the transcript. Additionally, it refers to an external 'Knowledge Graph' which does not exist in the provided source material.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all three primary factors requested (acid reflux, hay fever, and occupational exposure) and includes the post-viral context. However, it misses the Gold Answer's nuanced point that the absence of pharmacological treatment for reflux suggests it may not be fully controlled.",
    "faithfulness": "There are multiple instances of hallucination. The mention of a 'Knowledge Graph' explicitly linking terms is a fabrication not found in the source. Furthermore, attributing fever and nausea to the patient's initial presentation contradicts the patient's own statements in the transcript where they denied those specific symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing directly on the prompt's requirement to relate the three specific medical/occupational factors to the patient's persistent cough."
