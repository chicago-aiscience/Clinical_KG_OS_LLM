{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the gastrointestinal and infectious categories. However, it attributes the cardiac differential solely to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea/vomiting), while completely omitting the primary cardiac screening questions asked in the transcript: chest pain [D-7] and feeling faint [D-8]. This provides a skewed clinical reasoning compared to the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer. It fails to mention the screening for: chest pain, feeling faint, runny nose, contact with sick individuals, recent travel, sputum production, and prior similar episodes. It covers approximately 40% of the specific screening items listed in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms and systems mentioned in the generated answer (GI, sensory, respiratory) are present in the transcript with correct speaker tags. There are no hallucinations of external facts.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question (symptoms/exposures and differential diagnoses) and stays focused on the clinical encounter without irrelevant tangents."
