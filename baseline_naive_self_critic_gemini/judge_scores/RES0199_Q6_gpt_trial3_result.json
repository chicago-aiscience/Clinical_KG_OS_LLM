  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the key elements in the Gold Answer that it includes: COVID-19 swab test, 14-day isolation, contact tracing only if the result is positive, and supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep/rest, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Minor wording differences (e.g., “any pain” vs “anything like that”) do not materially change meaning and are consistent with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer omits: (1) the expected COVID swab result timeframe (24–48 hours), (2) the doctor’s note that if not COVID it could be another viral illness going around, and (3) the explicit statement that no prescription medications were ordered beyond supportive measures. It otherwise covers the major plan components and supportive care items.",
    "faithfulness": "All included recommendations are grounded in [D-52] of the transcript (swab, isolate 14 days, public health contact tracing if positive, hydration/nutrition/sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). The slight expansion to “any pain” is still consistent with “anything like that” and does not introduce a clear hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested management plan elements (test ordered, isolation duration, contact tracing condition, supportive care) and does not add irrelevant material."

  "summary": "The answer is accurate, faithful, and highly relevant, but it is missing several elements included in the Gold Answer (result timeframe, alternative viral-illness possibility, and the note about no prescriptions), reducing completeness."
