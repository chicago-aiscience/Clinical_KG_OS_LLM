  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error regarding the source text. It explicitly states that 'dyspnea' (difficulty breathing) and 'sore throat' were not in the transcript, whereas they are clearly present in segments [D-11/P-11] and [D-13/P-13]. It also fails to identify several other negative findings mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the majority of the negative findings. It only lists three categories (fever, headaches, allergies), whereas the Gold Answer and transcript include difficulty breathing, sore throat, chills, night sweats, muscle aches, chest pain, sputum/blood in cough, and environmental triggers. It covers less than 30% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer claims that certain symptoms were not identified in the provided transcript segments, which is a hallucination/error of omission because those symptoms (dyspnea and sore throat) were explicitly discussed in the text provided.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to follow the structure of the prompt (listing symptoms and explaining clinical implications), it fails the 'List all' requirement and provides incorrect information about the availability of data in the transcript."
