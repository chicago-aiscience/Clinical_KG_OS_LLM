  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect compared with the Gold Answer. The transcript clearly includes the doctor’s end-of-visit summary assessment and plan in [D-47] and a closing statement in [D-48]. The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the consultation “has not reached a conclusion” and that there is “no corresponding Doctor turn” after [P-47], despite [D-48] being present. It also incorrectly lists symptoms such as “pleuritic chest pain” and “night sweats” as part of the history; the patient denies night sweats in [P-5], and chest pain is not described as pleuritic (patient says it only hurts when coughing [P-3]).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points all missing: (1) doctor’s summary assessment at [D-47] (chronic cough ~3 months, worse last 3 days, nighttime awakening, green sputum, no blood, no constitutional symptoms); (2) doctor’s stated plan to review the story with supervising doctors; (3) that no tests/treatments were ordered and next steps depend on the supervising physician’s assessment. The Generated Answer provides none of these and instead states the information is unavailable.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript: claiming there is no conclusion/plan despite [D-47]/[D-48]; claiming night sweats as part of the history despite explicit denial; and adding “pleuritic chest pain.” These represent significant unfaithfulness to the source text.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to address the question (plan, assessment, next-step guidance), but it does so by incorrectly asserting that these elements are not present. It remains on-topic, but fails to provide the requested content."
