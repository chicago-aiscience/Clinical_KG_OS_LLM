  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the initial symptom (stuffy nose), followed by fever and sore throat. It accurately mentions muscle ache and correctly states the husband's week-long symptom duration versus the patient's three-day fever duration. However, it lacks the explicit confirmation of the stuffy nose-to-fever progression found in D-2/P-2/D-3/P-3, and doesn't clearly establish the temporal relationship between fever and muscle aches (concurrent, 2-3 days). It also misses the key insight that the husband's illness began ~4 days before the patient's fever onset and the household transmission pattern discussion.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the basic symptom sequence and comparative timeline but misses several key details: (1) the explicit confirmation dialogue about symptom progression, (2) the precise timing that muscle aches appeared concurrently with fever over 2-3 days (not just mentioned as occurring), (3) the calculation that husband's symptoms started ~4 days before patient's fever, (4) the staggered onset pattern suggesting household transmission, and (5) the doctor's acknowledgment of this pattern in differential diagnosis. Covers approximately 60% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript. The stuffy nose onset is in P-1, fever duration of three days is in P-1, sore throat ongoing is in P-1, muscle ache is in P-13, and husband's week-long symptoms are in P-19. No hallucinated content detected. Citations are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by describing symptom progression and comparing timelines with the husband. All content is relevant to the question asked. No tangential information included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate but incomplete account of the symptom progression. It correctly identifies the initial stuffy nose, followed by fever (3 days), sore throat, and muscle ache, and accurately notes the husband's week-long symptoms. All claims are well-grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations. However, it lacks important details about the concurrent timing of fever and muscle aches, the specific ~4-day gap between husband's and patient's illness onset, and the clinical significance of this staggered pattern for household transmission. The answer is fully relevant but would benefit from greater depth and precision in temporal relationships."
