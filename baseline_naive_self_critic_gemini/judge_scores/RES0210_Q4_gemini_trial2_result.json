  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the contents of the transcript. It claims the patient provided no information regarding recent travel or chemical exposure, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions the patient traveled to Sarnia [P-23] and works as an engineering consultant for a chemical plant [P-33, P-34]. It also suggests screening for Malaria and Dengue for a patient who traveled within Ontario (Sarnia), which is clinically inappropriate compared to the Gold Answer's focus on Legionella or fungal infections.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to identify Sarnia as the travel destination and therefore misses the analysis of domestic vs. tropical infection risks. It also fails to capture the specific occupational role (engineering consultant) which the Gold Answer uses to explain why chemical injury is less likely.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a major hallucination of omission. It repeatedly states that information (travel and chemical exposure) was not provided in the transcript segments, even though those details are clearly present in [P-23] and [P-33/34]. This is a failure to ground the response in the provided source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each of the four categories requested by the prompt. It attempts to provide a differential diagnosis and narrowing logic for each, even though the underlying data used is incorrect."
