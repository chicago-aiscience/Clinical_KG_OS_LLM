  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main respiratory symptoms (dry cough and runny nose) with accurate characterization. It correctly notes the cough duration (4-5 days), its non-productive nature, and lack of improvement. The runny nose description as 'pretty clear' and lasting 'past couple of days' is accurate. The mention of sore throat denial is appropriate as a pertinent negative, though it wasn't explicitly requested in the question.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the essential elements requested: identifies respiratory symptoms, characterizes the cough as non-productive/dry, and describes nasal discharge appearance as clear. However, it misses some details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the explicit patient confirmation of no sputum/gunk production [P-6], (2) the cough staying 'the same' in severity [P-7], (3) the patient's statement about never having this type of cough before [P-24], and (4) additional pertinent negatives like chest pain denial and absence of wheezing/shortness of breath.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. All claims are verifiable: cough duration [P-2], dry/non-productive nature [D-5, P-5], runny nose [P-11], clear discharge [P-12], and sore throat denial [P-9]. The reference to 'knowledge graph' appears to be an artifact from the system's processing but doesn't constitute hallucination as the clinical facts stated remain accurate and traceable to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by identifying respiratory symptoms and their characteristics. The focus on cough nature (productive vs. non-productive) and nasal discharge appearance is exactly what was requested. The sore throat mention, while a pertinent negative, is slightly tangential to the specific question asked but still clinically relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies and characterizes the two main respiratory symptoms (dry/non-productive cough and clear nasal discharge) with correct details and proper transcript citations. However, it lacks some supporting details present in the Gold Answer, such as explicit patient statements about sputum absence, symptom progression, and additional pertinent negatives. The answer is fully faithful to the transcript and highly relevant to the question asked."
