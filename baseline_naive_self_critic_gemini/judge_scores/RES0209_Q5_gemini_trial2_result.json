  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) and the family history (sister with asthma). It correctly links pollen to the suspicion of allergies. However, it makes a distinction that pollen is an 'allergy trigger' rather than an 'asthma trigger' based on an external knowledge graph, whereas the Gold Answer and clinical context treat it as an asthma trigger (allergic asthma). It also fails to mention the specific escalation in inhaler frequency noted in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main triggers and family history. However, it misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific quantitative increase in rescue inhaler use (from once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week), which is crucial for defining the 'current exacerbation'. 2) The clinician's recommendation for a medication change to improve control. 3) The detail that no other family members have allergies or breathing problems.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer repeatedly cites a '[KG]' (Knowledge Graph) which is not present in the provided source transcript. This represents a hallucination of a source or the use of external training data presented as a provided reference. While the clinical facts are generally plausible, the attribution is unfaithful to the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the components of the question, structuring the response around the triggers, family history, and the allergy suspicion."
