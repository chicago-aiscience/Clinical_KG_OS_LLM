  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a minor factual discrepancy regarding the duration of mucus production. It states the productive phase lasted 2-3 days, while the patient explicitly states in [P-6] that the mucus lasted for the first 4-5 days. Other facts regarding the resolution of flu symptoms and the transition to a dry cough are correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several specific details requested by the prompt and present in the Gold Answer. It fails to describe what the mucus looked like ('whitish clear'), and it does not address how the cough's intensity and frequency changed over time (remaining stable/the same, 3-4 times per hour). It also omits the COVID test mention which provides context for the symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The claim about mucus lasting 2-3 days is likely an inference from [P-14] where the patient says 'everything else resolved in the first 3 or 4 days', though it contradicts the more specific statement in [P-6]. No significant hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and structured to address the timeline as requested, although it lacks the granular detail requested by the prompt's specific sub-questions."
