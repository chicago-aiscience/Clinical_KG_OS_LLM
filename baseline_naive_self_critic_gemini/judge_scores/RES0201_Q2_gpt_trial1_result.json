  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient’s ongoing COPD medication as a long-acting beta agonist [P-28] and correctly lists the sore-throat self-care attempts (salt-water gargles and painkillers) and that they were ineffective [P-6]. It does not introduce major factual contradictions. Minor issues: it states the LABA is used to treat COPD (clinically true but not explicitly stated in the transcript) and frames COVID-19 as a “suspected diagnosis,” whereas the transcript says symptoms are in line with COVID-19 and that they will probably do a swab [D-43].",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: LABA for COPD; salt-water gargles; painkillers; no relief.\nKey points missed from the Gold Answer: the patient also takes “a couple of vitamins” [P-30]; the Gold Answer’s additional items (no allergies [P-31] and social/substance history: quit smoking, occasional alcohol, no cannabis/other drugs [P-34–P-38]) were not included.\nOverall, it captures the core medication/treatment question but misses several elements present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references for the key medication and self-treatment measures. However, the answer includes non-transcript artifacts/placeholders (“knowledge graph,” [MEDICAL_HISTORY], [SYMPTOM], [DIAGNOSIS]) and adds an interpretation (LABA indicated for COPD; “suspected diagnosis” COVID-19) that is not stated verbatim. These are minor but reduce strict grounding.",
    "relevance": "It largely addresses the asked medications/treatments (COPD med and sore-throat self-treatment). It includes some extra context (mono history, COVID-19 suspicion) that is not directly asked, but the tangents are limited."
