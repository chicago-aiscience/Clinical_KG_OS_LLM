  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states patient took Tylenol for headache relief citing [P-3] and [P-4]; Generated correctly identifies Tylenol for headache but inaccurately cites [P-1] (which discusses symptoms, not Tylenol) alongside [P-3]. Gold includes patient's self-initiated hydration [P-30] as home symptom relief; Generated omits this. Doctor's recommendations match closely (Tylenol/NSAIDs, supportive measures), with minor omission of 'if you get any' for fevers and explicit COVID swab (implied by isolation). No major contradictions, core facts accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: Tylenol for headache (partial citation), doctor's Tylenol for fevers, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches, hydration, nutritious food, sleeping well, isolation. Missed: patient's home hydration effort [P-30], explicit COVID swab, statement of no prescriptions. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: Tylenol usage in [P-3]/[P-4], doctor's plan verbatim from [D-52]. Minor issue: inaccurate citation [P-1] not mentioning Tylenol (hallucinated link), but content verifiable elsewhere. No fabricated facts.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response to question parts (home medication/symptom, doctor's meds/supportive measures) with no off-topic content, perfectly focused."
