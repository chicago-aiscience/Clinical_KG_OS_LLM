  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains one significant factual error regarding the diarrhea onset. It states diarrhea began '4 days ago' when the Gold Answer and transcript [P-28] clearly indicate it started '2 days ago.' All other facts are accurate: dry cough [P-12], vomiting two times [P-32], headache severity 7/10 [P-8], persistent headache [P-3], and 4-day onset for cough and headache [P-1].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but omits several important details from the Gold Answer: no sputum/blood in cough [P-13], cough stable over 4 days [P-11], respiratory negatives (no SOB, wheezing, chest pain), no blood in diarrhea [P-29], vomit contents description [P-34], GI negatives (no bloating, constipation, appetite changes), headache location (bilateral forehead/top of head) [P-5], no neck radiation/stiffness [P-6, P-7], unusual for patient [P-10], loss of smell [P-24], and mild fatigue [P-19]. Coverage is approximately 40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with proper citations. However, the diarrhea onset claim contradicts the transcript evidence. The statement 'five or six times a day' is accurately cited [P-28]. The vomiting timeline 'yesterday' is correctly noted [P-32]. All other claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by providing information about GI symptoms (diarrhea and vomiting), respiratory symptoms (cough), and headache characteristics including nature, frequency, episodes, and severity. The response is well-focused and organized by symptom category without irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a focused response covering the main symptom categories requested, but contains a significant factual error on diarrhea onset (stating 4 days instead of 2 days). While the answer is well-organized and relevant, it omits approximately 50-60% of key clinical details present in the Gold Answer, including important negative findings, symptom characteristics, and additional reported symptoms like loss of smell and fatigue. The answer demonstrates good faithfulness to the transcript with accurate citations for most claims."
