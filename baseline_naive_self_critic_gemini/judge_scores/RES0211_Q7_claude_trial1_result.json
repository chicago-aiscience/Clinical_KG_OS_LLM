  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It incorrectly states that Jessica first noticed the cough and scratchy throat together, when the Gold Answer clearly establishes from [P-4] that the scratchy throat came FIRST, followed by the cough. The Generated Answer also does not accurately represent the timeline of the 'feeling hot' symptom - it suggests this was a 'subsequent' symptom that 'followed' the respiratory symptoms, but the transcript does not establish this temporal sequence. The Gold Answer correctly notes that the exact timing of the heat sensation relative to throat/cough is not specified in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: (1) The specific sequence of scratchy throat THEN cough [P-4]; (2) The persistent, constant nature of feeling hot 'all the time' both day and night [P-9]; (3) The specific details about wearing shorts and tank top while still feeling hot; (4) The explicit statement that the transcript does not specify when the heat sensation began relative to throat/cough; (5) The doctor's characterization as 'a little bit of fever' [D-58]; (6) The characterization of progression from localized upper airway to systemic symptoms. The answer covers some elements (malaise, headache, fever association) but misses critical timeline details.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer makes an unsupported inference about temporal sequence, stating that feeling hot 'followed' and was 'subsequent to' the respiratory symptoms, and represented an 'escalation' or 'shift.' The transcript does not provide evidence for this specific timeline. While the answer correctly cites [P-1] and [P-7], it extrapolates beyond what these citations support regarding temporal relationships. The reference to a 'Knowledge Graph' appears to be hallucinated content not present in the provided materials.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about symptom order and timeline, and attempts to relate the feeling hot to cough/throat symptoms. However, it provides an incorrect answer to the core question about initial symptom order, which reduces its relevance despite being on-topic."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error in the symptom sequence (stating cough and throat together rather than throat first, then cough) and makes unsupported temporal claims about when the 'feeling hot' symptom appeared. It misses key details about the persistent nature of the heat sensation and the lack of specific timeline information in the transcript. While the answer addresses the question topic, the incorrect ordering and incomplete coverage of key points from the Gold Answer significantly undermine its quality."
