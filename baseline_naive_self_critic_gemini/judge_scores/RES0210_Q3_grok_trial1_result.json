  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures core symptoms like productive cough with yellow 'custard' sputum [P-6] and red spots [P-4, P-6], exertional dyspnea [P-10], and pleuritic chest pain worsening with deep breaths [P-19] and coughing [P-18], matching Gold. Minor discrepancies include citing fever at [P-5] (Gold uses [P-8] for timing), omitting chills [P-9], not detailing pain as constant/dull/present at rest [P-20,21], and missing smoking risk [P-37,38]. No major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers: productive cough/purulent sputum with red spots; fever (partial); exertional dyspnea; pleuritic chest pain details and explanation. Misses: chills [P-9]; full pain characterization (constant, dull, present lying still); smoking as predisposing factor. Approximately 80% coverage of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about symptoms and citations ([P-1,4,5,6,10,17,18,19]) are verifiable in transcript. However, multiple hallucinations include repeated references to a non-existent 'knowledge graph' and its relations (e.g., '[TRIGGER] exertion --[TRIGGERS]--> [SYMPTOM] short of breath'), 'clinical documentation,' and 'pathophysiology' notes not in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing transcript-specific findings supporting LRTI/pneumonia and explaining pleuritic pain's role; knowledge graph tangents are minor."
