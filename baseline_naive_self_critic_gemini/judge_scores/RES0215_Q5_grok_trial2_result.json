  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies and links seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36], recurrent viral infections [P-15], and cold weather sensitivity [P-38] to airway hypersensitivity and exercise-induced wheezing, aligning with the Gold Answer's atopic and trigger concepts. However, it factually errs by claiming no information on new carpets (present in [P-54]), contradicting both the transcript and Gold Answer's inclusion as a potential irritant. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' absent from materials, introducing discrepancies. Core relations are mostly preserved, but significant errors on key factor.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: seasonal allergies/atopy [P-35/36], recurrent virals as triggers [P-15/16], cold as trigger [P-38], exercise pattern [P-3/6/41]. Missed: new carpets as irritant [P-54], other environmental assessments [P-53/55/56/57], full integration into hyperresponsive airways profile. Covers ~70% of points, omitting one queried factor entirely.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on allergies, virals, cold, and symptoms verifiable with accurate citations [P-35/36/15/38/1/3/6]. Hallucinates absence of new carpets (falsely limits transcript to [P-1]-[P-43], ignores [P-54]). Repeatedly references non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' as source. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around question's factors (allergies, virals, cold, exercise pattern), explaining collective relation to wheezing/distress. Minor off-topic via Knowledge Graph mentions and erroneous carpet denial, but focused overall."
