  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer highlights doctor's explicit mention of 'fever and sore throat' [D-53] as key for infectious etiology, plus broader cluster ('muscle aches, little bit of fever, stuffy nose, sore throat' [D-24]) and husband's symptoms [D-53]. Generated correctly identifies fever, sore throat [D-53], and stuffy nose from patient [P-1], but omits muscle aches and husband's symptoms; core facts on symptoms and doctor's suspicion for COVID/infectious align, with minor omissions/discrepancies in full supporting details.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: fever/sore throat [D-53]; broader symptoms (muscle aches, fever, stuffy nose, sore throat [D-24]); husband similar symptoms [D-53]; no flu shot [P-53]. Generated covers fever, sore throat [D-53], stuffy nose [P-1], no flu shot [P-53]; misses muscle aches and husband explicitly (covers ~80% of points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable: patient symptoms [P-1], doctor's summary [D-53/D-24 implied], flu shot exchange [D-53/P-53/D-54]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details, citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses the question by specifying symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat) for infectious/COVID suspicion with citations, and vaccination history (no flu shot) for influenza differential; no off-topic content."
