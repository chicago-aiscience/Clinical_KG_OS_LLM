  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the bronchodilator as the sole asthma medication, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript (e.g., P-4, P-6). However, it incorrectly states that the administration method is not specified in the transcript, contradicting the Gold Answer and direct evidence of it being a 'puffer' (D-7, P-7). It also erroneously claims there is no segment where the doctor asks about a daily controller medication, directly contradicting D-5 ('do you have one that you take every day no matter what?') and the Gold Answer. These are significant factual errors on core elements of the question.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) sole medication is bronchodilator/rescue inhaler used as-needed (covered partially); (2) administered via 'puffer' (missed entirely); (3) patient denied other medications (covered implicitly); (4) doctor asked about daily controller/maintenance med taken every day, patient does not have (missed entirely); (5) clinical context of increased use and potential addition (not covered, and Gen adds irrelevant triggers). Covers roughly 25-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about bronchodilator usage are grounded (P-1, P-9, P-11). However, assertion that administration is unspecified hallucinates absence despite 'puffer' mention (D-7, P-7). Claim of no doctor question on daily controller fabricates absence of D-5 content. Adds plausible but extra details on triggers. Multiple hallucinations of omission.",
    "relevance": "Addresses the 'only medication' part somewhat directly but fails to cover administration and misrepresents the daily controller inquiry as absent, instead diverting to unrelated symptom questions (D-19, D-20). Includes tangential trigger details. Partially relevant with key misses."
