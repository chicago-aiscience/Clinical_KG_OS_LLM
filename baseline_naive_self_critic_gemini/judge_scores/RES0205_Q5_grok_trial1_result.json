  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer cautiously links acid reflux as potentially uncontrolled without meds, hay fever as historical sensitivity without current symptoms/active role, and occupational exposure as infectious risk despite PPE; Generated accurately identifies the three factors and their citations but overstates hay fever's role via assumed post-nasal drip (not current in transcript), calls reflux GERD and implies active irritation without noting dietary control success, adds unmentioned 'respiratory irritants' and references a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph'; core relations match but with interpretive discrepancies and minor additions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: acid reflux (history, dietary management only, helped but potentially uncontrolled); hay fever (history, no current symptoms); occupational (hospital clerk, PPE/careful); post-viral pattern; anxiety context. Generated covers all three histories and their potential links to cough, persistent dry cough outlasting symptoms, negative COVID, coworker distress; misses explicit lack of meds/'helped quite a bit' nuance for reflux, no current hay fever caution, post-viral label, anxiety as context—covers ~85% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verifies histories (P-22 reflux, P-27 hay fever, P-34/P-17 occupation/PPE), symptoms timeline (P-14/P-5/P-6 dry after mucus), COVID test (P-35), chest soreness (P-15); unverifiable/hallucinated: 'Knowledge Graph' link (absent), current post-nasal drip from hay fever (initial mucus resolved, no allergy symptoms mentioned), 'constant respiratory irritants' in hospital (not specified), detailed mechanisms like 'gastric acid irritation of larynx' (external knowledge, not transcript); multiple added claims not grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the exact three elements in the question (acid reflux, hay fever, hospital clerk), explaining each's potential contribution to persistent cough outlasting other symptoms, with no off-topic content."
