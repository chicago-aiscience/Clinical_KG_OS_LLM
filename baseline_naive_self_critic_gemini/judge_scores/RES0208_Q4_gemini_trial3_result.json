  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect regarding the source text. It explicitly claims the transcript does not contain the doctor asking about or the patient denying chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, or nausea. However, these are clearly present in the transcript: Runny nose [D-10, P-10], Nausea [D-15, P-15], Chest pain [D-16, P-16], and Palpitations/fast heart rate [D-17, P-17].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to list the specific symptoms requested (except by mentioning them in its denial of their existence). It misses several other negated symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as changes in vision/hearing, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and numbness/tingling. While it provides a clinical differentiation analysis, it is framed as a hypothetical because the model failed to find the evidence in the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a significant failure in faithfulness. It hallucinates that the information is missing from the transcript when it is explicitly stated in multiple turns. It references specific turns like [D-3] and [D-36] but ignores the clearly relevant turns [D-10] through [D-22].",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it bases its entire response on the false claim that the transcript lacks the necessary information. It attempts to answer the 'how' part of the question using general knowledge rather than extracting the logic from the dialogue's context."
