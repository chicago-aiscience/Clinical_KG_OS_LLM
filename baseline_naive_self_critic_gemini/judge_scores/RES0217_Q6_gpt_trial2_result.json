  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the plan described in the transcript and matches the Gold Answer’s elements: quick physical exam, sending the tick for species ID, ordering Lyme serology/titres, starting prophylactic antibiotics, and discussing with/being seen by a supervising physician. Preventive advice about ticks in long grass/wood-field edges and considering insecticide is correctly represented. Minor potential over-interpretation: stating the physician discussion is to “confirm the treatment plan” is implied but not explicitly stated as confirmation (though supervision/physician review is clearly indicated).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer components covered: (1) physical exam; (2) tick sent to local lab for identification; (3) blood work for titres/serology; (4) prophylactic antibiotics; (5) plan to speak with physician/supervising doctor; (6) preventive advice about tick habitats and using insecticide. Minor omissions vs Gold Answer: it does not explicitly include the tick “waving motion with their legs” description, does not explicitly mention the Strathroy geographic-risk rationale and the >72-hour attachment rationale (it alludes to timeframe/risk assessment), and does not note that no antibiotic name/dose/duration was specified.",
    "faithfulness": "All included plan elements are grounded in the transcript: D-18 supports physical exam, lab tick ID, blood work, and insecticide/garden advice; D-6/D-13 support prophylactic antibiotics and risk framing; D-13/D-18 support physician involvement. No clear hallucinated diagnostics or treatments beyond what was discussed.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested comprehensive clinical plan: diagnostics (lab/physical), treatments, physician consultation, and garden/outdoor preventive advice. No notable irrelevant tangents."
