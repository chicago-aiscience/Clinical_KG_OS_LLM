    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer regarding the medication tried (decongestants), the patient's assessment (worked a little bit), and the doctor's recommendation (Tylenol cold).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary points but misses some secondary details found in the gold answer, such as the doctor's recommendation to stay 'well hydrated' and the context regarding the expected duration of symptoms (a few weeks). It also excludes the patient's specific reasoning for why they felt the decongestant worked (transition from stuffy to runny).",
