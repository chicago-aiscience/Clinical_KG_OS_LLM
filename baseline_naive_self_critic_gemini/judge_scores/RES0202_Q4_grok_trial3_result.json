{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition from [D-45] and fever (with accurate citations to [P-1], [P-2]) as the excluding factor leading to infection focus, matching Gold's core facts; minor addition of fever duration from [D-3] (doctor's statement) is consistent with transcript though not emphasized in Gold as excluding factor.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: asthma condition ([D-45]), hypothetical presentation (cough/SOB without fever), excluding finding (fever with temp details and cites), shift to infection ([D-45]); misses supporting details like no wheezing [P-7], uncertain SOB [P-8], and nuance of not permanently ruling out asthma (covers ~85% of Gold).",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims verifiable in transcript with accurate quotes/cites ([D-45], [P-1], [P-2], [D-3]); minor unverifiable detail is reference to non-existent 'knowledge graph provided' (hallucination), but content otherwise fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly and fully addresses question by naming condition (asthma) and specific finding (fever), with precise transcript support and no off-topic content."
