  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered and ruled out, consistent with [P-28]. It accurately lists the mother’s cited pertinent negatives (no shortness of breath, no wheezing, even with physical activity), which match the transcript. No factual contradictions to the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Covers: asthma; absence of shortness of breath and wheeze even with physical activity; general “anything like that.” Misses: explicit mention that the grandparents had asthma (the positive family history context) and that the patient had already “been worked up for that” (prior evaluation) as part of the rationale for ruling asthma out. Does not include the additional contextual negative from [P-24] noted in the Gold Answer (generally healthy/never had a dry cough like this), though that is less central to what the mother cited.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by [P-28] and are not embellished beyond the transcript. No hallucinated clinical details or unsupported assertions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what condition was ruled out and what specific findings (including lack of symptoms with activity) supported ruling it out. No irrelevant content."
