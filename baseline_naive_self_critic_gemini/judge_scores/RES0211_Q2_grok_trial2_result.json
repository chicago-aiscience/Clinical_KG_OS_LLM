  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Claritin (name, indication as seasonal allergies, carrying 'just in case' but not actively taking) and birth control (current taking), and allergy shots from allergist in past. However, it misses the specific name 'Deyo' for birth control, its description as a 3-month oral pill, the shots' dosing ('once a week for a little while in winter'), no EpiPen, no medication allergies, and seasonal nature without severe symptoms. It inaccurately states 'no specific dosing details' for birth control when 'goes for three months' is mentioned, and omits it for shots. No contradictions, but minor discrepancies in details and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: Claritin (name, indication, status, citations); birth control (taking it); allergy shots (past from allergist, not every year). Missed: 'Deyo' name; 'oral contraceptive pill that goes for three months'; confirmation not IUD; no medication allergies; shots dosing/schedule; no EpiPen; allergies are seasonal without swelling/breathing issues. Covers roughly 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about Claritin, birth control, and allergy shots are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-16, P-25]. No hallucinations or fabricated content. The claim 'no specific dosing details' is incorrect as dosing is mentioned (birth control 'goes for three months' [P-27], shots 'once a week' [P-20]), but this is a minor overstatement of absence rather than invention.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by structuring response into current medications/carrying (Claritin, birth control) and past treatments (allergy shots), including names, indications where available, and noting dosing absence. No off-topic content; perfectly focused."
