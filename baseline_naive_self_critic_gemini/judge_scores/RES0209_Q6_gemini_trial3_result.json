  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain the clinician's plan, diagnosis, or mention of a COVID-19 test, medication changes, or consultation with a supervisor. All these elements are explicitly present in the provided transcript (D-29 and D-43).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the three key points required by the question: it misses the COVID-19 swab, the medication adjustment suggestion, and the consultation with the supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source text by asserting that information is missing when it is clearly documented. It provides an accurate summary of symptoms but fails the primary task of identifying the plan.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant as it explicitly refuses to answer the specific question about the clinician's plan, instead pivoting to a summary of symptoms and history which was not the focus of the prompt."
