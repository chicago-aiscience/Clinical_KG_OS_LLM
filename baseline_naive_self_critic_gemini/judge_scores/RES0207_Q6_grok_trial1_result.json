  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that no next steps were communicated and misidentifies the end of the transcript (claiming it ends at [P-26] or [D-22] with patient speaking), while the Gold Answer accurately cites [D-37] and [D-38] where the doctor explicitly outlines reviewing with another doctor, returning shortly, and discussing potential tests or next steps. This is a complete factual contradiction with multiple errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: next steps outlined in [D-37]; review with other doctor ([D-37]); collaborative decision-making; return shortly ([D-37, D-38]); possible tests and management plan ([D-37]); no specifics ordered; patient agreement ([P-37]); farewell ([D-38]). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying any communication occurred.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends abruptly during patient's speech at [P-26]/[D-22] with no further doctor turns, but transcript continues to [D-38] with clear doctor statements on next steps. Wrong citations (e.g., [P-26] is family history, not end) and ignores verifiable [D-37]/[D-38]; largely fabricated.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by claiming no next steps, decision-makers, or follow-ups were mentioned, with no off-topic content or tangents."
