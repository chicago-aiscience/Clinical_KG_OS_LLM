  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Claritin and birth control as current medications and allergy shots as a past treatment. However, it incorrectly states that no specific dosing details were mentioned; the transcript explicitly mentions the birth control 'goes for three months' [P-27] and allergy shots were 'once a week' [P-20]. It also fails to provide the specific name for the birth control ('Deyo') which was mentioned in [P-26].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer: the name of the birth control ('Deyo'), the specific dosing/duration of the birth control (3-month cycle), the frequency of the allergy shots (once a week), and the fact that she does not carry an EpiPen (relevant to the 'carrying with her' part of the prompt).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded, but the claim that 'No specific dosing details... were mentioned' is a hallucination of omission, as that information was present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's categories, although it fails to extract all the requested specific details (names and dosing)."
