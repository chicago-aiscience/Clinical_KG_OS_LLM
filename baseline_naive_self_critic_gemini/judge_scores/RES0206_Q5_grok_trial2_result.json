  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the 20-year smoking history and sick contact exposure are not mentioned in the transcript, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence ([P-40] for smoking half a pack/day for 20 years; [P-20] for sick friend during dog walks). It partially acknowledges infection worsening COPD ([D-43]), aligning with one aspect of the Gold, but fabricates absences and misses smoking as primary COPD risk factor, leading to mostly incorrect content vs. Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: smoking as primary COPD risk ([P-40], [P-7]), quit at diagnosis, persistent damage/inhalers ([P-26]), sick contact details ([P-20]), exposure -> infection symptoms (sputum [P-1], sinus [P-12], etc.), patient recognition ([P-3],[P-23]), doctor confirmation ([D-43]). Generated covers only ~10% (vague infection -> exacerbation), misses all smoking relation and specific sick contact chain.",
    "faithfulness": "Unverifiable/hallucinated claims include absence of smoking/sick contact (falsely stated, directly in transcript), 'knowledge graph' and 'KG' mappings/extractions (no KG provided in source). Partial grounding in [D-43] and [P-1] symptoms, but multiple fabrications make it largely not grounded.",
    "relevance": "Addresses infection trigger partially but explicitly refuses to answer core question elements (smoking relation, sick contact chain), introduces off-topic KG; partially relevant to exacerbation chain but evades specifics."
