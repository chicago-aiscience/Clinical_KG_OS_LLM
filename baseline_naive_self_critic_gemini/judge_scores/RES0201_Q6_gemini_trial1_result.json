  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns perfectly with the gold answer and the source transcript. It accurately identifies the assessment (COVID-19 symptoms), the specific tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), the initial isolation period (until results), and the criteria for continued isolation (persistence of symptoms even if negative).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points. It identifies the two diagnostic tests and the isolation protocols correctly. However, it misses the minor detail mentioned in the gold answer regarding the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician/colleague ('document') before finalising the next steps, which was part of the overall management workflow.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript, specifically [D-43]. It correctly attributes the isolation instructions and the diagnostic tests to the doctor's statements without hallucinating outside information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the question: assessment, tests, isolation instructions, and conditions for continued isolation."
