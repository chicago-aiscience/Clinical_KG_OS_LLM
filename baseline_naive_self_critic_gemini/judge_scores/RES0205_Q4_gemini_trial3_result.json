  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 and the COVID test. However, it is imprecise regarding the timing of the test. The transcript states the test was performed 'when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago' [P-36], whereas the generated answer vaguely states it was conducted 'during this prolonged period of symptom persistence'.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses significant details from the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the patient's role as a hospital clerk [P-34], which is a primary reason the exclusion was important (occupational risk and infection control). It also fails to mention the specific timeframe of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer slightly misinterprets the transcript [P-36] regarding timing. By suggesting the test was done during the 'prolonged period,' it contradicts the patient's statement that the test was done at the very beginning of the symptoms. Other details are grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and directly addresses the four parts of the question, although with varying degrees of detail."
