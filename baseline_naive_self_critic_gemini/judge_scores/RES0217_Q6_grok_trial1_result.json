  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript without errors or contradictions. Diagnostics match exactly (physical exam, tick to lab, blood work). Treatment is correctly described as prophylactic antibiotics with appropriate reasoning (timeframe and risk). Consultation plan aligns with doctor's intent to discuss with supervising physician. Preventive advice covers insecticide and yard inspection locations precisely, though minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'surveillance' vs. 'take a look') are not erroneous.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: All 3 diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick ID including patient-provided specimen, blood work for titres/serology). Treatment (prophylactic abx due to >72h and risk, no specifics). Consultation (talk to doctor/physician). Preventive (insecticide for garden, ticks in long grass/woods-fields). Missed minor details: explicit >72h phrasing in treatment, Strathcona geographic risk citation, tick in plastic container, waving legs description, trainee-supervised nuance. Covers ~90-95% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in cited transcript sections: physical exam [D-18], tick lab [D-6/D-18], blood [D-18], abx [D-6/D-18], consultation [D-13/D-18/D-22 implied], insecticide/inspection [D-18]. No hallucinations; rephrasing like 'surveillance' is grounded in 'take a look... see if there's any'. Citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured and focused on question components: diagnostics (physical/lab), treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice on garden/outdoor. No off-topic content or tangents."
