  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns closely with the Gold Answer in core concepts: eczema as atopic marker priming airways, cat allergy supporting atopy and hyperresponsiveness, vaping as irritant exacerbating sensitivity, and their combination lowering threshold for chronic inflammation leading to symptoms. Minor discrepancies include exaggerating vaping frequency as 'regularly' (transcript: once every 2 weeks), assuming cat exposure without documentation (Gold explicitly notes none documented), and adding specific vaping chemicals/nicotine not in Gold or transcript. Core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: eczema/atopy risk for reactive airways and chronic cough (covers 3-month cough indirectly), cat allergy as atopic support and airway irritation, vaping irritants impairing defenses, collective lowered threshold for inflammation/symptoms, greenish sputum. Links to additional symptoms like sleep disruption and exercise impact. Misses explicit note on no cat exposures around onset (P-13-15), no formal testing/diagnosis, and precise tie to preceding intermittent cough before acute phase. Covers ~85-90% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like eczema [P-22 implied], cat allergy [P-27], vaping [P-36/37], symptoms [P-2,3,19,47] verifiable in transcript. Hallucinations include specific vaping chemicals (propylene glycol, etc.), nicotine, particulate matter (plausible but not stated); assumes 'intermittent exposure to cats' (no exposure mentioned, roommate but no cat); 'knowledge graph' undefined/unverifiable. Some plausible extras but multiple unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and comprehensively addresses how the three specified factors (eczema, cat allergy, marijuana vaping) collectively contribute to chronic/recurrent respiratory susceptibility, with structured breakdown and symptom ties; no off-topic content."
