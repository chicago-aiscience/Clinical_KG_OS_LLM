  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It claims no diagnostic tests were ordered, when the Gold Answer clearly shows a chest X-ray and COVID swab were ordered [D-37]. It states no self-isolation instructions were given, when explicit instructions to 'stay away from everyone, so including your wife' and 'try to self isolate as much as possible' were provided [D-37]. It claims no timeline was mentioned, when '24 to 48 hours' was stated [D-37]. The only correct element is that a physical exam was planned [D-38].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover most key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) chest X-ray ordered, (2) COVID swab ordered, (3) detailed self-isolation instructions including staying away from wife, (4) 24-48 hour timeline for results, (5) public health nurse follow-up plan, (6) disposition criteria based on test results. It only captures the physical examination component, covering approximately 15% of the key information.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts information clearly present in the transcript. At [D-37], the doctor explicitly states 'do a chest X Ray' and 'a covid swab' - yet the answer claims no tests were ordered. The same statement contains clear self-isolation instructions and timeline, which the answer incorrectly denies exist. This represents significant hallucination through omission and misrepresentation of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address all components of the question (diagnostic tests, physical exam, self-isolation, timeline, admission criteria), it does so by incorrectly claiming most information is absent from the transcript. The structure is relevant to the question, but the content fails to provide the actual information requested, making it only partially relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates critical failures across all evaluation dimensions. It incorrectly claims that diagnostic tests, self-isolation instructions, and result timelines were not provided, when all of these are explicitly stated in [D-37] of the transcript. The answer only correctly identifies the physical examination component. With a 1.25 average score, this response is largely inaccurate and incomplete, missing or contradicting approximately 85% of the key management plan elements documented in the Gold Answer."
