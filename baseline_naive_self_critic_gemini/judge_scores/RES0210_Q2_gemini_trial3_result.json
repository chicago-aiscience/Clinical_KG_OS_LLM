  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies both medications mentioned in the transcript: Lipitor for high cholesterol and Tylenol for symptom relief (cough/general wellness). It accurately identifies the effectiveness reported by the patient ('helps a little bit'). It correctly quotes the transcript, including a likely typo in the source ('haven't taken' for 'have taken'), maintaining consistency with the provided text.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all parts of the prompt: names of prescribed/OTC medications, conditions, and effectiveness. Compared to the Gold Answer, it misses the generic names (atorvastatin, acetaminophen) and the explicit confirmation that no other medications were mentioned. It also excludes the non-medication measure (clearing gunk) and other negative findings (no allergies, no recent cannabis), though these were not explicitly requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is perfectly faithful to the transcript. It provides specific citations ([P-25], [P-14], etc.) that correspond correctly to the information provided. There is no hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and strictly follows the user's question, avoiding the extra-textual clinical details (allergies, social history) found in the Gold Answer that were not requested."
