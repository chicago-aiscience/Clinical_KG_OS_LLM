  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, accurately names the COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and correctly states the 24-48 hour turnaround time. All facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key components of the question: (1) alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), (2) specific test (COVID swab), and (3) turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, it lacks the additional context provided in the Gold Answer about symptom overlap details (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) that explained why COVID was considered. This represents approximately 90% completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in [D-52]. The citations are accurate and the information is properly grounded. There is no hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question with focused, relevant information. The bullet-point format enhances clarity and relevance by organizing the response around the specific questions asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-cited response that correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All information is properly grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. The response loses only minor points for completeness by not elaborating on which specific symptoms overlapped between COPD exacerbation and COVID-19, though this additional context was present in the Gold Answer. The organized format and direct addressing of all question components make this a high-quality response."
