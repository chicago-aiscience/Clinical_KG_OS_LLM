These symptoms align with the knowledge graph, which identifies loss of taste and dry cough as indicators of the diagnosis \"covid\" ([SYMPTOM] loss of taste, [SYMPTOM] dry cough).\n\nThe doctor notes that the symptoms are \"consistent with some common covid symptoms\" [D-39], leading to a plan for testing.
