  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate in all claims made: red spots in sputum (P-4), right-sided chest pain worsening with cough/deep breath (P-17, P-19), fever/off feeling (P-5), chills (P-9). No contradictions or errors compared to Gold Answer or transcript; all consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: cough history (missed), sputum yellow custard + red spots (only red spots covered), chest pain right/constant/dull/always there/worse cough/deep (only right + worse cough/deep covered), fevers subjective Monday/felt hot/no measure/ongoing (only brief fever/off covered), chills (covered), dyspnea (missed), sore throat (missed), runny nose (missed), no weight loss (missed). Covers ~40-50% of key points (partial sputum, partial chest, partial fever, full chills).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in cited transcript segments (P-4,5,9,17,19); no hallucinations or unverifiable details; grounded entirely in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around the question's specifics (sputum, chest pain location/quality, systemic fever/chills); no off-topic content."
