  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states patient tried no treatments or OTC meds [D-9, P-9] and no regular medications [D-24, P-24]; Generated correctly notes no self-treatment indicated. Gold specifies no medication prescribed, only diagnostic COVID test (swab) [D-39], results in 1-2 days, self-isolation instructions [D-39], possible other tests and consult [D-40]. Generated accurately covers no self-treatment, COVID swab test [D-39], and detailed isolation instructions [D-39], but omits results timeline, other tests, supervising doctor consult, and explicit no regular meds. Minor addition of 'Knowledge Graph' and implied diagnosis introduces slight discrepancy, but core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: no self-treatments/OTC [D-9,P-9], no regular meds [D-24,P-24], no med prescribed, COVID swab test [D-39], results 1-2 days [D-39], self-isolate until results + potentially longer [D-39], possible other tests/consult [D-40]. Generated covers: no self-treatment, COVID swab test, full isolation instructions. Missed: specific no OTC/regular meds citations, results timeline, other tests, consult. Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims verifiable: no self-treatment per [P-9] (implied), symptoms [P-1], test/swab and isolation details exactly [D-39]. Citations accurate. Unverifiable: 'Knowledge Graph' reference and associating with 'covid diagnosis' (transcript has suspicion/test only, no confirmed diagnosis), but plausible and minor; no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses question with sections on patient's self-treatment (none) and doctor's recommendations (test + instructions), perfectly matching query structure and content without off-topic digressions beyond minor Knowledge Graph note."
