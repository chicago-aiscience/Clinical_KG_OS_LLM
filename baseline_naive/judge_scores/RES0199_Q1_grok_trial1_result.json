  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors by claiming that key specifics are not described in the transcript, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript: cough is 'mostly dry' [P-12], diarrhea 'five or six times a day' [P-28], vomiting 'two times' [P-32], headache 'probably like 7' [P-8]. It only vaguely notes onsets from [P-1] but denies other core facts present in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers: cough and headache started 4 days ago, mentions diarrhea/vomiting/nausea exist. Missed: cough dry/no sputum/blood/stable; no SOB/wheeze/chest pain; diarrhea 2 days/liquid/5-6x/day/no blood; nausea today/vomit yesterday 2x/food contents/no blood; GI negatives (no bloating/gas/constipation/appetite change); headache persistent/bilateral forehead/top/7/10/no radiation/neck stiffness/unusual; loss of smell/fatigue. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like 'nature of cough not described' unverifiable/false (P-12 dry), diarrhea frequency 'not specified' (P-28), vomiting 'not specified' (P-32), headache 'no severity rating' (P-8) are contradicted by transcript. Relies only on [P-1], ignores detailed later exchanges; multiple misrepresentations of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by categorizing respiratory (cough), GI (diarrhea/nausea/vomiting), and specifics (headache severity, diarrhea freq, vomit num, cough nature), though inadequately; no off-topic content."
