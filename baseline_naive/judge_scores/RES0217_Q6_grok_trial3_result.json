  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the tick laboratory identification and prophylactic antibiotics, aligning with Gold [D-6, D-13, D-18]. However, it omits blood work for Lyme titres/serology [D-18], planned physician consultation [D-13, D-22], and preventive advice on ticks in long grass/woods-fields, waving legs, and insecticide for garden [D-18]. It incorrectly states 'did not provide specific preventive advice' contradicting D-18. It expands physical exam to include ruling out systemic symptoms (e.g., joint pain, fever, headache), but these were assessed verbally [D-7, D-8, D-19], not as part of the 'quick physical exam' [D-18]. Mentions 'knowledge graph,' absent from transcript. Significant factual errors and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) quick physical exam [covered]; (2) tick to lab for species ID [covered]; (3) blood work/serology [missed]; (4) prophylactic antibiotics with reasons (>72h, geography) [partially covered]; (5) physician consultation [missed]; (6) preventive advice (habitat, waving legs, insecticide) [missed and denied]. Covers 3/6 (~50%) key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Tick lab verifiable [D-6, D-18]; physical exam planned [D-18, implied D-22]; antibiotics [D-6, D-13, D-18]. But hallucinated 'knowledge graph'; expanded physical exam scope to systemic symptoms not verifiable as physical (verbal history [D-7-D-20]); falsely claims no preventive advice despite explicit details [D-18: 'ticks like to live in long grass... insecticide out there']. Multiple hallucinations and inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response around diagnostic procedures, therapeutic interventions, and preventive advice, mirroring question's requested components (tests, treatments, consultation, preventive). Minor extraneous details like 'knowledge graph' and expanded exam, but no major off-topic content."
