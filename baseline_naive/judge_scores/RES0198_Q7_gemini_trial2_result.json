  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several major factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify which symptom appeared first, whereas [P-3] explicitly states it 'felt pretty stuffy at first.' It claims there was no shift in predominance, contradicting [P-3], which says 'but now it's mostly running.' Finally, it concludes the symptoms were intermittent, ignoring the patient's direct clarification in [P-8] that symptoms were 'pretty constant for the past week.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the key points regarding the progression from stuffiness to runny nose. It misses the specific detail about the first symptom and the patient's clarification regarding the constant nature of the symptoms. It also omits the mention of over-the-counter medications influencing the symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer shows poor faithfulness to the transcript. It claims information is missing when it is present [P-3]. It also hallucinates the meaning of [P-15], attributing 'a little bit' to the consistency of discharge when that response was actually regarding fatigue. It ignores the definitive statement in [P-8] about symptoms being constant.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in terms of structure, as it attempts to address each part of the prompt (onset, order, change, and frequency). However, because the information provided is factually incorrect, the utility of the response is low."
