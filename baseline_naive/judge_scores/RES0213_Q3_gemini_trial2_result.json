  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as anxiety/stress-induced chest pain, which is perfectly aligned with the gold answer. The reasoning provided regarding the patient's history, the situational triggers (studying/walking), and the patient's own suspicion is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers about 60-70% of the key points. It successfully addresses the history of anxiety, situational triggers, and current academic stress. however, it misses two major points from the gold answer: 1) the specific physiological reactions during episodes (breathing faster and nervousness [P-19]) and 2) the extensive list of pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, no asthma, no palpitations) used to rule out cardiac/pulmonary causes.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript, but it hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' and 'clinical documentation' as source materials, citing specific relationship tags (e.g., [PROCEDURE] studying) that are not present in the provided transcript. The facts themselves (studying causing pain) are in the transcript, but the attribution to an external graph is a hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the question about the diagnosis and the specific clinical observations that support it without including significant off-topic information."
