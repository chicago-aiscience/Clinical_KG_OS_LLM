  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All items stated in the Generated Answer are consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer: sudden shortness of breath [P-1], seizure last night [P-8], and self-measured temperature 37.4 [P-5]. No incorrect or contradictory facts are introduced. Minor omission of units (°C) does not make the stated value incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) sudden-onset shortness of breath; (2) cough beginning suddenly that morning and described as dry/no sputum; (3) seizure last night and underlying epilepsy; (4) objective fever measurement 37.4°C measured that morning. Generated Answer covers (1), (3) partially (seizure but not underlying epilepsy or post-seizure status), and (4) partially (value but not °C/that morning). It misses the cough entirely. Overall this is ~50–70% coverage of key requested elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate references ([P-1], [P-8], [P-5]). No hallucinated symptoms or measurements.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question (respiratory symptom(s), neurological symptom(s), and fever measurement) and contains no extraneous information. The main issue is omission (cough), not irrelevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, well-grounded, and focused, but incomplete because it omits the patient’s sudden-onset dry cough and additional neurological context (epilepsy/post-seizure status), and it does not specify units/timing for the temperature."
