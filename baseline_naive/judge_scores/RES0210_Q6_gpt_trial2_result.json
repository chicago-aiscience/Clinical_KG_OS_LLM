  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is not factually consistent with the Gold Answer on multiple key items. It incorrectly states the doctor’s end-of-visit plan is not available because the transcript “do[es] not contain the doctor's dialogue,” but [D-43] explicitly contains the doctor’s plan to review with the supervising physician and return. It also incorrectly claims there were no explicit alleviating factors; the patient clearly states that bringing up sputum helps “for a little while” [P-13] and that Tylenol “helps a little bit” [P-14]. It additionally misreads [P-16] (runny nose) as “back pain” resolving, which is a clear factual error. Aggravating factors of deep breathing and coughing worsening pain are correctly captured (supported by [P-18], [P-19]), and exertion avoidance is correctly noted, but the major errors substantially reduce accuracy vs the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missing: (1) the stated plan to discuss with supervising physician and return [D-43] is omitted/denied; (2) Tylenol as self-care and its partial benefit [P-14] is omitted; (3) expectorating sputum as a relieving factor [P-13] is omitted; (4) explicit mention that physical exertion (stairs) worsens symptoms/windedness [P-10, P-11] is not clearly listed as an aggravating factor (only avoidance is mentioned); (5) “no other triggers” when asked [P-12] is not included; (6) resting as alleviating factor (implicit in taking it easy) is only partially addressed. Only a subset (deep breathing/cough worsening pain; some exertion avoidance) is covered.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or are misattributed: claiming the transcript lacks doctor dialogue is contradicted by [D-43]; stating no explicit alleviating factors is contradicted by [P-13] and [P-14]; and the reference to “back pain… gone away” is fabricated/misread from [P-16] (runny nose). The remaining points about deep breathing/coughing aggravation are grounded. Overall, there are multiple unfaithful elements.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address all parts of the question (plan, self-care tried/effect, aggravating/alleviating factors). However, parts are inaccurate and it includes an irrelevant/incorrect tangent about “back pain.” Still, the structure is largely aligned with what was asked."
