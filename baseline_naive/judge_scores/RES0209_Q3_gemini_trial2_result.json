  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually correct based on the transcript but fails to include 'chest tightness' as one of the symptoms, despite the prompt specifically asking for it. It also characterizes the bronchodilator use as simply 'using it a lot' rather than providing the specific frequency change (once every two weeks to five/six times per week) mentioned in both the transcript and the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several critical points from the Gold Answer: 1) It omits the 'chest tightness' symptom. 2) it provides vague descriptions of medication frequency instead of the specific numbers requested/available. 3) Most importantly, it completely fails to address the 'rather than a new respiratory condition' part of the question, which the Gold Answer addresses by detailing the clinician's negative screening for infections (no fever, no sick contacts, no travel, etc.).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is faithful to the transcript for the parts it does include. It correctly identifies the patient's age of diagnosis and family history from the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but incomplete. It fails to address one of the four specific symptoms listed in the prompt's 'specifically' clause (chest tightness) and does not provide the supporting evidence for why this isn't a *new* condition, which was a core component of the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a basic summary of asthma symptoms but fails to include specific symptoms and frequency data requested in the prompt, and it ignores the differential diagnosis logic (excluding new conditions) found in the Gold Answer."
