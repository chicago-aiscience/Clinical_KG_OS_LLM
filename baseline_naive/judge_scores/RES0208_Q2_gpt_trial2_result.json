  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two current medications (Avodart and Tums), links Avodart to enlarged prostate/BPH, and links Tums to reflux. It also accurately states the patient stopped his prior reflux medication because dietary changes/identifying trigger foods controlled symptoms. No contradictions with the Gold Answer. The only minor issue is specifying Tums as “calcium carbonate,” which is true but not explicitly stated in the transcript/Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key items asked: (1) current meds, (2) indication for each, and (3) what reflux med change was made and why. Minor omission relative to Gold Answer details: it does not explicitly state Tums is used “here and there”/as-needed, and it does not mention the doctor’s positive response or the denial of allergies (not required by the question).",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by the transcript. The only slight ungrounded detail is naming the active ingredient of Tums (calcium carbonate), which is not mentioned in the transcript (though it is generally accurate). Otherwise, medication names, indications, and the reason for stopping the prior reflux medication are explicitly present.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question about current medications, their indications, and the patient’s independent change to his reflux regimen with rationale. No irrelevant tangents."
