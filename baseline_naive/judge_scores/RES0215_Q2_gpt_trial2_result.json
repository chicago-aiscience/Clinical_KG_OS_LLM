  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the child sometimes uses OTC Reactine/OTC allergy meds for seasonal allergies (matches [P-36]) and that there are no prescribed medications (matches [P-36], also consistent with [P-46]-[P-47]). However, it adds an unsupported justification (“supported by the knowledge graph”) that is not in the transcript, and it does not explicitly state that nothing is given for the wheezing/SOB episodes (a key medication-management fact in the Gold Answer). Overall, the included facts are largely accurate but slightly incomplete and with a minor unsupported statement.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) No treatment given for current wheezing/SOB episodes; resolves with rest ([P-33]-[P-34]) — MISSING. (2) Only medication use is occasional OTC antihistamines/Reactine for seasonal allergies ([P-35]-[P-36]) — COVERED. (3) No prescribed medications; no regular meds ([P-36], [P-46]-[P-47]) — PARTIALLY covered (mentions no prescribed meds, but not the repeated ‘no meds/no regular meds’ confirmations). (4) Prior viral infections did not require antibiotics ([P-16]) — MISSING. Overall coverage is partial (~50–79%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (Reactine/OTC use for seasonal allergies; no prescribed meds). The reference to a “knowledge graph” is not present in the transcript and is therefore an ungrounded addition. Aside from that minor hallucinated element, the answer is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments used for the respiratory episodes and other conditions and whether any prescribed medication is involved. No notable tangents."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and relevant, correctly identifying only intermittent OTC Reactine for allergies and no prescriptions, but it omits key details about no treatment for the wheezing episodes and no antibiotic use, and includes a minor ungrounded ‘knowledge graph’ reference."
