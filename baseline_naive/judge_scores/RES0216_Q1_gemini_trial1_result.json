  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain information regarding fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, cough, anxiety, or sweating, even though these were explicitly denied by the patient in turns P-6, P-11, P-12, P-13, P-14, and P-15. It also incorrectly claims the transcript lacks reports of upper airway symptoms, missing the hoarseness, phlegm, and throat clearing mentioned in P-11.",
    "completeness": "The response covers less than 50% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It misses the upper airway symptoms (hoarseness, phlegm) and fails to list nearly all the denied symptoms requested by the prompt (except for chest pain). It also includes 'headache' as a symptom present during the visit, which the Gold Answer excludes as the patient only mentions taking Tylenol for headaches 'not very often' rather than as a current complaint.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript in its assertions of missing data. Claiming that the transcript 'does not contain information' regarding the denied symptoms is a 'negative hallucination' or failure of extraction, as that information is clearly present in turns 5 through 15.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it fails to provide the specific information requested in the prompt. The prompt explicitly asked which of the 'commonly screened symptoms' (fevers, night sweats, etc.) were denied; the generated answer simply dismissed these as unavailable."
