  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the source transcript and Gold Answer. It accurately identifies the lab tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG), imaging (X-ray), and therapeutics (steroids, antibiotics, oxygen, bronchodilators).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two points included in the Gold Answer: the instruction for ongoing blood pressure monitoring (mentioned in D-37) and the specific timeframe for the COVID-19 swab results (24-48 hours). It also categorizes the COVID swab as a monitoring procedure rather than a lab test, though this is a minor organizational difference.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely faithful to the transcript. All points are grounded in the dialogue, specifically citing D-52, D-37, and P-11 correctly.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses each component of the question (labs, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutics) without adding unnecessary information."
