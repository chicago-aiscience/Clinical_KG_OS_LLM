    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the medication (Keppra) and the chronic condition (epilepsy). It also correctly notes that the patient forgot the dose. There are no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the 'specific circumstance' part of the question adequately. While it mentions the patient forgot, it completely misses the details about the daughter's birthday celebration and the change in the usual dinner routine, which are explicitly detailed in the Gold Answer and the source transcript [P-24].",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is fully supported by the transcript. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question asked, although the response to the second part of the query is overly brief and lacks the specific details requested."
