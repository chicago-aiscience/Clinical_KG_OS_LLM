  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect. It claims that only patient dialogue (P-1 through P-23) is provided and that doctor's responses are absent, which is factually wrong. The transcript clearly contains doctor's dialogue labeled [D-1] through [D-48]. The Gold Answer correctly references [D-47] and [D-48] where the doctor provides a summary assessment and states the plan. The Generated Answer's core premise that 'it is not possible to answer' due to missing doctor dialogue contradicts the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address any of the three required components: (1) doctor's stated plan, (2) summary assessment conveyed to patient, and (3) information guiding next steps. The Gold Answer comprehensively covers all three elements from [D-47] and [D-48]. The Generated Answer provides irrelevant patient history details instead of answering the question. Coverage is 0% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error/hallucination by claiming doctor dialogue is absent when it clearly exists throughout the transcript ([D-1] through [D-48]). The claim about 'one month' cough duration contradicts the transcript where the patient says 'three months' [P-2]. The 'knowledge graph assessment' appears fabricated as no such structured knowledge graph exists in the source material. Multiple hallucinated claims undermine faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. Instead of identifying the doctor's plan, assessment, and guidance for next steps, it incorrectly claims the information doesn't exist and provides tangential patient history. The question specifically asks about what the doctor stated at the end of the consultation, which is directly available in [D-47] and [D-48]. The response is off-topic and fails to engage with the actual question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally flawed and receives the lowest possible scores across all dimensions. It incorrectly claims that doctor dialogue is absent from the transcript when it is clearly present throughout ([D-1] through [D-48]), making its core premise factually wrong. It completely fails to answer any of the three components of the question regarding the doctor's plan, assessment, and guidance for next steps, all of which are explicitly stated in [D-47] and [D-48] of the source transcript. The answer contains hallucinated elements (knowledge graph references, incorrect symptom duration) and provides irrelevant patient history instead of the requested information. This represents a complete failure to accurately extract and report the clinical information requested."
