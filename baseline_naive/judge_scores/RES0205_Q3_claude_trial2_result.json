  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis and accurately states the test was negative. However, it provides less detail about the timeline and context compared to the Gold Answer. The core facts are accurate but less comprehensive.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main components requested: diagnosis investigated (COVID-19), evidence prompting investigation (persistent cough, hospital worker status), and test results (negative). However, it misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: the specific timeline of testing (two weeks ago at symptom onset), the social pressure from coworkers being scared, the patient staying home since testing, the flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose), the PPE use, and the patient's intention to return to work. Coverage is approximately 60-70% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The patient mentions being a hospital worker [P-34], having a persistent cough for two weeks [P-2], the dry cough nature [P-5], and the negative COVID test [P-35]. The answer does not hallucinate facts and properly cites transcript passages. However, it references a 'knowledge graph' that was not provided in the materials, which is a minor concern but doesn't affect the accuracy of the clinical content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated, what evidence prompted it, and what the testing revealed. It stays focused on the question without introducing irrelevant information. The structure clearly maps to the question's requirements."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis with accurate test results, and remains faithful to the transcript. However, it lacks the comprehensive detail of the Gold Answer, missing important contextual elements like the specific testing timeline, social workplace dynamics, flu-like symptoms, and the patient's work absence. While all included information is accurate and relevant, the answer could be more complete to fully capture the clinical scenario presented in the transcript."
