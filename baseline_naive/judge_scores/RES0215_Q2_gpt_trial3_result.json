  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the only medication used is occasional OTC Reactine/other OTC allergy meds for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications involved—these align with the transcript and Gold Answer (P-36, P-46, P-47). It does not introduce any clear contradictions. However, it adds an unsupported reference to a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript (minor factual/grounding issue rather than a clinical contradiction).",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: (1) occasional OTC Reactine/OTC meds, (2) for seasonal allergies, (3) no prescribed medications.\nMissed key points from Gold Answer: (1) mother gives nothing for the current wheezing/SOB episodes and they resolve with rest (P-33, P-34), (2) explicitly that she has no regular medications aside from occasional Reactine (P-46, P-47), and (3) prior viral infections did not require antibiotics (P-16). Overall, it captures the allergy medication/no-prescription aspect but omits several Gold Answer details about management of respiratory episodes and antibiotics.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript (P-36). The statement about a “knowledge graph” supporting the conclusion is not grounded in the provided transcript and constitutes a minor hallucinated justification. Otherwise, the medication claims are faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments and whether prescribed medication is part of management, which directly answers the question. It does not add major irrelevant content."
