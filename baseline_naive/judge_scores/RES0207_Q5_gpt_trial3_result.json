  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies medication non-adherence as a contributor to the seizure (patient: “I kind of forgot to take my med” [P-9]; medication: Keppra [P-23]). However, it is factually incorrect about hereditary/family history: the transcript explicitly states epilepsy runs in the family and that the patient’s mother had epilepsy [P-26]. Therefore, the answer contradicts the source and the Gold Answer on a central point (hereditary risk/family history) and fails to relate maternal history to the patient’s underlying epilepsy diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) hereditary predisposition—epilepsy runs in family; mother affected [P-26]; (2) medication-related risk—missed Keppra dose [P-23] due to disrupted routine [P-24]; (3) patient links missed meds to seizure [P-9]; (4) seizures normally infrequent/well-controlled [P-9]; (5) explain how family history supports underlying epilepsy diagnosis [P-8, P-26]. Generated Answer includes only (2) and partially (3). It omits/denies (1) and (5), and does not include (4) or the disrupted-routine detail (P-24).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or directly contradict the transcript: it claims there are no hereditary risk factors and no family history information, despite explicit maternal epilepsy history [P-26]. It also references a “Knowledge Graph” [KG], which is not part of the provided transcript, introducing unverifiable content. The medication non-adherence and Keppra portions are supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on hereditary and medication-related risk factors and family history, which matches the question. However, it provides incorrect denials of family history/hereditary factors, reducing its practical relevance to answering the question accurately."
