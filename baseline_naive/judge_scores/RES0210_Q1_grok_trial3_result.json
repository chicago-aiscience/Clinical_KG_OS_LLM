  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the red spots in sputum from [P-4], right-sided chest pain from [P-17], worsening with coughing and deep breathing from [P-19], subjective fever and feeling off from [P-5], and chills from [P-9], all of which are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: worsening cough (Friday raspy, Sunday severe) - missed; sputum as yellow custard with red spots starting Sunday - partially covered (red spots only, misses yellow color/appearance and timing); right-sided chest pain constant/dull/always there even lying down, worse with cough/deep breath - partially covered (location and aggravating factors only, misses constant/dull quality); subjective fevers starting Monday felt hot no measured temp persisting - partially covered (mentions fever/off); chills last two days - covered; dyspnea on exertion, sore throat, runny nose resolved, no weight loss - all missed. Covers approximately 20-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the cited transcript segments: red spots/gunk [P-4], right pain [P-17], worse with cough/breath [P-19], fever/off [P-5], chills [P-9]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured precisely around the question's requested elements (sputum description, chest pain location/quality, systemic symptoms like fever/chills) with bullet points matching them directly, no off-topic content."
