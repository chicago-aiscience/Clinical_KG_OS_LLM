  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately details partial loss of smell (can detect very strong bad odors) and partial loss of taste (can taste very salty foods but not normal items like banana), plus mild dry cough with specifics like consistency, onset, non-productive nature. Generated Answer correctly notes reduced smell and mild dry cough from P-1 but incorrectly states taste as 'completely lost' (contradicts P-4's partial description), missing duration (two days), consistency, cough details (no sputum/blood, same onset, no triggers). Significant factual error on taste completeness.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3 symptoms for 2 days; smell partial (strong bad odors); taste partial (salty yes, banana no); both consistent; cough mild/dry/non-productive/consistent/same onset/no triggers. Generated covers basic symptoms and partial smell/mild cough but wrongly calls taste complete, misses all details/perceptions, duration, consistencies, cough nuances. Covers ~30% (symptoms listed, basic degrees).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites only P-1; smell 'not as well' verifiable as reduced; taste 'lost' in P-1 but P-4 explicitly 'not totally gone' for smell and partial for taste (salty yes) — 'completely lost' not verifiable and contradicted; cough mild dry verifiable. Medical terms (olfaction/gustation) plausible but not in transcript. Hallucinates completeness of taste loss.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly lists sensory (smell/taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms with degrees/severity, structured as bullet points matching question's focus on specifics and perceptions; no extraneous content."
