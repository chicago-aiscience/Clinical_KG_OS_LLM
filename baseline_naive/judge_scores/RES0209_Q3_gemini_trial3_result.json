  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding the symptoms it does list (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) and the patient's history. It accurately reflects that the bronchodilator helps and is being used more frequently.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. It fails to mention 'chest tightness,' which was explicitly requested in the question. More importantly, it misses the entire second half of the clinical logic: the exclusion of infectious symptoms (no fever, no sick contacts, no travel, etc.) which is what differentiates the 'worsening of asthma' from a 'new respiratory condition.' It also omits the specific metrics of bronchodilator increase (once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript and does not hallucinate. It correctly cites the diagnosis age and the family history found in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant but fails to address the specific list of symptoms provided in the prompt (omitting chest tightness) and does not fully answer the 'why' regarding the exclusion of a new condition."
