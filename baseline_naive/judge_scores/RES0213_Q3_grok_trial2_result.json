{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety as the core diagnosis, aligning with the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' Key supporting facts like situational triggers [P-4], history of anxiety [P-21], and patient consideration of stress [P-8] match the Gold. Minor discrepancies include a less specific diagnosis phrasing and addition of unverified 'Knowledge Graph' claims not in the Gold Answer, but core facts remain consistent without major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: situational pattern (partial, [P-4]; misses full resolution when distracted/social [P-9, P-29]), anxiety history [P-21, P-22 partial], stress linkage (implicit via academics, misses thesis details [P-15, P-16]), patient considers stress [P-8]. Missed: nervousness/breathing [P-19], detailed pertinent negatives (fevers, exertional, etc.). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like situational triggers [P-4], history [P-21], stress [P-8], analgesics [P-6] verifiable in transcript. However, multiple hallucinations: 'Knowledge Graph' references (not in transcript), psychosomatic pattern inference stretched; reading books [P-28] claimed to mitigate symptoms but actually for general stress management. Multiple unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by stating the diagnosis ('Anxiety') and listing supporting clinical observations with citations, though with some extraneous hallucinated elements; remains highly focused on the query."
