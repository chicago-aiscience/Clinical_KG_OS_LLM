  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several significant factual errors when compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. Most notably, it claims the transcript does not contain information regarding fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, cough, anxiety, or sweating, all of which were explicitly denied by the patient in turns P-6, P-11, P-12, P-13, P-14, and P-15. It also incorrectly states there were no upper airway symptoms, missing the patient's report of hoarseness, phlegm, and throat clearing (P-11). It includes 'headache' as a reported symptom for the visit, whereas the patient only mentioned taking Tylenol for occasional headaches in general (P-27).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is highly incomplete. It missed almost all the 'explicitly denied' symptoms requested by the prompt (7 out of 8 items). It also failed to mention the diffuse nature of the chest tightness ('all over') and the specific upper airway symptoms identified in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It explicitly claims that information is missing from the text segment when that information is clearly present. This is a form of negative hallucination/omission that contradicts the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant in its structure, directly attempting to answer both parts of the prompt (reported and denied symptoms). However, the content provided within those sections is largely inaccurate or incomplete."
