  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient had a dry, non-productive cough, consistent with the transcript ([D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6]). It also correctly notes that the patient reported a runny nose ([D-11, P-11]). It does not introduce any facts that contradict the Gold Answer; the main issue is omission rather than incorrect statements.",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer include: (1) cough duration ~4–5 days, (2) dry cough, (3) explicitly non-productive/no sputum, (4) cough stayed the same, (5) runny nose duration past couple of days, (6) nasal discharge described as pretty clear. The Generated Answer covers (2) and (3) for cough and identifies the runny nose, but omits cough duration and stability, omits runny-nose duration, and does not state the discharge was clear (it only says it was being assessed). Overall coverage is about half of the key details.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript. The answer does not hallucinate additional symptoms or characteristics; it simply paraphrases what was asked/confirmed in the dialogue and stays within the provided content.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and the cough’s productive vs. non-productive nature, which directly addresses the question. However, it fails to provide the actual appearance/quality of the nasal discharge (clear), so it only partially answers what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and grounded in the transcript but is only moderately complete because it omits key symptom characteristics, especially the clear nasal discharge and symptom durations/course."
