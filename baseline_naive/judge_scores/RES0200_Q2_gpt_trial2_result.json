  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory inhalers (Ventolin and Spiriva). However, it contains major factual errors relative to the Gold Answer/transcript: (1) it states no non-respiratory meds were mentioned, but the patient clearly reports taking atorvastatin (“Torva Staten”) [P-38]; (2) it states no quantitative Ventolin frequency is provided, but the patient reports ~10 uses in the past week [P-12]; (3) it states there is no information that the patient discontinued any medication, but the patient explicitly stopped a blood pressure diuretic without physician approval [P-35, P-36]. These are significant contradictions to the key asked elements.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: Ventolin and Spiriva as existing inhalers. Key points missed: (a) Ventolin use quantified as ~10 times in the past week; (b) atorvastatin as a non-respiratory medication; (c) previously prescribed diuretic for blood pressure; (d) that the patient discontinued the diuretic on their own without doctor approval. Overall, only a minority of required items are captured.",
    "faithfulness": "While the answer does not invent extra medications, it repeatedly claims that the transcript lacks information that is actually explicitly present (Ventolin frequency, atorvastatin, self-discontinuation of a diuretic). These incorrect negations indicate poor grounding in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question domains (current meds, Ventolin usage, and discontinued med), with only minor unnecessary mention of steroids/antibiotics in the acute plan. Despite inaccuracies, it is topically aligned with the question."

  "summary": "The answer is on-topic but misses or contradicts multiple explicit transcript facts (Ventolin ~10 uses/week, atorvastatin use, and self-discontinued diuretic), resulting in low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness."
