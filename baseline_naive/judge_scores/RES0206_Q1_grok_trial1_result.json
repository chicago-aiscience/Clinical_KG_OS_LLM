  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists respiratory symptoms: increased cough [P-1], increased green-yellow sputum [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], worsened dyspnea [P-1], reduced exercise tolerance [P-4]. Systemic: possible fever [P-9-11], sinus pressure [P-12], mild headache [P-14]. Most bothersome: cough [P-12]. Generated covers all respiratory except explicitly missing reduced exercise tolerance (though dyspnea is related), covers fever and sinus pressure but misses headache, incorrectly includes high blood pressure as a systemic symptom of acute worsening (it's a chronic condition mentioned in [P-22], not acute). Citations accurate. Minor discrepancies with addition of non-acute symptom and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: increased cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea [P-1]; fever [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12], most bothersome cough [P-12]. Missed: reduced exercise tolerance [P-4], headache [P-14]. Extra: high BP (not acute). Covers ~80% of key points (8/10 considering details).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: dyspnea/cough/sputum/hemoptysis [P-1], fever [P-9], sinus [P-12], high BP [P-22], cough most bothersome [P-12]. No hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer into respiratory/systemic symptoms and most bothersome, perfectly matching question focus; minor inclusion of chronic high BP does not detract significantly."
