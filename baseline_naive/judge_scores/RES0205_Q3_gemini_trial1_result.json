  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is entirely accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis, the negative test result, and the primary reasons for the investigation (persistent cough and hospital employment).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the main pillars but omits several supporting details present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it misses the mention of initial symptoms like sore throat and runny nose as evidence, the social pressure from coworkers being 'scared' at work, and the specific timing of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the provided transcript. The citations [P-2, P-5, P-35] are accurate and correctly attributed to the patient's statements.",
    "relevance": "The response is perfectly focused on the question asked, providing a clear breakdown of the diagnosis, the evidence, and the testing outcome without any irrelevant information."
