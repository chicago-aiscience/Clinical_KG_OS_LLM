  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It claims that information about triggers is absent and that there is no evidence the doctor suspected undiagnosed allergies. However, the transcript explicitly lists exercise, cold, and pollen as triggers (P-9, P-11) and shows the doctor specifically asking about and agreeing with the suspicion of allergies (D-12, D-13).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses almost all key points regarding the triggers and their relation to the clinician's suspicion of allergies. It also omits the specific change in inhaler frequency (from once every two weeks to 5-6 times a week) mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is missing from the source when it is clearly present. It also states the doctor's focus was solely on infectious causes, ignoring the dialogue about allergies in D-12 and D-13.",
    "relevance": "The answer fails to directly address the question's core components (the triggers and allergy suspicion) by erroneously stating the transcript does not provide this information. While it discusses symptoms and family history, it ignores the primary focus of the prompt."
