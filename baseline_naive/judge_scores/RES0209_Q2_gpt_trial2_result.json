  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient uses a bronchodilator for asthma. However, it is factually incorrect in two major ways: (1) it claims the transcript does not specify the administration method, but the patient confirms it is a “puffer” (i.e., inhaler) (D-7/P-7); and (2) it claims the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication, but the clinician explicitly asks about a medication taken “every day no matter what” (D-5) and the patient says they do not have it (P-5). These are significant contradictions to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: identifies bronchodilator/rescue medication. Key points missed/incorrect: as-needed use framing (D-4/P-4), administration via puffer/inhaler (D-7/P-7), explicit denial of daily controller medication (D-5/P-5), and denial of any other meds (D-6/P-6; D-30/P-30). Overall, it captures only a minority of required elements and misstates others.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer introduces non-transcript elements (\"knowledge graph\" and a [TREATMENT] tag) that are not present in the source. It also asserts absence of information that is actually present (puffer/inhaler; daily medication question). This reflects multiple ungrounded or misleading claims relative to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to answer all parts of the question (current medication, administration, and missing daily controller) and stays mostly on-topic, but provides incorrect denials about what is in the transcript and includes an irrelevant reference to a “knowledge graph.”"

  "summary": "While it correctly notes bronchodilator use, the response wrongly denies key transcript details (puffer/inhaler and the doctor’s daily-controller question) and adds non-transcript “knowledge graph” content, leading to low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness."
