  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer details specific inquiries by the doctor post [P-38] on living situation (D-45/P-45/D-46/P-46), sick contacts (D-47/P-47), workplace (D-48/P-48/D-50/P-50), travel (D-49/P-49), and substance use, concluding no clear source found. Generated Answer falsely claims no systematic exploration occurred, ignoring these transcript sections and contradicting Gold Answer entirely. No facts align; it's a complete factual reversal.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: timing after [P-38]; living situation details and environmental triggers; sick contacts; workplace specifics and sick colleagues; travel history; substance use screening; no clear source. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead asserting no exploration happened and focusing only on [D-52] COVID discussion.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims 'did not systematically explore' living, workplace, travel, sick contacts, but transcript verifies: living D-45/46 P-45/46; sick contacts D-47 P-47; workplace D-48/50 P-48/50; travel D-49 P-49. Only cites [D-52] accurately but ignores prior history-taking. Claims 'specific questions...were not asked' is hallucinated; multiple fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly responds to the question by stating what was (not) explored, with no off-topic content or tangents, focusing precisely on exposure sources inquiry (albeit incorrectly)."
