  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that no specific individual or source was identified in the social history, whereas the Gold Answer correctly identifies the nephew attending daycare as a potential source (P-11). It also incorrectly claims the doctor factored the patient's diabetes into the decision for a COVID swab and isolation, while the Gold Answer notes the doctor never explicitly linked the two in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses the most specific detail from the social history (the nephew). It fails to mention that the patient's nephew lives with them and attends daycare, which is the primary exposure risk mentioned in the Gold Answer. It also misses the doctor's lack of explicit connection between diabetes and the current illness.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the doctor's reasoning, claiming the doctor ordered the swab and isolation 'due to the patient's status as a diabetic.' The transcript (D-39) shows the doctor recommends these steps because of the 'pandemic' environment, regardless of the diabetes diagnosis. It also incorrectly claims no specific individual was identified as an exposure source.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in that it attempts to address both the exposure source and the chronic condition, but it misses the specific evidence required by the prompt regarding the social history."
