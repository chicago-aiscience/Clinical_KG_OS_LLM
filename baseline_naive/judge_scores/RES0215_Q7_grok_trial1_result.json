  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core timeline (4-5 days onset), initial trigger (playing tag), basic initial symptoms (wheezy, SOB, difficulty breathing), cough emergence, and nocturnal episode, aligning with Gold. However, it inaccurately describes the fluctuating pattern by linking to past infections 'come and go' (P-15, not current episode) and 'slightly' severity (P-32 misapplied), whereas Gold emphasizes episodic recurrence with activity/rest (P-6). Nocturnal episode wrongly stated as 'during the visit' (not in transcript/Gold). Initial symptoms cite P-1 instead of precise P-2. Cough lacks non-productive detail. Some factual errors but main points mostly correct vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers: onset/timeline (100%), trigger (100%), initial symptoms (roughly, wheezing/SOB/deep breaths), fluctuating pattern (basic 'fluctuating' but misses detailed episodic activity/rest resolution from P-6), cough emergence (basic, misses 'after wheezing' implication and non-productive), nocturnal (basic, misses full wheeziness detail). Misses pertinent negatives (no fever, fine otherwise). Pertinent negatives partially via no cyanosis. Covers ~60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Onset [P-1], trigger [P-3], initial symptoms [P-1/P-2 ok], cough [P-1], nocturnal [P-44] verifiable. Fluctuating [P-5] verifiable, but 'past infections come/go' (P-15) wrongly applied to current; 'slightly severity' (P-32) stretched/misused; no cyanosis [P-32] ok but for wrong inference. 'During the visit' for nocturnal hallucinated—not in transcript (one past night). Multiple misattributions/hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question elements: onset, trigger, fluctuating pattern, cough emergence, nocturnal episode. No off-topic content, directly addresses clinical question focus."
