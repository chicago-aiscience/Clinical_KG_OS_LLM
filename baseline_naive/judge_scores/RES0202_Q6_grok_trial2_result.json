  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the doctor's plan from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation (including sister), false negative possibility, alternative viral illness if negative, and exact warning signs (high temperature, seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). Minor discrepancies include not explicitly quoting the assessment as 'viral infectious process consistent with COVID-19' or 'sounds like an infection' (though implied via 'symptoms consistent with COVID-19'), omitting the asthma differential note from [D-45], and not mentioning no medications/watchful waiting, but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab/test and TAT (100%), isolation period and sister (100%), false negatives (100%), alternative diagnosis if negative (100%), warning signs with examples (100%). Partially covered: assessment as COVID-like viral infection (implied but not fully phrased); missed: asthma consideration if no fever [D-45], no medications/watchful waiting. Covers ~85-90% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-44]: swab/24-48hrs, isolation 14 days incl sister, false neg, another viral illness, specific warnings (high temp, neuro/seizures, weak/dizzy, fainting). Citation [D-44] accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details; minor rephrasing (e.g., 'patient' for parent) but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around exact requested elements (assessment/plan, test/TAT, isolation, alt dx/false neg, warnings w/examples) using focused bullets with no tangents or off-topic content."
