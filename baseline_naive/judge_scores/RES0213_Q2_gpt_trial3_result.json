  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all OTC products the patient tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and accurately reports the stated lack of benefit (“hasn’t really helped very much”). It also correctly reports the patient’s only routine supplement as a multivitamin and accurately notes the patient runs a few times per week.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core Gold Answer items: (1) Tylenol, (2) Advil, (3) Alka-Seltzer, (4) these were ineffective, and (5) daily multivitamin as the only regular supplement. It partially omits Gold Answer context that the patient takes no other medications (no prescriptions) and does not include the additional non-medication details mentioned in the Gold Answer (leisure reading for stress, smoking reduction).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript: OTC trials and limited effect (P-6), multivitamin (P-25), and running frequency (P-28). No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on OTC medications/supplements and effectiveness, which directly answers the question. Mentioning running is slightly tangential but consistent with the Gold Answer’s additional context."
