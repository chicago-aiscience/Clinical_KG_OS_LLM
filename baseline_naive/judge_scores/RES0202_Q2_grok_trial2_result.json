  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: COVID swab [D-44], results in 24-48 hours [D-44], 14-day isolation including from younger sister [D-44], and specific ER triggers (high temperature, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting [D-44]) match exactly with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab test with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation specifically from younger sister, ER precautions for high temperature/neurological symptoms/weakness/dizziness/fainting. Missed: full household composition (parents and sister [P-35]), false-negative possibility and alternative viral illness, no medications/supportive observational approach/wait for results, mother's acknowledgment of viral care [P-41], school test requirement [P-41]. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims (COVID swab, 14-day isolation from sister, results timing, ER symptoms) are directly verifiable in [D-44] of the transcript with accurate citations; no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by focusing on diagnostic test (COVID swab), isolation instructions/duration (14 days), and specific household isolation target (younger sister), with ER instructions as relevant management; structured response with no tangents or off-topic content."
