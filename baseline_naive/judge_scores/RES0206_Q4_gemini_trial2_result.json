  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19) and the test ordered (COVID swab). However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain details about social contacts, which is factually wrong as the transcript explicitly mentions a sick friend during dog walks.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses one of the three key components of the question: the specific detail about social contacts (the sick friend). It covers the condition and the test but fails the final requirement.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer claims information is missing from the transcript (social contact details) when it is clearly present in turn [P-20]. This is a significant error in groundedness/extraction.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the first two parts of the question directly. For the third part, it provides irrelevant clinical symptoms (fever, sputum) instead of the requested social contact details, though it attempts to explain why it did so."
