  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer and transcript for the points it covers. It correctly identifies the seizure event on the evening before, the missed medication, the morning onset of shortness of breath, the temperature check of 37.4°C, and the decision to seek care.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer. It omits the context of the daughter's birthday celebration and disrupted dinner routine as the reason for missing the medication. It also fails to mention the dry cough (P-4), the specific timeline estimate of three hours (P-11), and the clinical context that the patient had never experienced shortness of breath like this before (P-3). These omissions significantly reduce the depth of the timeline compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All information provided (seizure, missed Keppra, morning SOB, temp check) is directly supported by the patient's statements in the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question by providing a reconstructed timeline of clinical events in a structured format."
