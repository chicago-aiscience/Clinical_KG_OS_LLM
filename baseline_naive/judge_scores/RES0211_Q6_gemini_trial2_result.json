  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies the clinical findings from the 'summary at the end of the visit.' Instead of using turn D-58 (the actual summary), it pulls from earlier turns (D-2, D-7, D-9). It lists 'night sweats' as a finding, which was not included in the doctor's recap. Most importantly, it incorrectly identifies Jessica's primary goal as 'concluding the appointment without further inquiries,' whereas the Gold Answer and transcript (P-60) state her goal was to know if she needed medicine.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer: the 3-4 day duration, the dry cough (the main complaint), the lack of sputum, the contact history (brother), the negative asthma history, and the current medications. It also fails to capture the goal of symptom relief/medication and the desire to rest.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misattributes symptoms discussed early in the visit to the 'recap' at the end. It also claims 'night sweats' were a confirmed specific symptom, whereas in turn P-9, the patient simply states she feels hot all the time, not necessarily the specific 'soaking sheets' night sweats the doctor asked about. It also misinterprets the patient's lack of further questions as her primary goal for the visit.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question but fails to follow the specific constraint of looking at the 'doctor's summary at the end of the visit.' By focusing on the wrong section of the transcript, the content provided is mostly irrelevant to the specific question asked."
