  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer: suspicion driven by triad—loss of smell + loss of taste + dry cough; physician explicitly ties symptoms to COVID in D-39 and orders a swab test. Generated Answer incorrectly lists only loss of taste + dry cough, omitting loss of smell (a key symptom emphasized by both patient P-1 and doctor’s summary D-16). It correctly states the doctor connected symptoms to COVID in D-39 and ordered a swab test. It does not incorporate the gold answer’s additional supporting context (absence of fever/SOB/etc., ‘otherwise pretty well,’ and isolation advice), but those are more completeness than factual errors. Minor issue: it mentions a “knowledge graph provided,” which is not in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covers: loss of taste, dry cough, doctor’s statement that symptoms are consistent with COVID, and that a swab test was ordered.\nMisses key Gold Answer points: loss of smell as part of the symptom combination; doctor’s summary that patient is otherwise well; systematic negatives (no fever, no dyspnea, no sore throat, no chest pain); rationale that narrow symptom profile supported testing; self-isolation instructions while awaiting results.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are supported (P-1 for sensory loss and cough; D-39 for COVID consistency and swab). However, the answer omits loss of smell despite it being present in P-1 (a content selection error) and introduces an unverifiable detail (“knowledge graph provided”). Otherwise it stays close to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question about which symptoms led to COVID suspicion and what test was ordered, with a brief explanation of the linkage. Limited by missing one of the key symptoms and not explaining the broader clinical reasoning noted in the Gold Answer."
