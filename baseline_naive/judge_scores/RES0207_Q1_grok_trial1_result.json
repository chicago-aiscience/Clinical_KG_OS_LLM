  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the sudden shortness of breath [P-1], seizure last night [P-8], and fever measurement of 37.4 [P-5], which match the transcript and Gold Answer facts without contradictions. However, it omits the dry cough as a key respiratory symptom detailed in the Gold Answer [D-2, P-2, D-4, P-4], epilepsy diagnosis [P-8], additional timings, and fever characterization as mild Celsius, representing minor discrepancies while keeping core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: sudden shortness of breath [P-1] (partial), seizure previous night [P-8] (partial), fever value 37.4 [P-5] (partial). Missed: dry cough onset and nature [D-2,P-2,D-4,P-4], SOB timing ~3 hours [P-11], epilepsy/seizure disorder [P-8], fine after seizure [P-8], fever as mild Celsius with morning confirmation [P-5,D-6,P-6], all pertinent negatives. Covers approximately 20-49% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (SOB [P-1], seizure [P-8], 37.4 [P-5]) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly lists the requested respiratory symptom (SOB), neurological symptom (seizure), and fever measurement in a structured, focused format with no off-topic content."
