  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary diagnosis to rule out per [D-52] and lists key symptoms (headache, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) from [P-1] that overlap with COVID, matching the Gold Answer's emphasis on these initial symptoms; it also accurately flags loss of smell as characteristic per [P-24]. Minor discrepancies include omitting specifics like 'dry cough,' 'persistent headache,' fatigue, and pertinent negatives, and slightly overstating that [D-52] highlights loss of smell (doctor notes overlap generally, but loss of smell was elicited earlier). Core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Covers: doctor's suspicion and 'overlap' phrasing [D-52], specific symptoms (headache, cough, GI issues matching P-1), loss of smell as characteristic [P-24], reference to alternative viral illness [D-52]. Missed: full symptom list (dry cough detail [P-12], fatigue [P-19], doctor's targeted smell/taste question [D-24]), pertinent negatives (no fever [P-18], no runny nose [P-23], no aches [P-27]). Covers ~60-70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims grounded: symptoms from [P-1]/[P-12], anosmia from [P-24], suspicion from [D-52]. Minor issue: claims doctor 'highlighting the loss of smell as a specific factor' tied to [D-52], but [D-52] doesn't mention anosmia (it was reported earlier [P-24], and plausible as doctor inquired specifically [D-24]); no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both question parts: specifies symptom combination leading to COVID suspicion and identifies anosmia as distinguishing symptom vs. other virals, with no off-topic content."
