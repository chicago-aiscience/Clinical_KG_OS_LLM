  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the timing of the COVID test relative to symptom onset. However, in [P-36], the patient explicitly states, 'I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.' This is a significant factual error compared to the Gold Answer and the source text.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to provide the timing of the test (stating it's unavailable); 2) It misses the patient's specific role as a hospital clerk [P-34]; 3) It misses the patient's concern regarding returning to work and the pressure to stop coughing before doing so [P-36]. It only captures the point about coworkers being scared.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the timing is not explicitly specified is unfaithful to the transcript, as [P-36] contains this exact information. This is a negative hallucination (denying the presence of information that exists).",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure, addressing all parts of the multi-part question, although the content within those sections is inaccurate or incomplete."
