  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Raspy cough onset Friday: matches Gold Answer/transcript [P-3].\n- Worsening Sunday with red spots in sputum: consistent with Gold (blood-tinged sputum starts Sunday) [P-4].\n- Fever onset Monday: essentially correct, but the best supporting line is [P-8] (patient explicitly states Monday); the Generated Answer cites [P-5], which is less precise.\n- Chills timing: Generated Answer infers “last two days” as Monday–Tuesday. With consultation on Wednesday, “last two days” more accurately maps to Tuesday–Wednesday (Gold Answer) [P-9]. This is a meaningful day-shift error.\n- Right-sided chest pain onset: Generated Answer implies onset on Wednesday. Transcript indicates he has pain and he “specially notice over the last day” [P-20], suggesting onset around Tuesday (Gold Answer). Another meaningful day-shift error.\n- Yellow sputum: Generated Answer does not clearly state that yellow sputum began Sunday simultaneously with the red spots (Gold Answer) [P-6, P-7].\n- Adds some interpretive language (e.g., “systemic infection”) not stated in transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key elements from Gold Answer:\n- ✅ Consultation day Wednesday.\n- ✅ Raspy cough began Friday.\n- ◐ Sunday worsening: includes red spots, but omits/under-specifies that yellow sputum began the same day and that cough became “really bad.”\n- ◐ Fever Monday and persisted to Wednesday: mentions onset but not persistence to Wednesday.\n- ❌ Chills: included but incorrect day attribution (should be Tue–Wed).\n- ❌ Chest pain: included but incorrect onset (should be ~Tuesday) and does not clearly note it is constant/dull.\n- ❌ Misses the “about a week ago” runny nose that resolved.\n- ✅ Mentions exertional windedness and pleuritic worsening with deep breaths/coughing (though onset not requested).",
    "faithfulness": "- Most quoted symptoms are present in the transcript (raspy cough [P-3], red spots [P-4], fever [P-5]/[P-8], chills [P-9], right chest pain [P-17], worse with deep breath/cough [P-18, P-19], winded [P-10]).\n- However, it introduces “knowledge graph” relationships that are not part of the provided transcript and uses them as justification.\n- Several timeline inferences conflict with transcript context (chills and chest pain onset), reducing faithfulness to the source despite being plausible clinically.",
    "relevance": "- The response is largely focused on the requested timeline and progression.\n- Minor irrelevant content: references to an external “knowledge graph” and broader diagnostic framing (e.g., “systemic infection”) that are not asked for."

  "summary": "The answer captures the general progression (Friday cough → Sunday blood-tinged sputum → Monday fever → later chills/chest pain) but has important day-specific inaccuracies (chills and chest pain onset), omits key details (yellow sputum simultaneous onset, resolved runny nose), and adds non-transcript “knowledge graph” content."
