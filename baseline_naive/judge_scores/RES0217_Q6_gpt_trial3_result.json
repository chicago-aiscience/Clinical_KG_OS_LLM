  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly captures several elements of the plan: sending the tick for lab identification (supported by D-6/D-18), doing a physical exam of the bite site (D-18), and starting prophylactic antibiotics due to likely prolonged attachment >72 hours (D-6) and local risk (D-13).\n\nHowever, it contains a major factual error: it states the doctor “did not provide specific preventive advice” regarding the garden/outdoor environment. In fact, the doctor explicitly advised that ticks live in long grass/wood–field edges and suggested looking for them and possibly using insecticide (D-18).\n\nIt also overstates/reshapes the purpose/content of the physical exam (e.g., “rule out systemic symptoms such as joint pain, fever, or headache”); those were primarily asked about in history, and the plan was simply a “quick physical exam” (D-18).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key plan components:\n1) Quick physical exam (D-18) — Covered.\n2) Send tick to local lab for species ID (D-6, D-18) — Covered.\n3) Blood work for Lyme titres/serology (D-18) — Missed.\n4) Prophylactic antibiotics/“moving forward with antibiotics” (D-6, D-13, D-18) — Covered (but without the Strathroy/geographic-risk rationale).\n5) Planned consultation with/confirmation by physician (D-13, D-22) — Missed.\n6) Preventive advice about ticks in long grass/edge habitats + consider insecticide (D-18) — Not only missed, but explicitly denied.\n\nOverall, it includes ~3 of 6 major components and omits/incorrectly reports the rest.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded in the transcript (tick sent to lab; antibiotics; planned physical exam). However, the answer is not fully faithful because it directly contradicts the transcript by claiming no garden/outdoor preventive advice was given (where D-18 clearly contains such advice). It also introduces an extraneous phrase (“as detailed in the knowledge graph”) that is not present in the transcript. Citations for the physical-exam description are somewhat mismatched (the explicit plan is in D-18).",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the requested elements (diagnostics, treatment, prevention), but it fails to address two asked-for components (planned physician consultation and blood work) and gives an incorrect statement about prevention. Still, it remains mostly on-topic without major tangents."
