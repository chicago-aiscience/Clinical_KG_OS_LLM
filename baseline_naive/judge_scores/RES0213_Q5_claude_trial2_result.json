  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three main factors (family history, smoking, psychosocial stressors) and their connections to the patient's concern. All citations are accurate. The description of the father's heart attack timing ('last year'), age ('50s'), and the patient's explicit fear ('scares me') are correctly represented. Smoking details (5 cigarettes currently, 10 previously, starting at 18) and psychosocial stressors (Masters thesis, deadline pressure, living alone) are accurately presented. The answer correctly notes the patient's acknowledgment that symptoms might be stress-related.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: father's heart attack in his 50s, patient's explicit fear and connection to symptoms, complete smoking history with timeline, psychosocial stressors including thesis deadline and living situation, and the patient's recognition of possible stress connection. It also includes the anxiety attack history and how symptoms correlate with being alone/studying. The paternal grandfather detail is present. The answer goes beyond by adding medication trial information and symptom patterns, which enriches but doesn't contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The patient's statement 'I was kind of worried that it could be a heart thing' [P-8] is correctly quoted. Father's heart attack details from [P-8, P-30] are accurate. Smoking history from [P-13, P-14, P-18] is correctly presented. Psychosocial stressors from [P-15, P-16, P-26, P-27, P-28] are accurately described. The connection between symptoms and activities (studying, walking alone) is supported by [P-4, P-9, P-29]. The anxiety connection is properly cited from [P-19, P-22]. No hallucinated content detected.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three components of the question: family history contribution, smoking history contribution, and psychosocial stressors' contribution to heart disease concern. It explicitly discusses how these factors interact through a 'feedback loop of anxiety' and provides specific consultation details illustrating each connection. The structure mirrors the question's framework. Some additional context about medication trials and symptom patterns is relevant to understanding the patient's concern, though not explicitly requested."

  "summary": "This is an exemplary response that fully addresses all components of the question with complete accuracy. It correctly identifies and explains how the three factors (family history, smoking, psychosocial stressors) contribute to and interact with the patient's heart disease concern. All facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and properly supported by transcript citations. The answer covers 100% of key points including: father's heart attack details, explicit patient fears, complete smoking history, psychosocial stressors (thesis pressure, living alone), and the patient's recognition of stress connection. All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations and no hallucinations. The response is perfectly focused on the question, with additional context that enriches understanding without being tangential. The synthesis section effectively explains the interaction between factors as a 'feedback loop of anxiety.'"
