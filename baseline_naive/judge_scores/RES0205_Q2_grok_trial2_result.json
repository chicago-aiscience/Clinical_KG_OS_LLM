  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states no current prescribed medications overall (implied across sections), details acid reflux management via dietary avoidance of acidic foods and chocolates with reported improvement [P-25], matching Gold. Anxiety: correctly notes no current treatment [P-22]; misses but does not contradict past medication stopped 2-3 years ago [P-24]. Cough: accurately notes no current meds and patient request [P-35], though Gold specifies no prescription yet due to pending exam [D-37]. Adds COVID test negative [P-35], factual but not emphasized in Gold. Omits hay fever [P-27]. No contradictions; minor omissions/discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: no prescribed meds [P-23]; past anxiety med [P-24]; reflux dietary only/specifics [P-22/25]; no reflux med; hay fever no treatment [P-27]; cough no med prescribed yet [P-35/D-37]; zero meds summary. Generated covers: reflux fully; anxiety no current; cough no meds/inquiry; implies no meds overall. Misses: past anxiety detail, hay fever, explicit no prescription for cough/pending exam, summary phrasing. Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: reflux/anxiety [P-22/25]; cough details [P-2/5/15/35]; COVID test [P-35]. No unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by detailing current medication/treatment status across conditions (reflux, anxiety, cough), specifies reflux management and no prescribed meds. Cough details relevant to treatment status; COVID section contextually relevant to cough evaluation."
