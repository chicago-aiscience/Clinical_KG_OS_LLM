  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies hereditary risk (epilepsy runs in family, mother had it [P-26]) and medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose due to daughter's birthday [P-23, P-24, P-9]) as key factors contributing to the seizure, linking family history directly to patient's epilepsy diagnosis. Generated Answer correctly notes medication non-adherence with citations [P-9, P-23] but fabricates that no hereditary risks or family history exist, directly contradicting transcript [P-26] and Gold Answer; also hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' not present in source. Significant factual errors on core elements.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) hereditary predisposition via family history (mom's epilepsy [P-26]); (2) medication non-adherence (Keppra missed due to birthday routine change [P-23,P-24]); (3) infrequent seizures when adherent [P-9]; (4) family history relates to patient's diagnosis. Generated covers only basic medication non-adherence (~25% coverage), misses all hereditary/family points and details like reason for missing dose/context of control.",
    "faithfulness": "Medication claims verifiable [P-9,P-23]; however, 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' unverifiable/not in transcript (hallucination); hereditary/family claims ('does not specify', 'no information') fabricate absence of explicit transcript evidence [P-26,D-26], denying verifiable facts—multiple hallucinations by omission/denial.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around medication/hereditary risks and family history per question, but fails to address hereditary/family aspects accurately, making it partially relevant with off-topic denials."
