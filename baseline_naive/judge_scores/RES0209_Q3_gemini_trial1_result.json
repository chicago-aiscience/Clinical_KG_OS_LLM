  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and consistent with the transcript. It accurately identifies the patient's history of asthma and the current symptoms. However, it mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is not present in the provided context, though it uses this to support correct medical associations.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. It omits 'chest tightness' from the symptom list despite it being in the prompt and transcript. It fails to quantify the increase in bronchodilator use (1x/2weeks to 5-6x/week). Most importantly, it completely ignores the clinician's screening for infectious etiologies (denial of fever, sick contacts, travel, etc.), which is the primary evidence used to rule out a 'new respiratory condition' as requested by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript, correctly citing sections like [P-1] and [P-15]. The mention of a 'knowledge graph' is a minor hallucination of external tools/data structures not provided in the prompt, but it does not lead to incorrect clinical claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question but focuses primarily on the presence of asthma symptoms rather than the differential diagnosis aspect (ruling out other conditions) which was a significant part of the question's 'rather than' clause."
