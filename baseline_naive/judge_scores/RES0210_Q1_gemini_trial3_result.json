  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with both the transcript and the Gold Answer. It accurately identifies the blood spots in the sputum, the location of the chest pain, the aggravating factors for the pain, and the presence of fevers and chills. There are no false statements.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer and specifically requested in the prompt. It omits the color of the sputum ('yellow custard'), the quality of the chest pain ('dull' and 'constant'), the progression of the cough (from raspy to severe), and other reported symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion, sore throat, and the history of a runny nose. It covers approximately 45% of the key points mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is entirely faithful to the source transcript. Every symptom listed is documented in the dialogue (e.g., P-4, P-17, P-19, P-5, P-9). No hallucinations were found.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, focusing directly on the symptoms requested in the prompt. It does not contain extraneous information, although it mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the provided context."
