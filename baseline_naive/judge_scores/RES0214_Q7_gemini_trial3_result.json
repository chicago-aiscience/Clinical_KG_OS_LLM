  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the patient's symptoms (stuffy nose, sore throat, fever, muscle aches). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the husband's timeline. It states that the 'specific duration or exact timeline of when the husband's symptoms began is not provided,' whereas the Gold Answer and transcript [P-19] explicitly state the husband had symptoms for the 'past week.'",
    "completeness": "The response covers the chronological progression of the patient's symptoms well. However, it fails to provide the comparison to the husband's onset, which was a specific requirement of the prompt. By claiming the information is missing, it misses a key point of the Gold Answer (the 4-day lead time of the husband's illness).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a lack of information. It claims the transcript does not provide the husband's symptom duration, but turn [P-19] clearly states he had been experiencing symptoms for a week. This is a failure of faithfulness to the provided source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question (the patient's progression and the husband's comparison), although the information provided for the second part is factually incorrect."
