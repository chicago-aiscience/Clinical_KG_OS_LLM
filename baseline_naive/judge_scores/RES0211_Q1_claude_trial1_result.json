  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several significant factual errors. Most critically, it incorrectly states the doctor asked about 'spitting up sputum' at D-33 and Jessica responded 'No' at P-29 - these citation numbers refer to completely different exchanges about eczema and asthma. The actual sputum denial occurs at P-5/P-6. It also fabricates a night sweats confirmation ('sheets are soaked') when Jessica actually gave a qualified response at P-9. It incorrectly claims the transcript doesn't show inquiries about nausea, joint pain, or rashes when these are clearly present at D-11, D-13, and D-10 respectively. The core reported symptoms are mostly correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses approximately 40% of key information from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, feeling hot, and malaise. However, it completely fails to document Jessica's explicit denials of: nausea and vomiting (P-11), diarrhea (P-12), joint aches (P-13), new skin changes/rashes (P-10), and difficulty breathing from allergies (P-18). It also adds irrelevant information about post-nasal drip which wasn't part of the question's scope.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains multiple instances of fabricated content and incorrect citations. The most egregious is citing D-33/P-29 for sputum discussion when these actually discuss eczema and asthma. It mischaracterizes Jessica's night sweats response as a confirmation when she gave a more nuanced answer. The claim that the transcript doesn't show inquiries about nausea, joint pain, or rashes is demonstrably false. While some claims are grounded in the transcript, the citation errors and misrepresentations significantly undermine faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the core question about reported and denied symptoms, maintaining reasonable focus throughout. However, it includes some tangential information (post-nasal drip, general malaise characterization) and provides an unnecessary lengthy note claiming certain symptoms weren't asked about when they actually were. The structure is appropriate but the content relevance is diminished by the factual errors and omissions."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates moderate relevance and partial completeness but suffers from significant correctness and faithfulness issues. Critical errors include fabricated citations (D-33/P-29 for sputum discussion), incorrect claims that nausea/joint pain/rashes weren't asked about when they clearly were (D-11, D-13, D-10), and mischaracterization of Jessica's responses. The answer correctly identifies core reported symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, feeling hot) but completely omits Jessica's denials of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, joint aches, rashes, and breathing difficulty. The multiple citation errors and fabricated claims seriously undermine the answer's reliability despite addressing the question's general intent."
