  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the clinical rationale (the 'why') behind the doctor's screening questions for weight loss, travel, sick contacts, and chemical exposure, aligning well with the Gold Answer's list of differential diagnoses (Malignancy, TB, Legionella, Occupational Lung Disease). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the patient's responses. It repeatedly claims that the patient 'did not provide a response' to these questions, whereas the transcript contains clear answers for all four (P-22, P-23, P-24, and P-34).",
    "completeness": "The answer fails the second half of the prompt's requirement: explaining how the responses narrowed or maintained the differential. Because the model incorrectly believed the answers were missing, it concluded the differential remained 'wide/open,' which directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the transcript facts.",
    "faithfulness": "This is a significant hallucination of omission. The transcript explicitly provides the patient's answers: 'No' for weight loss, 'Sarnia' for travel, 'Nope' for sick contacts, and a denial of direct exposure for chemicals. Claiming these responses were not provided is a direct contradiction of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each part of the prompt. However, the relevance of the content is severely undermined by the factual inaccuracies regarding the transcript's contents."
