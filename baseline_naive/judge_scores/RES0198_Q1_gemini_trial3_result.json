  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy and runny nose) and the character of the discharge (mostly clear). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the denied symptoms. The gold answer and transcript clearly show the patient denied coughing [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat [P-7], and loss of taste/smell [P-16], whereas the generated answer claims no such denials occurred.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the first two parts of the question (nasal symptoms and discharge character) but fails significantly on the third part. It misses all the 'denied' symptoms which were a primary component of the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant hallucination by stating that the transcript does not contain denials for sore throat, cough, post-nasal drip, or loss of taste/smell. These denials are explicitly present in the text at points P-4, P-6, P-7, and P-16.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in that it attempts to address all parts of the question directly, though it provides incorrect information for the final part."
