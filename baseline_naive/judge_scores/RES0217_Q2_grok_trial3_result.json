  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient's current statin therapy (citing P-15, consistent with Gold's P-15), past antibiotics for prior tick bite (P-3, matches Gold), and proposed prophylactic antibiotics due to >72-hour attachment (D-6, aligns with Gold's D-6, D-13, D-18). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer; all stated facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: current statin [P-15]; past antibiotics [P-3]; new prophylactic antibiotics proposed with reasoning (>72h) [D-6]. Missed: cholesterol management context [P-14]; no allergies [P-16, P-17]; no specific antibiotic details but plan to consult physician [D-13, D-22]; environmental prevention with insecticide [D-18]. Covers ~60-70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: statin [P-15]; prophylactic antibiotics and 72h rationale [D-6]; past antibiotics and rash [P-3]; hiking/gardening exposure inferred accurately from context. Citations correct, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly addresses the question by structuring response around current statin, proposed prophylactic antibiotics for tick bite, and related past history; no off-topic content."
