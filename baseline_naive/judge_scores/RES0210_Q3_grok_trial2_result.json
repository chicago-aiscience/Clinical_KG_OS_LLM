  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures core facts like productive cough with red spots [P-4], fever [P-5/P-8], chills [P-9], exertional dyspnea [P-10], and right-sided pleuritic chest pain worsening with deep breaths/coughing [P-17-P-19], consistent with Gold. Minor discrepancies include omitting the specific 'yellow custard' sputum description [P-6] and smoking history [P-37-P-38] as a risk factor, but no contradictions or errors in presented facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) yellow sputum + red spots [P-4,P-6] - covered red spots but missed yellow; 2) fever [P-8] + chills [P-9] - fully covered; 3) exertional dyspnea [P-10,P-11] - fully covered; 4) detailed pleuritic pain (constant, dull, worsens with breath/cough, even at rest) [P-17-P-21] - mostly covered (right side, worsens with breath/cough) but misses constant/dull/rest details; 5) smoking risk - missed. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: cough [P-1], red spots/'gunk' [P-4], fever [P-5], chills [P-9], dyspnea [P-10], pain location/worsening [P-17,P-19]. Citations accurate to transcript content; no hallucinations, interpretations (e.g., hemoptysis, pleuritic) plausible and grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing specific transcript findings (productive cough, systemic signs, dyspnea) pointing to pneumonia and explaining pleuritic pain's role in supporting lower tract involvement with transcript citations; no off-topic content."
