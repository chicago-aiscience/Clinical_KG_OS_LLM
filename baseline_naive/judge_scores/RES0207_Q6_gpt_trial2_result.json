  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states the doctor said they would review the information with the doctor working that day, then return shortly to discuss next steps, including possible tests and how to move forward (D-37–D-38). The Generated Answer instead claims the next steps “cannot be determined” and incorrectly asserts the transcript ends at P-23. This directly contradicts the transcript content and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed: (1) doctor will go over the case with the doctor working today; (2) another physician will be involved in decision-making; (3) doctor will come back shortly; (4) possible tests may be ordered; (5) plan to decide how to move forward; (6) no specific tests/treatments named yet; (7) patient acknowledged; (8) courteous closing. The Generated Answer covers essentially none of these, aside from vaguely stating no plan is available.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the provided transcript: the Generated Answer claims the transcript ends at P-23 and that there are no subsequent doctor turns, but the transcript clearly includes D-24 through D-38, including D-37 outlining next steps. This is a major unfaithfulness to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at answering the question about next steps and follow-up, but it mainly argues (incorrectly) that the needed information is not present and adds a partial clinical summary. It remains mostly on-topic despite being incorrect."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely incorrect and unfaithful to the transcript because it wrongly claims the consultation ends before the doctor outlines next steps, omitting nearly all key elements described in the Gold Answer."
