  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains factual information from the transcript but is incomplete and lacks important details present in the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies red-spotted sputum, right-sided chest pain that worsens with coughing and deep breathing, fever, and chills. However, it misses critical details: the yellow custard appearance of sputum, the timing of symptom onset (raspy cough Friday, worsening Sunday), that pain is constant/dull and present even at rest, the specific timeline of fever (Monday onset, persisting through visit), throat soreness, resolved runny nose, dyspnea on exertion, and pertinent negative of no weight loss. The answer is factually accurate for what it includes but significantly incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50% of the key information in the Gold Answer. It identifies the four main categories requested (sputum, chest pain location/quality, fever, chills) but provides minimal detail. Missing elements include: complete sputum description (yellow custard), temporal progression of symptoms, pain characteristics (constant, dull, present at rest), measured details about fever timeline, dyspnea on exertion, sore throat, runny nose history, and pertinent negative findings. The answer addresses the basic structure of the question but lacks the depth and completeness of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The red-spotted sputum is confirmed in [P-4], chest pain location in [P-17], pain aggravation in [P-19], fever in [P-5], feeling off in [P-5], and chills in [P-9]. The answer does not introduce any fabricated information or hallucinated details. However, the description is minimal and selective rather than comprehensive. The citations are accurate and the content is grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: sputum description, chest pain location and quality, and systemic symptoms (fever and chills). It stays focused on the requested information without introducing irrelevant content. However, the answer could be more thorough in addressing each component. The structure mirrors the question's organization, making it easy to identify which parts address which aspects of the query."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and well-grounded in the transcript, directly addressing all components of the question without irrelevant content. However, it provides only a basic outline of symptoms, missing approximately 50% of the detailed information present in the Gold Answer, including complete sputum characterization, temporal progression, pain characteristics at rest, specific fever timeline, dyspnea on exertion, and additional symptoms. While correct in what it states, the answer lacks the clinical depth and completeness needed for comprehensive documentation."
