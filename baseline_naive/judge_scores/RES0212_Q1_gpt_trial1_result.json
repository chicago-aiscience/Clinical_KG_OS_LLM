  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient had a bothersome cough, that it was associated with greenish sputum, and that she reported fatigue and sleep disruption from coughing at night.\n\nHowever, it contains a key internal contradiction/misstatement about pain: it notes the cough “kinda hurts” (which aligns with her statement that it hurts when coughing [P-3]) but then lists as an explicit denial that she had “chest pain or general pain associated with the cough,” citing [P-19]. This is inaccurate because she did report pain with coughing [P-3], and [P-19] is about lack of other body pain/tenderness, not chest pain. It also fails to describe the cough’s chronicity and change over time, which are central to the question’s “specific” respiratory symptom characterization.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that ARE covered: \n- Cough present and bothersome.\n- Productive sputum described as greenish/gross.\n- Fatigue.\n- Sleep disturbance due to cough.\n\nKey points MISSING (major omissions):\n- Duration ~3 months and intermittent/recurrent nature.\n- Initially dry cough; became productive only in last ~3 days.\n- No blood/hemoptysis.\n- No foul smell noticed.\n- Nightly awakening for ~last month (frequency/detail).\n- Subjective fever/feeling hot at night.\n- Exercise limitation.\n- Explicit denials: night sweats, weight loss/loose clothes, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, body pain/tenderness, and denial of sick contacts.\n\nOverall, it captures only a minority of required symptom characteristics and explicit denials.",
    "faithfulness": "Most included items (green sputum, fatigue, sleep disruption) are supported by the transcript. However, the “Symptoms Explicitly Denied: Chest Pain … stating ‘I don’t think it’s like I have like pain’ [P-19]” is not well grounded: chest pain questioning/answer is at [P-3], and the patient did report pain when coughing. The phrase “knowledge graph information provided” is also not supported by the transcript context. These issues reduce faithfulness but the answer is not largely fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic (respiratory symptoms, sputum characteristics, and denied symptoms). There is little irrelevant content, but it fails to address much of what the question asks (especially the explicit denials list), which limits practical relevance to the prompt."
