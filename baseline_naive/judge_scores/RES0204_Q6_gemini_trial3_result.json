  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with both the transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the two diagnostic tests (Chest X-ray and COVID swab), the intent to consult with a supervising physician, and the follow-up steps. There are no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the majority of the key points but omits the initial physical examination (listening to the lungs and heart) mentioned by the doctor in [D-1] as part of the immediate plan. It also omits the specific age-appropriate descriptions of the tests mentioned in the Gold Answer, though it captures the clinical essence of the plan well.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims, such as the reason for the COVID swab and the specific mention of 'Rollercoaster Tycoon', are directly supported by the text. No hallucinations were found.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, providing sections for the consultation, diagnostic tests, and follow-up steps."
