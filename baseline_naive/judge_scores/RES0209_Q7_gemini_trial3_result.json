  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript and the gold answer. However, it describes the asthma history as 'long-standing' for a 10-year-old diagnosed at age 8, which is slightly imprecise compared to the gold answer's clear 'two-year disease history'. It correctly identifies the two-week exacerbation and the transition from infrequent to frequent medication use.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several critical points mentioned in the gold answer and requested by the prompt: it omits the specific baseline frequency (once every two weeks) and the current frequency (5-6 times per week), the patient's current age (10), specific triggers (exercise, cold air, seasonal factors), nighttime symptoms (every other day), chest tightness, and the clinical nuance that wheezing occurs more frequently than medication use.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the provided transcript. The citations [P-1, P-2, P-15, D-14] are accurate and the information provided (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) reflects the patient's statements without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer addresses the question but fails to provide the specific detail requested in the prompt. Since the prompt explicitly mentions 'once every two weeks' and 'five to six times per week,' a relevant answer should incorporate these specific benchmarks to describe the 'evolution' as requested."
