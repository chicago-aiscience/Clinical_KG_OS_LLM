  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core assessment (asthma recurrence as top differential [D-35]) matching Gold, with minor discrepancies: presents it more definitively without 'in some capacity' or 'pending findings'; specifies 'salbutamol' for rescue puffer (plausible from [P-25] but patient distinguishes daily vs. rescue); omits consulting supervising physician and stepwise approach; adds irrelevant patient confirmation of salbutamol. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: assessment as top differential [D-35]; phys exam listening to lungs [D-35]; first-step rescue puffers trial on walks [D-35]; contingency to revisit if no help [D-35]. Missed/partial: 'in some capacity/pending findings'; full 'quick physical exam' and further investigations; patient lacks rescue [P-17/18]; explicit therapeutic trial; stepwise 'one thing at a time' [D-36]; consulting 'the doc' [D-35/37]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: assessment, phys exam, rescue puffers, contingency all directly from [D-35]; salbutamol from [P-25] plausible for rescue. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph indication... [KG]' not in transcript; phys exam 'requires' for diagnosis implied but not stated. Minor hallucination, mostly verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address question: overall assessment, phys exam components, first-step treatment, contingency approach; no off-topic content."
