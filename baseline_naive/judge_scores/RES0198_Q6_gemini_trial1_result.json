  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's description of the diagnosis, supportive care, test, and public health guidance. All clinical details provided are consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points, including the diagnosis, hydration, Tylenol cold, the COVID swab, the 48-hour window, and isolation instructions. It misses the specific detail that symptoms take 'a few weeks' to resolve and that the swab is to be done 'today', both of which were included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript, specifically referencing D-39 where the management plan is discussed. There are no hallucinations, although it uses external tags like [KG] which were not in the source but do not detract from the content's validity.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses each component of the question (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, and public health guidance)."
