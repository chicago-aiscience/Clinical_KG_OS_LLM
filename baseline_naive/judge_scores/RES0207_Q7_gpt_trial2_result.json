  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately places the seizure the night before, notes the patient felt fine afterward and went to bed, and correctly identifies morning onset of shortness of breath, the temperature check (37.4°C), and the decision to seek care. The statement that forgetting Keppra was “likely the cause” is a reasonable inference from the patient’s comment (“I think that might have”), but it is still slightly stronger wording than the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: seizure last night with recovery and sleep; missed antiseizure medication; morning sudden shortness of breath; temperature checked in the morning (37.4°C); decided to come in due to uncertainty. Key elements missed: daughter’s birthday celebration disrupting routine (context for missed dose); onset of dry cough in the morning; patient’s estimate that symptoms began ~3 hours before consultation; patient’s statement they’ve never felt SOB like this before; explicit mention of uncertainty about whether seizure and respiratory symptoms are related.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by transcript lines. Minor issues: introduction of “knowledge graph information” is not in the transcript; “likely the cause” of seizure is an inference rather than explicitly stated. No major hallucinated events or contradictory claims.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on reconstructing the timeline (seizure, respiratory symptom onset, temperature check, and care-seeking decision) without unrelated tangents."
