  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) and the list of denied symptoms (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing). However, it provides a factually incorrect explanation for the denials. It claims the patient 'effectively denied' them by omission in turn [P-1], whereas the transcript contains explicit 'No' responses to the doctor's specific questions later in the visit (turns P-5, P-7, P-8, P-10, P-24). The gold answer correctly identifies these explicit turns.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies all four symptoms and all five denied symptoms requested in the prompt. It captures the essential data points but misses the nuanced confirmation of swallowing ability mentioned in the gold answer (swallowing food/liquids).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails significantly in grounding. It attributes the denials to [P-1], claiming that not mentioning them in the initial turn constitutes an explicit denial when asked. In reality, the transcript contains actual explicit denials in response to direct questions, which the model ignored in favor of a hallucinated 'denial by omission' logic. Citing [P-1] for these denials is factually inaccurate relative to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the question, providing the two lists requested."
