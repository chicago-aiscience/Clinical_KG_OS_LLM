  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the Gold Answer by stating the patient 'did not identify a specific external event,' while the Gold Answer correctly identifies the hiking trip two weeks ago where 'some people kind of brushed by us' [P-18] as the specific potential exposure event. It focuses on symptoms instead of exposure, introducing factual errors regarding the patient's reported history.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: none fully, as it misses the hiking exposure [P-18, P-19], limited outings confirmed [D-38, P-38], denial of sick contacts [P-17], household [P-29], and connection of this limited exposure to COVID suspicion [D-39]. Instead covers unrelated symptom details [P-1] and doctor's general confirmation [D-39], covering <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about symptoms [P-1] and doctor's COVID confirmation/isolation [D-39] are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, the central claim that 'patient did not identify a specific external event' is not grounded and contradicted by [P-18] mentioning hiking and brushing by people as the only potential source, indicating hallucinated denial of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer partially addresses the suspected COVID diagnosis via symptoms but completely misses and denies the core question element of the 'specific potential exposure event,' instead substituting symptoms as the 'exposure/condition,' making it largely off-topic for the query's focus on exposure history."
