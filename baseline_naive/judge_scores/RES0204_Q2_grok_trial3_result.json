  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer confirms no medications and history, proposes chest X-ray (D-37, explained as internal picture D-39) and COVID swab (D-39) with rationale as protocol for anyone with symptoms, notes discomfort and reassurance. Generated Answer accurately lists both procedures with correct citations (D-37, D-39), paraphrases rationale correctly as testing 'anyone with these symptoms lately', and mentions nose swab insertion. No factual errors or contradictions; minor omissions in phrasing (e.g., 'attending' vs 'supervising', brief X-ray description) but core facts match fully.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) No meds/history (covered implicitly via question, not restated); 2) Chest X-ray proposed by supervising doc to look inside (covered, ~80%: mentions attending/physician, better look inside); 3) COVID swab rationale: institutional protocol for symptoms (fully covered with quote paraphrase); 4) Discomfort/nose stick/bravery (partially: nose swab mentioned); 5) Arrange and discuss next steps (missed). Covers core procedures and rationale (80-99%), misses elaborative details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Chest X-ray from D-37 ('might want to do a chest X Ray... better look'); COVID from D-39 ('do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone... stick something up your nose'). Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated content; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question: lists proposed procedures (both), provides specific rationale for COVID swab with quote. Structured bullets and rationale section; no off-topic content, perfectly focused."
