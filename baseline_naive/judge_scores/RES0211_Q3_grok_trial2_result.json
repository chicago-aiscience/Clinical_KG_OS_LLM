  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies and cites the key presenting symptoms (dry cough [P-1], scratchy throat [P-1/P-4], headache [P-1/P-2], subjective fever [P-7/P-9]) and absences (no sputum [P-5/P-6 implied], no GI symptoms [P-11/P-12], no joint pain [P-13]), matching Gold's core facts. It accurately links dry cough to upper airway irritation. However, it introduces a non-existent 'knowledge graph' and 'clinical knowledge base' with [INDICATE] relations, which are not in the transcript or Gold, creating minor discrepancies despite core consistency.",
    "completeness": "Covered: dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, subjective fever citations; dry/non-productive nature suggesting upper vs lower; absences of sputum, GI (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea), joint pain narrowing differential. Missed: 3-4 day timeline as typical URI progression [P-1/P-3]; initial symptom order (scratchy throat first [P-4]); malaise [P-14/D-15]; fatigue [P-13]; brother exposure [P-39]; doctor summary framing [D-58]. Covers ~70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom claims and citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-7/P-9]) verifiable in transcript. Absences verifiable [P-5/P-6, P-11/P-12, P-13]. Allergy context verifiable [P-15/P-18]. However, 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge base', [INDICATE] [DIAGNOSIS] phrases, and specific differentials (pneumonia sputum, arthritis/systemic viral joint pain, stomach flu GI) are not in transcript—hallucinated external knowledge presented as fact. Multiple hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how listed symptoms support URI diagnosis and how absences (sputum, GI, joint pain) narrow differential, with structured sections on correlation, exclusion, and summary perfectly focused on question—no off-topic content."
