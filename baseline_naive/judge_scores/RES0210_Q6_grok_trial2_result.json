  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript (limited to [P-1] to [P-42]) lacks the doctor's stated plan, but [D-43] explicitly states the plan to consult the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps, matching the Gold Answer. It misses Tylenol [P-14] and expectoration [P-13] as self-care, partially covers exertion avoidance [P-10] but misattributes effects. For aggravating factors, it covers coughing [P-19] and deep breathing [P-19] but omits exertion/stairs [P-10,P-11]; for alleviating, it wrongly denies explicit factors and misreads [P-16] runny nose as 'back pain.' Significant errors contradict Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: partial self-care (exertion avoidance [P-10]), aggravating (coughing [P-15,P-19], deep breathing [P-19]). Missed: doctor's full plan [D-43]; self-care Tylenol [P-14] and expectoration relief [P-13]; aggravating exertion [P-10,P-11]; alleviating Tylenol [P-14], expectoration [P-13], resting [P-10]; clinical management implications. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims doctor's plan absent despite [D-43] in transcript; accurate citations where used (e.g., [P-10],[P-19]) but hallucinates no alleviating factors (ignores [P-13,P-14]); misinterprets [P-16] as back pain (it's runny nose); multiple unverifiable absences and misreads.",
    "relevance": "Structures response directly around question components (doctor's plan, self-care, aggravating/alleviating factors); minor irrelevant tangent on runny nose as alleviating."
