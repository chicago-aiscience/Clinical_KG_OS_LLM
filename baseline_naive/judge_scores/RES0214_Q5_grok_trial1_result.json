  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer focuses on three epi factors: husband's week-long illness suggesting household transmission (cited P19-20, D51,53), limited outside contacts (work from home P23/42, staying home P22, hiking P18, no sick contacts P17), and no flu shot (P53, D53) making flu possible but COVID prioritized. Generated correctly identifies prioritization of COVID due to husband/household and flu as secondary due to no shot, with accurate quotes from D53/D54. Minor discrepancies: overstates symptoms as diagnostic of COVID via non-existent 'knowledge graph', and claims 'overwhelming evidence' for COVID not in Gold/transcript; core facts on epi factors align.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Husband's symptoms precede patient's, household transmission (D53 quote); 2) Specific limited contacts (WFH, homebound, hiking, no sick contacts); 3) No flu shot prompts flu differential (D54). Generated covers: husband illness/exposure (1), shared household implying limited contact (partial 2), no flu shot/influenza possibility (3), adds isolation. Misses specific details on contacts (hiking, WFH denial of sick contacts explicitly); covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript-grounded claims: husband similar illness (P19-20), household (P22,41-42), isolation advice (D53-54), COVID swab (D53), flu possibility/no shot (D53-54). Hallucinations: 'knowledge graph' indicating symptoms diagnose COVID (absent), symptoms as 'strongest indicator' or 'diagnosis' of COVID (doctor says 'possibility' to rule out, no diagnosis), 'overwhelming evidence' for COVID. Multiple hallucinated facts (knowledge graph, diagnostic certainty).",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how epi factors (husband, household, no flu shot) shape DDx: prioritizes COVID via household spread, keeps flu via no shot. Minor tangents on symptoms/knowledge graph but structured around factors and doctor's reasoning."
