  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately matches the Gold Answer’s timeline: cough begins Wednesday night after coming home well (P-1); cough persists and worsens Thursday with tiredness (P-1); Friday cough worsens further and fever appears for the first time >100°F with possible 100.1–101°F (P-1, P-2), along with decreased appetite and disinterest in breakfast (P-15, P-17). No contradictory or incorrect clinical claims are introduced.",
    "completeness": "It captures the key day-by-day evolution asked for (cough onset and worsening over 3 days; fever emergence Friday; fatigue and decreased appetite timing). However, compared with the Gold Answer it omits: (1) explicit mention that the illness duration was corrected to ~3 days rather than 5 (P-4), (2) the mild runny nose (P-16), (3) the parent’s suspicion of loss of taste (P-17), and (4) the explicit stepwise summary statement in P-12. These are supportive details; most core points are still covered.",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are directly supported by cited transcript segments (P-1, P-2, P-15, P-17). No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions are present.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question by providing a day-by-day progression from Wednesday evening through Friday, focusing on cough onset/severity and the emergence of fever, fatigue, and decreased appetite. No notable tangents."
