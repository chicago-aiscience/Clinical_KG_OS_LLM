  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: suspicion based on *three* symptoms—loss of smell, loss of taste, and dry cough—leading to COVID swab testing. Generated answer incorrectly states the combination was only loss of taste + dry cough, omitting loss of smell (a key symptom in P-1 and emphasized in Gold). It correctly notes that the doctor linked symptoms to COVID in D-39 and ordered a swab test.",
    "completeness": "Covers: loss of taste, dry cough, doctor’s statement that symptoms are consistent with COVID, and that a swab test was ordered. Misses: loss of smell (core), the doctor’s summary that the patient was otherwise well, the negative ROS elements (no fever, no dyspnea, etc.) that supported the narrow symptom profile, and the self-isolation guidance while awaiting results.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements about loss of taste, dry cough (P-1), doctor’s rationale ‘consistent with common covid symptoms’ (D-39), and ordering a swab (D-39) are supported by the transcript. However, the phrase ‘knowledge graph provided’ is not in the transcript, and the symptom-combination claim is incomplete relative to the transcript (loss of smell is clearly present).",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses what symptoms led to COVID suspicion and what test was ordered, with minimal extraneous content (aside from the brief ‘knowledge graph’ mention)."

  "summary": "The answer is relevant and mostly grounded in the transcript, but it is notably incomplete/partly incorrect because it omits loss of smell (a key symptom driving COVID suspicion) and several supporting contextual points present in the gold answer."
