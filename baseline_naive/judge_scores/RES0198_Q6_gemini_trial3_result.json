  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer regarding the diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), the specific supportive care (hydration and Tylenol Cold), the diagnostic test (swab for COVID-19), and the public health instructions (isolation and following public health guidance).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers almost all key points but misses the specific timeframe for symptom resolution ('a few weeks') and the specific timing of the test ('today'), both of which were included in the Gold Answer as part of the management plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript, specifically referencing [D-39]. There are some internal tags like [KG] which are likely model artifacts, but they do not introduce hallucinated clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, structured clearly to address each component of the question (Diagnosis, Supportive Care, Test, Public Health Guidance)."
