  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the initial symptom (stuffy nose) and the duration of the patient's fever. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating that the husband's symptom duration is not provided; P-19 explicitly mentions the husband has been symptomatic for 'the past week'. Additionally, it describes muscle aches as 'following' the fever, whereas the transcript (D-15, P-15) and Gold Answer establish they occurred around the same time (concurrently).",
    "completeness": "The response covers the patient's symptom progression but fails the second half of the prompt regarding the comparison to the husband's timeline. Because it missed the 'one week' detail from the transcript, it could not provide the chronological comparison (husband starting 4 days prior) requested in the prompt and present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails faithfulness regarding the husband's data. Claiming information is not in the transcript when it is clearly stated in P-19 constitutes a failure to ground the answer in the source text. The description of muscle aches as 'following' the fever is also slightly unfaithful to the 'around the same time' confirmation in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant in its structure, addressing each part of the prompt directly, even if the content regarding the husband is factually incorrect based on the source text."
