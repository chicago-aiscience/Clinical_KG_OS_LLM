  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the respiratory symptoms reported (wheezy, short of breath, slight cough, difficulty taking deep breaths, out of breath, hard time catching breath) matching the Gold Answer's coverage from [P-1], [P-2], [P-3], [P-32]. It correctly notes cough as recent ('now' [P-1]). However, for earliest symptoms when first started 4-5 days ago, Gold specifies both 'wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths' [P-2], while Generated claims only 'wheezy' as earliest based primarily on [P-1], missing the paired report in [P-2]. It omits non-productive cough [P-31] and 'looks fine otherwise' [P-9], but these are minor. Core facts correct with minor discrepancy on precise earliest symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: presentation symptoms (wheezy 4-5 days, short of breath, slight cough [P-1]), out of breath with activity [P-3], hard time catching breath/no cyanosis [P-32], difficulty deep breaths [P-2], cough recent [P-1]. Lists them comprehensively. Misses explicit non-productive cough [P-31] and 'looks fine' [P-9]; partially covers earliest (only wheezy, not both). Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All listed symptoms and citations ([P-1], [P-2], [P-3], [P-32]) directly verifiable in transcript. Descriptions match verbatim (e.g., 'quite wheezy', 'sounds like... short of breath', 'slight cough', 'difficulty taking in deep breaths', etc.). Minor unverifiable detail: references non-existent 'knowledge graph' and its associations, which is not in transcript (hallucination). No other fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing specific symptoms at presentation with citations and identifying earliest (wheezy). Structured sections perfectly focused; minor KG note is tangential but does not detract significantly."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is mostly accurate and comprehensive in listing symptoms with proper citations but has a minor error in specifying only wheezing (not both wheezing and difficulty with deep breaths) as earliest, plus a hallucinated knowledge graph reference."
