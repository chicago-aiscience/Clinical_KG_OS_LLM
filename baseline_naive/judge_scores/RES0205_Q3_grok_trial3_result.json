  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and the negative test result, with evidence of persistent dry cough and hospital worker status accurately matching the transcript and aligning with Gold Answer's core facts; however, it omits several specific converging factors emphasized in Gold (e.g., coworkers' fear, PPE use, exact flu-like symptoms citations), representing minor discrepancies but no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnosis (COVID-19), hospital work, persistent cough; partially covered: symptoms (cough details but not full flu-like specifics like sore throat/runny nose); missed: voluntary disclosure phrasing [P-35], coworkers scared [P-35], PPE/carefulness [P-17], test timing [P-36], staying home post-test [P-36]. Covers approximately 50-60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: cough duration [P-2], dry cough [P-5], hospital worker [P-34], negative COVID test [P-35]; the interpretive phrase on heightened suspicion is plausible and grounded in context without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question's three parts (diagnosis, evidence, results) with focused content and no off-topic material, perfectly matching the query."
