    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misidentifies the condition discussed by the doctor. The doctor explicitly mentioned 'asthma' in [D-45] as the condition that would be added to the differential if the presentation were different (just cough/SOB without fever). The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies 'another viral illness' and 'severe infection' as the alternative diagnosis, which are actually part of the current working diagnosis, not the excluded one. The clinical finding is also misidentified - the Generated Answer claims it was the temperature not being 'really high' that excluded the condition, when the Gold Answer correctly identifies that it was the presence of fever itself that excluded asthma from consideration.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to identify the key elements from the Gold Answer: (1) asthma as the specific condition, (2) the hypothetical presentation (cough or SOB alone without fever), (3) fever as the excluding factor for asthma, and (4) the doctor's conclusion that it 'sounds like an infection.' The Generated Answer covers 0% of the essential key points accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant misinterpretation of the transcript. While [D-44] is correctly cited, it discusses ER warning signs for the current suspected viral infection/COVID, not an alternative diagnosis. The actual relevant statement is in [D-45] where asthma is mentioned. The Generated Answer fabricates the interpretation that 'another viral illness' was an excluded diagnosis, when viral illness is actually the presumed diagnosis. This represents hallucination through misinterpretation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question about an excluded condition and the clinical finding that led to exclusion, but provides incorrect information. While it follows the structure of the question (identifying a condition and explaining why it was excluded), the content is factually wrong, making it only partially relevant to what was actually asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misidentifies both the excluded condition (claims 'another viral illness/severe infection' instead of asthma) and the excluding clinical finding (claims absence of 'really high temperature' instead of presence of fever). It incorrectly interprets [D-44] which discusses ER warning signs, missing the critical statement in [D-45] where the doctor explicitly mentions asthma would be considered without fever. This represents major factual errors with significant hallucination, covering none of the Gold Answer's key points accurately."
