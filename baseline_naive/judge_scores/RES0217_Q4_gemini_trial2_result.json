{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the bullseye rash as an absent clinical feature and the laboratory identification of the tick as a proposed diagnostic test. However, it fails to mention other assessed features and tests included in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is quite incomplete. It misses several clinical features assessed by the doctor (joint pain, fever, headaches, and general malaise) and omits key diagnostic proposals like the physical examination and blood work (titers/serology) specifically mentioned in the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. There are no hallucinations, though the coverage is limited.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question, although it only provides one example for each part, resulting in a less-than-thorough response."
