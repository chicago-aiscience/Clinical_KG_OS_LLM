  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s main diagnosis of asthma aligns with the Gold Answer’s conclusion of pediatric asthma/exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. However, it is less specific than the Gold Answer (does not explicitly identify exercise-induced bronchoconstriction or atopic predisposition) and adds “acute exacerbation,” which is not clearly supported by the transcript (symptoms are episodic with activity/rest rather than a continuous acute flare). Overall, the core diagnosis is correct with minor overreach on subtype/episode framing.",
    "completeness": "Covered key supporting findings: (1) exercise trigger [P-3], (2) cold-weather worsening [P-38], (3) seasonal allergies/Reactine use [P-35, P-36], (4) multiple settings [P-38]. Missed several Gold Answer supports: episodic/reversible with rest [P-6, P-33], recurrent pattern with activity [P-6], nocturnal episode [P-43, P-44], and pertinent negatives arguing against infection (no fever [P-7], no runny nose [P-8], no sick contacts [P-10], no phlegm [P-31]).",
    "faithfulness": "Most cited transcript-based claims are accurate and supported by the referenced lines. However, the answer introduces “Knowledge Graph” assertions (e.g., KG links between symptoms and cold weather) that are not present in the transcript, making portions of the justification unverifiable from the provided source and thus partially hallucinatory.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question by naming a respiratory diagnosis and listing transcript findings supporting it. Minor distraction comes from the “Knowledge Graph” commentary, but the content remains largely focused on the asked clinical reasoning."
