  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the respiratory symptoms and correctly identifies wheezing as an early symptom. However, it identifies only 'wheezy' as the earliest symptom, whereas the Gold Answer (and transcript [P-2]) identifies both 'wheezy' and 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' as the symptoms noticed first.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points, listing all the respiratory symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer. It misses the specific detail that the cough was non-productive (no phlegm) and the negative symptom (no cyanosis/turning blue) which were included in the Gold Answer's comprehensive description. It also omits 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' from the 'earliest symptom' specific section.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not part of the provided source materials, suggesting a slight hallucination regarding the context or source of information, though the clinical facts themselves are present in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question: the specific symptoms at presentation and the timeline of the earliest symptoms."
