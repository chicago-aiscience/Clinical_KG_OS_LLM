  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor *did* systematically explore exposure sources: living situation (apartment, alone) [P-45], home/environmental triggers (old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets) [D-46]/[P-46], sick contacts [D-47]/[P-47], workplace and workplace illness (car dealership; anyone at work sick) [P-48], [D-50]/[P-50], and travel history [D-49]/[P-49]. The Generated Answer directly contradicts these transcript details by claiming these questions were not asked.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer omits essentially all key points from the Gold Answer (living situation, environmental exposures, sick contacts, workplace environment and illness, travel history, and the conclusion that no clear source was identified). It instead states the opposite (that exposure was not explored).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not grounded in the transcript because it asserts that exposure-related questions \"were not asked or discussed,\" which is contradicted by multiple explicit dialogue turns ([P-45] through [P-50]). Although it correctly notes COVID testing and isolation were discussed [D-52], its main claim is a clear contradiction of the source.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to address the question about exposure sources, but instead of identifying them, it denies they were explored. This is on-topic but fails to provide the requested information."
