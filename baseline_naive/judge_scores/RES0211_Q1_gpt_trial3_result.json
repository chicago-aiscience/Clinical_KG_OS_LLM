    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several reported symptoms: 3–4 days of dry cough and scratchy throat (P-1, P-4), headache/head pounding (P-1, P-2), and general malaise/feeling “crappy” (P-1, P-14). It also correctly notes denial of sputum/phlegm production in substance (P-5, P-6), though it cites incorrect transcript locations.\n\nHowever, it contains major factual errors: (1) It states Jessica “confirmed experiencing night sweats (‘sheets are soaked’)” — in the transcript she does not endorse soaked sheets; she only reports feeling hot day and night (P-9). (2) It fabricates/incorrectly cites a sputum question and response (“D-33… P-29”), which do not correspond to sputum in the provided transcript. (3) It incorrectly claims the doctor did not inquire about nausea, joint pain, or rashes; the transcript clearly includes these questions and Jessica’s explicit denials (P-10 to P-13).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key reported symptoms: dry cough, scratchy throat, pounding headache/current headache, persistent feeling hot day and night, malaise/icky/crappy, tiredness. Generated Answer includes dry cough/scratchy throat, headache, feeling hot, malaise, and adds post-nasal drip (which is in transcript but not a core Gold symptom for the 3–4 day illness). It misses explicit inclusion of “icky” and “tired.”\n\nGold Answer key denied symptoms: no sputum/phlegm, no new rashes/skin changes, no nausea/vomiting, no diarrhea, no joint aches, no dyspnea from allergies. Generated Answer effectively includes only sputum/phlegm denial, and explicitly (but incorrectly) asserts there is no evidence of denials for nausea/joint pain/rashes—thereby missing multiple required denials.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not grounded or are contradicted by the transcript: the statement that she confirmed “night sweats (sheets are soaked)” is not supported (P-9 shows only feeling hot). The cited lines for sputum denial (D-33, P-29) are inaccurate/fabricated for that content. The claim that the transcript does not show inquiry about nausea/joint pain/rashes is directly contradicted by P-10 to P-13. These constitute multiple hallucinations/misrepresentations, despite some correctly grounded symptom reporting.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at listing reported symptoms and denied symptoms, which matches the question’s intent. However, it includes an unnecessary diagnostic framing (“consistent with a common cold”), and it fails to provide most of the denied symptoms the question explicitly asks for, reducing how well it addresses the query."
