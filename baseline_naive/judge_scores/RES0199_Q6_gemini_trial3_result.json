{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab, the 14-day isolation period, the condition for contact tracing (positive result), and the specific supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, and Tylenol/analgesics for aches). One minor discrepancy is the use of 'analgesics' instead of 'NSAIDs' (phonetically transcribed as 'anseads' in the source), but this is clinically acceptable.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers almost all key points. It misses the specific timeframe for test results (24-48 hours) and the mention of an alternative diagnosis (another viral illness) which were included in the Gold Answer. However, it successfully addresses all specific components requested in the prompt (test, isolation duration, contact tracing, and supportive care).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, specifically referencing section [D-52] for every claim. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly relevant, structured clearly to address each specific part of the user's multi-part question without adding unnecessary information."
