  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the key findings of the gold answer. It correctly identifies the chest X-ray and COVID swab as the proposed procedures and accurately quotes the rationale for the COVID test from the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main points (X-ray, COVID swab, and the specific rationale). However, compared to the gold answer, it omits the doctor's specific layman's description of the X-ray ('taking picture of your body on the inside'), the mention of the swab being uncomfortable, and the broader context of the doctor returning with a supervisor.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript. Citations for [D-37] and [D-39] are used correctly and reflect the speaker's statements without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays strictly focused on the diagnostic procedures and the rationale for the COVID swab as requested in the prompt."
