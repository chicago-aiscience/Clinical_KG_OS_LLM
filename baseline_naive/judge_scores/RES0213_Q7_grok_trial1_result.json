  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer outlines a broad timeline but omits key precise details from the Gold Answer, such as smoking starting at age 18 [P-18], escalation to 10 cigarettes/day for the past two years, reduction a few months ago [P-14, P-18], eight-year gap without anxiety [P-22], father's heart attack timing [P-8, P-30], and thesis-specific stress in the last couple of weeks [P-15, P-16]. It correctly notes current smoking reduction, teenage anxiety consultations [P-21], recent academic stress [P-4, P-28], and chest pain onset ~1.5 weeks ago [P-2, P-3]. However, it introduces speculative relationships (e.g., smoking directly contributing to teenage anxiety) not supported by Gold and references a non-existent 'knowledge graph' for causal links, introducing factual errors. Main sequence is correct but with discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: smoking history (partial, current reduction [P-14]), teenage anxiety attacks and doctor visit [P-21], recent academic stress escalation [P-4, P-28], chest pain onset 1.5 weeks ago as new symptom [P-2, P-3, P-17], stress as possible cause. Missed: smoking start at 18 [P-18], 2-year escalation to 10 cigs/day [P-18], few months ago reduction [P-18], 8-year anxiety-free period [P-22], father's heart attack [P-8, P-30], specific thesis time crunch last couple weeks [P-15, P-16], anxiety possibly returning [P-22], symptoms worse when alone [P-9, P-29]. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: smoking details [P-14], anxiety history [P-21], stress triggers [P-4, P-28], chest pain description [P-3, P-4, P-6]. Citations accurate where used. However, multiple hallucinations: repeated references to a 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript) for smoking-CV links and studying-chest pain causation; implies prompt as source for timeline; speculative causal chains (e.g., smoking to teenage anxiety) not directly verifiable. Some plausible inferences but unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response as timeline (smoking -> teen anxiety -> stress -> chest pain) with phase relationships, addressing the question's sequence and interconnections. Minor tangents include knowledge graph references and general medical knowledge, but core content focused on patient's history."
