    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemia as the condition placed lower on the differential and accurately cites the key evidence from D-36. However, it contains one factual error: it states the patient reported 'chest tightness rather than out-of-breathness during exercise,' but the patient actually did report some difficulty breathing (P-7: 'it was kind of harder to get a whole breath'). The Gold Answer more accurately captures this nuance by noting the patient 'didn't really get out of breath with exercise' in the classic cardiac pattern, while acknowledging the patient did report some difficulty. The Generated Answer also misses the specific denials of anxiety, sweating, and impending doom (P-6) that were explicitly screened.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer captures the main points but is incomplete. It correctly identifies cardiac ischemia and cites the absence of pain and the nature of chest tightness. However, it misses several key elements from the Gold Answer: (1) the explicit screening for and denial of anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom (D-6, P-6), (2) the patient's clear statement 'there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight' (P-5), (3) the doctor's specific questioning about chest pain versus tightness (D-5), and (4) the patient's relief statement about it 'probably not my heart' (P-35). The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful to the transcript but contains a problematic characterization. It states the patient 'didn't really get out of breath with exercise' as direct patient reporting, when this was actually the doctor's characterization in D-36. The patient in P-7 actually said 'it was kind of harder to get a whole breath,' which is somewhat contradictory. The citations are generally accurate, though [P-1] doesn't fully support all claims made. No major hallucinations are present, but the representation of who said what and the exact nature of the breathing difficulty is somewhat misleading.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question asked. It identifies the specific condition (cardiac ischemia), the nature of chest complaints (tightness vs pain, breathing patterns), and the absence of symptoms (no pain, no out-of-breath during exercise). All content is relevant to answering the question, though it could be more comprehensive. No irrelevant information is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemia as the deprioritized condition and cites key evidence about chest tightness and absence of pain. However, it has a factual inaccuracy regarding breathlessness (the patient did report some difficulty breathing despite the doctor's characterization), misses several important symptom denials (anxiety, sweating, impending doom), and lacks complete coverage of the evidence chain. The answer is relevant and mostly faithful to the transcript but incomplete in capturing all the nuanced evidence the doctor used to lower cardiac ischemia on the differential."
