  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies shortness of breath as a respiratory symptom, seizure as a neurological symptom, and 37.4 as the fever measurement. However, it omits the dry cough, which is a significant respiratory symptom explicitly discussed [D-2, P-2, D-4, P-4]. The Gold Answer provides comprehensive detail including the dry nature of the cough, timing of symptoms, and relevant negatives. The core facts are correct but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the main respiratory symptom (shortness of breath), the neurological symptom (seizure), and the fever measurement (37.4). However, it misses: (1) the dry cough as a second respiratory symptom, (2) timing details (onset that morning, three hours before consultation), (3) additional seizure context (felt fine after, went to bed), (4) temperature unit (Celsius), (5) patient's characterization of fever as 'mild', and (6) pertinent negative findings. The answer captures the essential elements but lacks the comprehensive detail present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The shortness of breath is confirmed in [P-1], the seizure in [P-8], and the temperature measurement of 37.4 in [P-5]. No hallucinated information is present. The answer is fully grounded in the source material, though it represents a selective rather than comprehensive extraction of relevant information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and objective fever measurement. However, it provides incomplete information by omitting the dry cough, which is a specific respiratory symptom explicitly requested. The answer is focused and contains no irrelevant information, but the incompleteness regarding respiratory symptoms reduces its overall relevance to the full scope of the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key symptoms (shortness of breath, seizure, fever measurement of 37.4) with accurate citations from the transcript. However, it significantly omits the dry cough as a second respiratory symptom and lacks important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as timing, characterizations, and relevant negatives. While factually accurate and fully grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations, the answer's completeness is notably reduced by missing approximately 40% of the key clinical details that would provide a comprehensive response to the question."
