  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the history of asthma and the failure to refill the rescue inhaler. However, it completely omits the relationship between skipping the evening dose of the maintenance inhaler and the recurrence of symptoms, which was a specific part of the user's question and is addressed in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific detail about reducing maintenance inhaler frequency from twice-daily to morning-only, the presence of secondary symptoms like hoarseness and phlegm, and the patient's observation that this episode feels 'different' than previous ones. It covers approximately 50% of the key clinical connections.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer repeatedly cites a 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' as a source for its claims. This 'Knowledge Graph' does not exist in the provided source transcript, constituting a hallucination of the source format/context. However, the medical claims themselves (aside from the source attribution) are generally supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant to the question of how the patient's history and behavior relate to their current symptoms. However, by ignoring the 'skipping the evening dose' part of the prompt in its detailed breakdown, it fails to fully address the specific query provided by the user. It also includes meta-references to a knowledge graph which are irrelevant to the user's clinical question sampled from a transcript alone."
