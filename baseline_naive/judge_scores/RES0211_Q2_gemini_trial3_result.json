  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer regarding the medication names (Claritin, Deyo) and the history of allergy shots. It correctly identifies the status of Claritin as being carried 'just in case.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer and requested by the prompt. Specifically, it omits the dosing/frequency details: the 3-month cycle for the birth control pill and the 'once a week in winter' schedule for allergy shots. It also omits the denial of carrying an EpiPen and the denial of medication allergies.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript and include appropriate citations. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and focuses entirely on the question asked without irrelevant information."
