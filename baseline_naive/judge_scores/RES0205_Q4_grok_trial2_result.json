  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition ruled out and the 'covid-19 test' as the specific test used, matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript 'does not explicitly specify the exact date or time the test was performed relative to the start of the symptoms,' directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [P-36], which states the test was done 'when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.' It also understates workplace concerns by only mentioning coworkers being scared, omitting key details like hospital employment, PPE use, staying home, and desire to return without coughing. The addition of a 'Knowledge Graph' is extraneous and not in the Gold or transcript. These represent significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 ruled out; (2) 'covid test' negative [P-35]; (3) test at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior [P-36]; (4) hospital clerk job [P-34]; (5) PPE use [P-17]; (6) coworkers scared [P-35]; (7) staying home post-test [P-36]; (8) eager to return without coughing [P-36]; (9) medication desire driven by workplace return [P-35]. Generated covers (1), (2), partially (3) via cough duration but denies timing specificity, and (6). Misses (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), and full timing detail. Covers approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about condition and test are verifiable [P-35]. Cough duration verifiable [P-2]. Coworkers scared verifiable [P-35]. However, claim that test timing is not explicitly specified is unverifiable and false per [P-36]. 'Knowledge Graph' reference is entirely hallucinated, not in transcript. Multiple ungrounded elements including fabricated absence of timing info and external KG structure.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to directly address each element of the question (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns) with bullet points, containing no off-topic content and perfectly focused despite inaccuracies."
