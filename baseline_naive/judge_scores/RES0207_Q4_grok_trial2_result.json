  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately lists specific denied symptoms (chest pain, feeling faint, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea, sputum production, prior SOB) and links them to cardiac, infectious, GI differentials. Generated Answer incorrectly focuses on seizure causality denial (misinterpreted from P-8 'I don't know if related') and medication compliance, ignoring the listed denied symptoms; it treats positives (fever, seizure) as key, contradicting Gold's emphasis on negatives ruling out differentials. Significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: denied chest pain[P-7], faint[P-8], taste/smell[P-19], sore throat[P-20], runny nose[P-21], sick contacts[P-16], travel[P-17], nausea[P-13], belly pain[P-14], diarrhea[P-15], sputum/dry cough[P-4], prior episodes[P-3]; links to cardiac/infectious/GI. Generated covers none of these, instead discussing seizure link and meds (0% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites transcript (P-1,5,8,9,23) but misinterprets P-8 as 'denial of causal link' (patient uncertain), fabricates 'clinical documentation would screen' outside transcript, adds ungrounded 'knowledge graph' and speculative differentials based on positives not negatives; multiple hallucinations and twisted claims.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for specific denied symptoms/exposures and differentials they address (e.g., cardiac via no chest pain); Generated shifts to positives (fever, seizure), epilepsy non-compliance, and unrelated differentials, largely ignoring denied screenings and their ruling-out purpose."
