  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer falsely claims the transcript contains no Doctor dialogue (only Patient responses [P-1] to [P-28]), which directly contradicts the provided transcript that includes full Doctor turns [D-1] to [D-33]; it identifies zero conditions or questions ruled out, while the Gold Answer accurately lists six specific conditions with matching citations, making the Generated Answer factually inaccurate on every point.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers six key conditions (traumatic injury, cardiac disease/angina, infectious illness, asthma, primary dyspnea, inherited arrhythmias) with precise questions and citations; Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead providing an irrelevant refusal based on a misreading of the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of all Doctor dialogue despite the transcript explicitly providing [D-#] turns throughout; no claims are verifiable against the transcript, as it fabricates a lack of physician inquiry that does not exist.",
    "relevance": "The answer does not address the question of identifying ruled-out conditions and specific doctor questions/lines of inquiry; instead, it incorrectly dismisses the possibility due to nonexistent 'missing' data, providing no relevant clinical analysis."
