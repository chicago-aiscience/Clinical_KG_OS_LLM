  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that details regarding the smoking history and sick contact exposure are not in the text. This is factually wrong; [P-40] explicitly mentions the 20-year smoking history, and [P-20] explicitly mentions the sick contact during dog walking. The Generated Answer fails to connect the specific events requested.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the smoking duration, the specific nature of the sick contact (dog walking friends), and the progression from that contact to the infection. It only provides a generic mechanism of 'infection causes exacerbation' without the patient-specific details requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims information is missing when it is clearly present in the source transcript, which is a significant failure of faithfulness. Furthermore, it introduces 'Knowledge Graph' terminology and structures that are not part of the source transcript provided.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant to the specific prompt because it denies the existence of the evidence needed to answer the question. It provides a generic clinical pathway instead of the specific patient-history-to-exacerbation chain requested."
