  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the symptoms and the clinical logic for diagnosing a URI. It correctly identifies how the absence of sputum and GI symptoms narrows the diagnosis. However, it attributes the reasoning to a 'knowledge graph' that was not provided in the source text.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers most key points including the specific symptoms and the importance of exclusions (sputum, GI, joint pain). It misses the epidemiological context mentioned in the Gold Answer regarding the brother's recent cold as a source of exposure, and it omits the specific mention of malaise/fatigue.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer significantly hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' and 'clinical knowledge base' throughout the response. While the patient symptom citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-7]) are accurate to the transcript, the source of the diagnostic mapping is fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, directly addressing both the presence of certain symptoms and the absence of others to support the doctor's assessment."
