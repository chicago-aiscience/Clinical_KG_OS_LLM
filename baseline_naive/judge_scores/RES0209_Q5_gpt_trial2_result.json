  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually inconsistent with both the Gold Answer and the transcript. It incorrectly states that the environmental triggers (exercise, cold air, spring pollen) and their relationship to the exacerbation are “absent from the provided transcript,” but they are explicitly described by the patient (P-9, P-11). It also incorrectly claims there is no evidence the clinician suspected undiagnosed allergies; the clinician directly asks about allergies after pollen is mentioned (D-12) and affirms it “would make sense” when the patient reports suspected but undiagnosed allergies (P-12, D-13). While it correctly notes current asthma symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheeze) and the sister’s asthma history, the central claims answering the question are wrong.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missing or incorrectly handled include: (1) all three triggers (exercise, cold air/winter, spring pollen) and their linkage to worsened symptoms; (2) the clinician’s allergy line of questioning prompted by pollen and the patient’s lack of formal allergy diagnosis; (3) the explicit escalation of rescue inhaler use from once every two weeks to 5–6 times/week (P-8); and (4) the clinician’s suggestion that a medication change is needed because rescue-only therapy is insufficient (D-43). The Generated Answer covers only partial context (symptoms and sister with asthma) and omits/denies most trigger/allergy content central to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript and/or directly contradict it: the claim that trigger information is absent; the claim that there is no evidence of suspected undiagnosed allergies; and references to a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript. Although some symptom statements are supported by transcript quotes, the answer contains multiple major unfaithful assertions about the core asked elements (triggers and allergies).",
    "relevance": "The question asks how the three triggers plus family history relate to the current exacerbation and the doctor’s suspicion of undiagnosed allergies. The response largely fails to address this relationship, instead focusing on general symptom description and stating it cannot be determined. This makes it only weakly aligned with the question’s intent."
