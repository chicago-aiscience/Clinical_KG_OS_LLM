  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately cites the patient's 40-year smoking history [P-35] and quitting two years ago [P-34] as direct context for mild COPD [P-27]. Generated Answer incorrectly states that the '40-year smoking history' is not in the transcript, which is a major factual contradiction. It also introduces a non-existent 'knowledge graph' for medication linkage and COPD causation, diverging from Gold's transcript-based explanation. Core facts like COPD diagnosis, medication, chest X-ray [D-43], and COVID suspicion [D-43] are partially correct, but significant errors undermine overall accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: smoking history [P-35/P-34], direct link to COPD, new/worsening/constant SOB unlike past [P-8/9/10/11], chest X-ray rationale [D-43], COVID alignment [D-43], combo risk, lifestyle contexts [P-33/39/12]. Generated covers COPD [P-27], medication [P-28], general SOB/sore throat, chest X-ray/COVID swab [D-43], COPD vulnerability. Misses smoking history entirely, direct smoking-COPD link, SOB specifics, lifestyle details. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated denies smoking history in transcript (false, [P-35]), cites fictional 'knowledge graph' and [KG] repeatedly (hallucination, no such source provided). Verifiable claims: COPD [P-27], LABA [P-28], symptoms [P-2/8-ish], D-43 accurate. Multiple hallucinations including missing transcript facts and invented references make it ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response around smoking-COPD relation (though erroneously) and COPD as risk for SOB/COVID presentation, mirroring question's two parts. Includes relevant symptom overlap and eval plans, with minor irrelevant KG tangents. Directly addresses question overall."
