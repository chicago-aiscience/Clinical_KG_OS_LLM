{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, fever) and the absence of specific symptoms (sputum, GI, joint pain) as supporting a URI/common cold diagnosis. It correctly interprets that a lack of sputum differentiates the condition from a lower respiratory process like pneumonia.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention the patient's general malaise and fatigue, the 3-4 day timeline of symptoms, and the critical clinical detail of her brother's recent cold, which provides evidence of household viral exposure. It focuses heavily on the prompt's listed symptoms but misses the broader clinical context provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer repeatedly refers to a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the provided source transcript or prompt instructions. This is a hallucinated methodological framework. However, the mapping of symptoms to the transcript citations ([P-1], [P-7], etc.) is accurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing how the presence and absence of specific symptoms lead to the doctor's assessment."
