  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that information on how the triggers relate to the current exacerbation is absent from the transcript, despite the triggers being explicitly identified in P-9 and P-11 and linked to increased bronchodilator use (P-8); it also denies the doctor's suspicion of undiagnosed allergies, contradicting D-12 ('so you have allergies too?') and D-13 ('that would make sense'), and introduces a non-existent 'knowledge graph'; these are significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: lists three triggers with citations (P-9, P-11), no other triggers (P-10), clinician's allergy inquiry and agreement (D-12/13), later revisit (D-31/P-31), sister with asthma (P-32), no other family issues (P-33/34), relevance to exacerbation via increased inhaler use (P-8) and med change suggestion (D-43). Generated covers family history (sister asthma) partially and some symptoms, but misses all trigger details, allergy suspicion discussion, and direct connections to exacerbation; covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absence of triggers' relation and allergy suspicion (directly contradicted by P-9, P-11, D-12, D-13); cites symptoms accurately (e.g., P-1, P-15) but fabricates 'knowledge graph' and unverifiable denials; multiple hallucinated or incorrect claims about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on relation of specific triggers + family history to exacerbation and doctor's allergy suspicion; Generated dodges triggers relation by claiming absence, denies allergy suspicion, shifts to general symptoms/family/diagnosis, introducing irrelevant 'knowledge graph'; largely off-topic from core query."
