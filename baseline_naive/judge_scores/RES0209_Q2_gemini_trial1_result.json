  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the medication as a bronchodilator. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the administration method, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions it is a 'puffer' (D-7, P-7). It also incorrectly claims the transcript does not contain a question about daily controller medication, missing the specific inquiry in D-5: 'do you have one that you take every day no matter what?' and the patient's negative response in P-5.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two of the three main components of the Gold Answer: the administration method (puffer) and the clinician's specific inquiry about daily controller medication (medication taken 'every day no matter what'). It only successfully identifies the bronchodilator.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits 'negative hallucinations' by claiming certain information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present. Specifically, it denies the existence of the 'puffer' mention and the 'every day' medication question, both of which are found in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it directly attempts to address all parts of the user's question, though it provides incorrect information for two-thirds of the prompt."
