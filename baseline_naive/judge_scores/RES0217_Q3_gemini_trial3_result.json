  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer regarding exposure history (hiking/gardening), attachment duration (>72 hours), and prior history (10 years ago, bullseye rash).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to include the 'geographic risk assessment' specifically requested in the prompt. It omits the mention of Strathroy and the doctor's consultation of the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, which were key points in the gold answer and the source transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is fully supported by the transcript with correct citations for the points it does include.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant to the question but is incomplete as it ignores one of the four specific components (geographic risk) explicitly listed in the prompt."
