  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states the initial onset as approximately one month ago, citing P-19 and P-21 which refer to sleep disruption rather than the cough's onset (actual onset is three months ago per P-2 and P-13); it fails to mention the intermittent dry nature for two months; correctly identifies sleep disruption at one month but omits 'nightly'; notes productive greenish sputum without the three-day timeline (P-12); wrongly claims no subjective fevers despite P-4 explicitly stating 'feeling like hot at night in the past couple days.' Significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3-month onset during pole dancing, intermittent dry for ~2 months, 1-month nightly sleep disruption causing fatigue, 3-day productive greenish sputum, couple days subjective fevers, doctor's summary. Generated covers sleep disruption (~1 month, partial), productive sputum description (no timeline), misses onset, intermittent phase, exact productive timeline, fevers entirely, doctor's echo. Covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims for onset misinterpret P-19/P-21 (sleep context, not onset; transcript has P-2/P-13 for 3 months); sleep cites accurate but incomplete; productive sputum cite P-9 accurate but misses P-12 timeline; hallucinates absence of fevers despite clear P-4 evidence. Multiple misinterpretations and one hallucinated absence.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response as a timeline addressing onset, sleep disruption, productivity, and fevers per the question, with no off-topic content, though incomplete and erroneous."
