  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by stating the patient has not reported taking prescribed medications. The transcript [P-28] explicitly states the patient is on a long-acting beta agonist for mild COPD. It correctly identifies the sore throat self-treatments (salt water gargle and painkillers).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the long-acting beta agonist, the vitamins [P-30], and the substance use history included in the Gold Answer. It focuses primarily on the sore throat treatments.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer fails the faithfulness check because it claims the patient did not report medications for chronic disease management, which is directly contradicted by the transcript [P-28]. This is a hallucination of absence.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant to the question asked, though it includes future-planned procedures (COVID swab, X-ray) which are not current or tried treatments as requested by the prompt."
