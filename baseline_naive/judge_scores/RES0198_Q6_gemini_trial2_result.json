  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all core facts present in the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), the specific supportive care (hydration, Tylenol Cold), the diagnostic test (swab, results in 48 hours), and the public health instructions (isolation and follow-up).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all specific items requested in the prompt. However, compared to the Gold Answer, it omits the doctor's statement regarding the expected duration of symptoms ('a few weeks') and the explanation that treatment is limited to supportive care for viral infections. These are part of the 'complete' plan communicated in D-39.",
    "faithfulness": "The substantive content is entirely grounded in the transcript (D-39). However, the Generated Answer includes hallucinated citation tags like '[KG]' which do not exist in the source transcript, representing an error in citation accuracy.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure perfectly, addressing each component of the management plan specified in the prompt."
