  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma reoccurrence as the top differential (D-35) and links presenting symptoms (chest tightness, dyspnea on exertion from P-1, P-7, P-9, P-10) with asthma history (P-16), absence of cardiac pain (D-36), but inaccurately emphasizes 'current use of salbutamol' (P-25) as a positive linking factor without noting the critical non-adherence (skipping evening doses P-19, no rescue refill P-17-18), which Gold Answer highlights as synthesized in D-34; misses patient's acknowledgment it could be related (P-16 full), no new triggers (P-33); main point of symptoms + history → asthma is correct but significant discrepancies in linking and omissions → score 3.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) asthma history [P-16,P-29] covered; (2) med limiting/skipping evening/no rescue [P-17-19,D-34] missed; (3) exertional diffuse tightness/dyspnea [P-1,7,9,10] partially covered; (4) pt thinks could be related tho different [P-16] missed; (5) no env triggers [P-33] missed; (6) no cardiac sxs [D-36] covered; (7) rescue trial [D-35] partially as intervention. Covers ~3/7 key points substantially → score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-1,P-7,P-16,P-25,D-35,D-36); interpretations like symptoms consistent with asthma, rule out cardiac, propose rescue puffers grounded; no hallucinated facts → score 5.",
    "relevance": "Answer structured as breakdown of symptoms, history, clinical features, and explicit linking section directly mirroring question's request for combination and how doctor connected findings; no off-topic content → score 5"
