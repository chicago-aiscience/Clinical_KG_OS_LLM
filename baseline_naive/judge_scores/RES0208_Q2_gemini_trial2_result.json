  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer. It correctly identifies Avodart for prostate enlargement and Tums for reflux. It also accurately describes the patient's independent decision to stop his previous reflux medication because he identified dietary triggers.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the specific points requested in the question (medications, conditions, regimen change, and reason). Compared to the gold answer, it omits some supplementary information such as the patient's denial of allergies, the specific frequency of Tums usage ('here and there'), and the doctor's reaction to the medication change. However, it covers approximately 85% of the gold answer's content.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The details about Avodart [P-25, P-26], Tums [P-27], and the dietary management of reflux [P-27] are all present in the source text. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific questions asked. It provides a structured response that addresses each part of the prompt without unnecessary filler."
