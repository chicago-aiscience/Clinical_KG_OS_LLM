  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the onset (4 days ago), the initial symptoms (headache and cough), and the onset of anosmia (1 day ago). However, it incorrectly states that specific details regarding the severity fluctuations of the headache and cough were not provided, whereas the transcript explicitly states they 'stayed around the same' (P-9, P-11). It also provides a slightly less precise timeline for GI symptoms compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The response fails to capture the 'remained stable' aspect of the headache and cough severity which was specifically requested by the prompt. It also generalizes the timing of gastrointestinal symptoms (grouping nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea together as occurring 'few days back' or 'three days into the illness'), whereas the Gold Answer and transcript differentiate the timing for diarrhea (2 days ago), vomiting (yesterday), and nausea (today).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, but the claim that 'specific daily fluctuations in severity were not detailed' is a minor hallucination of omission, as the patient provided a clear assessment of stability ('stayed around the same').",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses all parts of the multi-part question, though it fails to find the specific information required for the final part regarding symptom stability."
