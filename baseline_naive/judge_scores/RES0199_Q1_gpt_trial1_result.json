  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes that the cough and headache started four days ago and that the patient had nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. However, it incorrectly states that key characteristics were “not described,” even though the transcript clearly specifies them: the cough was mostly dry with no sputum/blood; diarrhea was liquid stools 5–6 times/day; vomiting occurred twice; and headache severity was rated 7/10. These are major factual errors/contradictions relative to the transcript/Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points required by the question that are missed: (1) cough nature = mostly dry; (2) no sputum or blood; (3) diarrhea frequency = 5–6/day and liquid stools; (4) vomiting episodes = two, no blood, food contents; (5) headache severity rating = 7/10. The Generated Answer includes only the presence and approximate onset of symptoms, omitting nearly all requested specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "While the answer does not add fabricated symptoms, it repeatedly claims information is “not provided in the transcript” when it actually is provided (dry cough, diarrhea frequency, vomiting count, headache severity). This misrepresents the source and is therefore not well-grounded/faithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms and the requested characteristics, without irrelevant tangents. However, it fails to supply the requested details (handled under completeness/correctness), not relevance."
