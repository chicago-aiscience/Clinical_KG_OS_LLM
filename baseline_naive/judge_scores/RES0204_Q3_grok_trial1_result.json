  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer emphasizes the combination of present symptoms (dry cough for 4-5 days, non-improving, clear runny nose) and numerous absent findings (no fever/chills, sore throat, anosmia, chest pain, muscle pain, headaches, nausea, etc., no sick contacts/travel) leading to the orders. Generated correctly identifies dry cough and clear runny nose with citations, persistent nature, family history of asthma, and direct quotes for rationales [D-37, D-39]. However, it underemphasizes or omits the detailed pertinent negatives and their role in prompting imaging despite low-acuity presentation, attributes X-ray partly to family asthma more prominently than Gold, and introduces 'knowledge graph' not in Gold or transcript. Main point of symptoms + protocol → orders is correct, but some errors in emphasis and extras. Score: 3.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: present symptoms with durations/non-improving/citations; detailed list of negatives (fever/chills, sore throat, taste/smell, chest/muscle pain, headaches, nausea etc.); no contacts/travel; family asthma; novelty/persistent despite absent high-acuity → X-ray; protocol → COVID with quote. Generated covers: dry cough/runny nose (partial durations), family asthma, quotes for both orders, persistent cough. Misses: exact durations, non-improving explicit, full negatives list, no contacts/travel, novelty, 'absent high-acuity markers' role. Covers ~50-70% of points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms (dry cough [D-5], runny nose clear [D-11/12]), physical exam plan [D-1], family history asthma [D-28/P-28], X-ray rationale [D-37], COVID protocol [D-39] all verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, 'knowledge graph provided' and 'linked to asthma in the knowledge graph' are fully hallucinated (no knowledge graph in transcript). 'Respiratory distress' is exaggerated (no distress described). Multiple hallucinated elements. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on how present AND absent findings combination led to both orders. Generated directly addresses symptoms → X-ray (lungs) and COVID (protocol), uses structure/breakdown/quotes, stays on topic. Minor tangents like knowledge graph and 'respiratory distress'; underplays absent findings but still ties to question. Mostly relevant. Score: 4"
