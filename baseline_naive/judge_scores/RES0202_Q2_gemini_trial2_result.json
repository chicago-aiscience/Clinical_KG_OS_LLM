  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's information regarding the diagnostic test (COVID swab), the isolation duration (14 days), the isolation target (younger sister), the test result timeframe (24-48 hours), and the specific ER return-to-care precautions (seizures, weakness, etc.).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of the points in the Gold Answer. It successfully addresses all specific parts of the prompt (test, isolation, duration, target) and includes the ER instructions. However, it omits several details present in the Gold Answer: the full household composition (parents), the possibility of false negatives, the discussion of other viral illnesses, the note that no medications were prescribed, and the school's requirement for a test result.",
    "faithfulness": "Every claim in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript, specifically in section [D-44]. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, focusing strictly on the specific management measures asked for in the question without unnecessary fluff."
