  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer includes some accurate details like the bothersome cough [P-1], greenish gross sputum [P-9], fatigue, and sleep disturbance [P-19], but has significant errors: misrepresents chest pain as explicitly denied citing [P-19] when patient reported discomfort only when coughing [P-3] and denied constant pain/body pain; omits key durations (3 months total, productive 3 days, nightly waking last month), initial dry/intermittent nature [P-2], no blood [P-10], no foul smell [P-11], subjective fevers [P-4], exercise impairment [P-47]; fabricates 'knowledge graph'; contradicts Gold on denial scope.",
    "completeness": "Covers minor points: bothersome cough, hurts when coughing (partial), greenish gross sputum, fatigue, sleep disturbance (~25% coverage). Misses vast majority from Gold: 3-month duration, dry-to-productive change, pole dancing onset [P-13], no blood/foul smell, specific night waking last month [P-20/21], fevers [P-4], exercise issue [P-47]; all major denials (night sweats [P-5], weight loss [P-6-8], hemoptysis [P-10], N/V [P-17], stiff neck [P-18], body pain [P-19], sick contacts [P-14/15/32]).",
    "faithfulness": "Quotes and citations from transcript are accurate where used (e.g., [P-1], [P-3], [P-9], [P-19]), but hallucinates 'knowledge graph information provided' (absent); misinterprets [P-19] as denying chest pain (ignores [P-3] admission of cough-related hurt); omits verifiable transcript details; denial claim not fully grounded as patient partially acknowledged cough pain.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported respiratory symptoms, sputum, associated symptoms (fatigue/sleep), and explicit denials, matching question focus without off-topic content, though incomplete and erroneous."
