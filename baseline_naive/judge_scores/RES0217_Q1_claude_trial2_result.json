  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness behind left knee), but completely misrepresents the systemic screening. The Generated Answer claims the doctor screened for 'drug allergies' which is factually incorrect - the doctor actually asked about joint pain [D-7/P-7], fever/feeling ill [D-8/P-8], and headaches [D-19/P-19], all of which the patient denied. The statement that 'the provided transcript segments do not contain explicit evidence' of these screenings is demonstrably false, as they are clearly present in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the required content. It adequately describes the local symptoms but completely fails to accurately report the systemic symptoms screening. It mentions only one (incorrect) systemic screening item (drug allergies) instead of the three requested (fever, joint pain, headaches). The local symptom description is reasonably complete, but the systemic symptom section is fundamentally flawed.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer shows poor faithfulness to the transcript. While the local symptom descriptions are grounded in the transcript, the systemic screening section fabricates information by claiming drug allergy screening was the systemic review, and then falsely states that fever, joint pain, and headache screenings are not in the transcript when they clearly are at [D-7], [D-8], and [D-19] respectively. This represents significant hallucination about what is absent from the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is partially relevant. It correctly addresses the question about local symptoms at the bite site. However, it fails to relevantly address the second part of the question about systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, headaches) that were screened for and denied. Instead, it incorrectly discusses drug allergies, which is tangential to the question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies local symptoms at the tick bite site but contains major errors in the systemic symptom screening section. It incorrectly claims the doctor screened for drug allergies as a systemic symptom and falsely states that fever, joint pain, and headache screenings are not in the transcript, when they clearly are present at [D-7], [D-8], and [D-19]. This represents significant factual inaccuracy and hallucination about transcript content."
