  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error. It states there is 'no information available' regarding hereditary factors and family history, when the transcript clearly shows at [D-26, P-26] that the doctor asked about family history and the patient explicitly stated 'Yeah, epilepsy runs in the family. My mom had it.' This is a major omission that contradicts the Gold Answer's accurate identification of maternal epilepsy as a hereditary risk factor. The medication-related risk factor (Keppra non-adherence) is correctly identified.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the medication non-adherence risk factor and mentions Keppra, but completely misses the hereditary risk factor and family history information. The Gold Answer comprehensively addresses both medication-related and hereditary factors, while the Generated Answer explicitly denies the existence of hereditary information that is clearly present in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates poor faithfulness to the transcript. It explicitly claims 'There is no information available in the transcript regarding the patient's family history,' which is factually incorrect as the transcript contains a clear exchange at [D-26, P-26] where family history of epilepsy is discussed. This represents a failure to ground the response in the actual transcript content, though the medication-related information is accurately cited.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is partially relevant. It directly addresses the question about medication-related risk factors and attempts to address hereditary factors and family history. However, by incorrectly stating that hereditary and family history information is absent, it fails to provide the complete relevant answer to the question asked. The structure attempts to address all components of the question, but the content is incomplete."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose) as a risk factor but contains a critical error by stating there is no family history information available. The transcript clearly shows at [D-26, P-26] that the patient reported maternal epilepsy ('My mom had it'). This significant omission of hereditary risk factors results in an incomplete and partially inaccurate response that covers only half of the required information."
