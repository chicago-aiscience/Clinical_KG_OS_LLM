  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the progression of symptoms as stated in the transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the start of the cough on Wednesday night, the worsening of the cough and appearance of fatigue on Thursday, and the appearance of fever and appetite loss on Friday.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses a few details found in the Gold Answer: the mild runny nose mentioned in [P-16], the potential loss of taste mentioned in [P-17], and the specific clarification/correction of the 3-day timeline versus the 5-day timeline in [P-4]. However, it addresses all specific requirements explicitly asked for in the prompt (cough, fever, fatigue, appetite).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited to the appropriate turns (e.g., [P-1], [P-15], [P-17]). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific timeline requested by the user without irrelevant tangents."
