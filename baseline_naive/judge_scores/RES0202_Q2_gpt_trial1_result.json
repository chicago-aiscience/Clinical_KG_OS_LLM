  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the COVID swab test, expected turnaround (24–48 hours), the 14-day isolation recommendation, and the specific instruction to isolate from the younger sister. It also correctly includes the ER/return precautions (high temperature, neurologic symptoms including seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting), all consistent with [D-44]. No contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Relative to the Gold Answer, it covers the major management steps: COVID swab with timing, 14-day isolation, and isolating from the younger sister, plus the ER precautions. It omits several additional Gold Answer points: acknowledgement of possible false negatives, possibility of another circulating viral illness if negative, supportive/observational approach with no medications and waiting for results, and the school’s requirement for a COVID test to return. Thus, it captures most but not all Gold Answer elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are grounded in the transcript, primarily [D-44]. No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions are present.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question’s requested elements (diagnostic test, isolation instructions/duration, and who to isolate from) and adds closely related safety-net instructions, which remain relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, well-grounded, and highly relevant, but misses a few additional management details included in the Gold Answer (false-negative/alternate viral illness discussion, supportive/no-medication plan, and school testing requirement)."
