  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key viral-URI supporting elements that match the Gold Answer: predominant nasal congestion/rhinorrhea and the clinician’s explicit assessment of “most likely a viral infection like the common cold,” clear nasal discharge, and a 1-week duration with expectation that symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve. However, it adds an unsupported claim about a “knowledge graph” corroborating the diagnosis, which is not in the transcript or Gold Answer. It also implies distinctions about allergic reactions being “sudden acute” and infers absence of systemic symptoms without citing the patient’s specific denials (fever, cough, etc.), which weakens factual precision but does not directly contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) congestion + runny nose; (2) clear discharge; (3) 1-week duration and clinician noting it can take a few weeks.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: explicit absent features supporting viral over bacterial/allergic (no cough, no sore throat/SOB, no fever/chills, no post-nasal drip), lack of colored discharge emphasized as anti-bacterial, lack of headache (anti-bacterial), allergy history/exposure negatives (no known allergies; no fumes/dust/animals), symptom progression (stuffy first then runny), and daycare exposure context (nephew in daycare). Overall, it captures roughly about half of the supporting evidence but omits several major differentiators.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (symptoms, clear discharge, duration, supportive care, COVID swab). Unfaithful/unverifiable elements include the “knowledge graph” reference and generalized assertions about allergic reactions and bacterial/systemic symptom patterns that are not explicitly stated in the visit (even though the patient did deny systemic symptoms elsewhere). This represents some hallucination/unsupported framing, but not pervasive fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on why the presentation supports a viral rather than allergic/bacterial cause and uses visit details (symptoms, discharge, timeline, clinician assessment). Minor tangents (COVID context, “knowledge graph”) do not overwhelm the main answer."
