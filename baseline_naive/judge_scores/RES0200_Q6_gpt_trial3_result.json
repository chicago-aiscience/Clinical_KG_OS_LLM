  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the plan described in D-52: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function tests, ABG, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation measurement with supplemental oxygen as needed, continuation of bronchodilators, and addition of steroids and antibiotics. The COVID swab is correctly included to rule out COVID-19. Minor wording differences (e.g., calling therapies “prescribed” vs “will give”) do not change the factual meaning. Classifying the COVID swab under “monitoring” rather than “laboratory tests” is a categorization issue but not a factual error about what was ordered.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring, supplemental oxygen as needed, continue bronchodilators, add steroids, add antibiotics. Missed: (1) the stated COVID test turnaround time (24–48 hours) from D-52; (2) the additional blood pressure monitoring advice from D-37 noted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included elements are supported by the transcript (primarily D-52, with bronchodilator examples supported by P-11). No clear hallucinated tests, imaging, or treatments. The purpose phrasing for CXR is a reasonable inference but does not introduce new, unsupported interventions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested categories (labs, imaging, monitoring, and new/continued therapies for COPD exacerbation) and does not add irrelevant content."
