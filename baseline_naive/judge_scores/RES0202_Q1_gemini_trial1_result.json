{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error. It explicitly states that the doctor did not ask about symptoms like wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, and GI complaints, and that they weren't denied. However, the transcript shows the doctor asking about wheezing (D-7), chest pain (D-13), sore throat (D-14), chills (D-19), and GI issues (D-22, D-23), all of which the mother denied. It also misses the reported 'runny nose'.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies most of the reported (positive) symptoms correctly. However, it fails almost entirely on the second part of the prompt, which asks for the symptoms explicitly denied. It incorrectly claims these symptoms were not asked about, missing about 50% of the key points required by the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the doctor did not ask about the specific symptoms listed in the prompt is a hallucination or failure to parse the transcript. These questions are clearly present in the mid-section of the dialogue. The citations provided for the 'denied' section (D-44) refer to red-flag warnings given at the end of the encounter rather than the history-taking questions asked earlier.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it addresses both parts of the question, but the second part provides incorrect information based on a misreading of the text. It also includes irrelevant details about red-flag instructions (seizures, weakness) that weren't part of the mother's reported symptoms or the specific list asked for in the prompt."
