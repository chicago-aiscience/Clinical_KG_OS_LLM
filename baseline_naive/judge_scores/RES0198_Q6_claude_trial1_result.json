  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. Both identify the viral infection/common cold diagnosis, the two specific supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold), the COVID swab test with 48-hour turnaround, and the isolation/public health guidance. The Generated Answer adds a minor detail about 'ruling in or out COVID-19' which is implied but not explicitly stated in the Gold Answer, though this is a reasonable inference from context. No factual errors or contradictions exist.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) working diagnosis of viral infection/common cold, (2) both supportive care recommendations (hydration and OTC medications like Tylenol Cold), (3) expectation of weeks for symptom resolution, (4) COVID swab ordered for today with 48-hour results, (5) isolation instructions, and (6) further public health instructions after results. The organization is slightly different but all elements are present. The Generated Answer includes the detail about 'not much beyond supportive care' being available, matching the Gold Answer's acknowledgment.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-39]. The diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance are all explicitly stated by the doctor. The citations to [D-39] are accurate throughout. The mention of 'ruling in or out COVID-19' is a reasonable interpretation of the swab's purpose as stated in the transcript. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and completely addresses the question about the doctor's complete management plan communicated at the end of the visit. It systematically covers the diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance as requested. The structured format with clear sections enhances relevance. No irrelevant information is included."
