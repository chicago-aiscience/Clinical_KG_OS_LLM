  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect. It claims that the transcript lacks doctor dialogue and only contains patient responses [P-1] through [P-28]. However, the provided transcript clearly includes doctor turns (labeled [D-1] through [D-33]) interspersed with patient turns up to [P-33]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies the doctor's screening questions, while the Generated Answer fails to identify any.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not list any conditions (Traumatic injury, Cardiac disease, Infectious illness, Asthma, Dyspnea, or Arrhythmias) nor the specific questions used to rule them out.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source text. It hallucinates a structural limitation (the absence of doctor turns) that does not exist in the provided transcript. It also incorrectly states that patient turns only go up to [P-28], whereas they go to [P-33].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. It provides a refusal to answer based on a false premise about the source material."
