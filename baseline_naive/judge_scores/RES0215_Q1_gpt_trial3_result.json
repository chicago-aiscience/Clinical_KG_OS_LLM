  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key respiratory symptoms mentioned in the transcript (wheezing, shortness of breath, cough) and also accurately notes related descriptions (difficulty taking deep breaths, out of breath with activity, hard time catching her breath). However, it states that wheezing alone was the earliest symptom; in the transcript, the mother reports the earliest symptoms as both wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths (difficulty taking in deep breaths) [P-2]. Thus, the timeline attribution is partially incorrect/incomplete compared with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures most of the respiratory symptoms at presentation and during episodes (wheeze, SOB, cough, exertional dyspnea, difficulty with deep breaths/catching breath). It misses key Gold Answer elements: that difficulty taking deep breaths was also an earliest symptom (not just wheeze), and it does not include the Gold Answer’s additional respiratory-related details (non-productive cough/no phlegm [P-31] and denial of cyanosis [P-32]).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate turn references. The main ungrounded element is the mention of a \"knowledge graph\" and its stated associations; this is not present in the transcript and is extraneous. Aside from that, the symptom descriptions are faithful to the provided dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer largely focuses on the asked items (respiratory symptoms at presentation and which appeared earliest). It includes a minor tangent about a \"knowledge graph\" and extra framing, but this does not overwhelm the response."
