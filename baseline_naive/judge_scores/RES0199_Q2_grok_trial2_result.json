  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the patient's home medication for headache relief, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-3, P-4]. Doctor's recommendations for hydration, nutritious food, sleeping well, Tylenol for fever, and Tylenol/anseads (intended as NSAIDs) for aches are mostly accurate. However, it omits the COVID-19 swab test, 14-day isolation, patient's self-hydration efforts [P-30], and explicit note of no prescriptions. It introduces an unverifiable 'knowledge graph' reference. Minor discrepancies with core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: Tylenol for headache (yes), headache as symptom (yes), doctor recommends hydration (yes), nutritious food (yes), sleeping well (yes), Tylenol for fevers (yes), Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches (yes, as anseads). Missed: patient's self-hydration [P-30], COVID swab test, 14-day isolation, explicit no prescription medications. Covers approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-3, D-52]; 'Tylenol for headache' from [P-3]; supportive measures from [D-52]. Minor issues: 'knowledge graph indicates' is hallucinated/not in transcript; 'anseads (analgesics)' interprets likely transcription error for NSAIDs plausibly but not verbatim. Mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response into patient's pre-visit medication/symptom and doctor's additional recommendations/supportive measures; no irrelevant content or tangents."
