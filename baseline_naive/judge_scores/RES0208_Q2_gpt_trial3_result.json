  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two current medications (Avodart and Tums), correctly links Avodart to an enlarged prostate/BPH and Tums to reflux, and correctly describes that the patient stopped his prior reflux medication after identifying dietary triggers/foods that controlled symptoms. No contradictions with the Gold Answer. The only minor issue is specifying Tums as “calcium carbonate,” which is not stated in the transcript (though it is generally true).",
    "completeness": "Covers all key elements asked and present in the Gold Answer: (1) Avodart and indication (enlarged prostate/BPH), (2) Tums and indication (reflux), and (3) the patient independently discontinued his prior reflux medication and why (dietary modification/figuring out foods). It appropriately omits allergies since they were not asked in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all content is directly supported by the transcript. The added parenthetical “calcium carbonate” for Tums is not explicitly stated in the transcript, making it a minor ungrounded detail, but the rest is well-grounded and consistent with cited lines.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question about current medications, the condition each is for, and the patient-initiated change to reflux meds and rationale. No meaningful tangents."
