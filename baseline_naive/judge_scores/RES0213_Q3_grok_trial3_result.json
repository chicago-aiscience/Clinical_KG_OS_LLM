  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety as the diagnosis, aligning closely with the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' Core facts like situational triggers (studying/walking), history of anxiety attacks, academic stress, and patient self-attribution to stress are consistent. Minor discrepancies include broader phrasing of diagnosis and emphasis on analgesics response (present in transcript but not highlighted in Gold), but no major errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) situational pattern with resolution on distraction [P-4,P-9,P-29] - partially covered (triggers yes, resolution indirect/weak); (2) anxiety history [P-21,P-22] - fully covered; (3) thesis stress [P-13,P-15,P-16] - covered; (4) nervousness/breathing [P-19] - missed; (5) patient considers stress [P-8] - covered; (6) pertinent negatives (fevers [P-12], exertional [P-10], rest [P-11], palpitations [P-20], asthma [P-23,P-24]) - partially covered via differential but specifics missed. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: situational [P-4], history [P-21,P-8], meds [P-6], stress management [P-28]. However, multiple hallucinations: 'Knowledge Graph' references (e.g., studying/walking causes chest pain, smoking causes heart attack) not in transcript; indirect link of reading books to symptom relief (plausible but stretched from stress management). Several unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses diagnosis (anxiety) and supporting observations from consultation, structured with evidence. Minor off-topic elements like Knowledge Graph and analgesics, but overall focused on question."
