  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately lists reported symptoms (dry cough/scratchy throat, headache, feeling hot day/night, malaise/icky/crappy, tired) with correct citations and denied symptoms (sputum/phlegm [P-5,P-6], rashes/skin changes [P-10], nausea/vomiting [P-11], diarrhea [P-12], joint aches [P-13], no breathing difficulty [P-18]). Generated Answer correctly identifies some reported symptoms (dry cough/scratchy throat [P-1,P-4], headache [P-1,P-2], feeling hot [P-9], malaise [P-1]) but inaccurately claims confirmation of 'night sweats (sheets soaked)' (P-9 describes feeling hot but not soaked sheets, hallucination), adds unrelated 'post nasal drip' as current symptom (P-18 is allergy history, not new 3-4 day symptom), misses 'tired' [P-13]. For denials, correctly notes sputum denial but uses wrong citations ([D-33,P-29] unrelated; actual [D-5,D-6,P-5,P-6]), falsely claims no inquiries/denials for nausea, joint pain, rashes (present in [D-10-13,P-10-13]), ignores diarrhea and breathing denial. Significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold reported symptoms covered: dry cough/scratchy throat (yes), headache (yes), feeling hot (partial, extras added), malaise/crappy (yes), tired (no). Gold denied symptoms covered: sputum/phlegm (partial, wrong cite), skin changes/rashes (no), nausea/vomiting (no), diarrhea (no), joint aches (no), can't breathe (no). Covers ~30-40% of key points (some reported yes, only 1/6 denied).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: dry cough/scratchy [P-1,P-4], headache [P-1,P-2], hot [P-9], malaise [P-1] grounded. Unverifiable/hallucinated: night sweats sheets soaked (P-9 no), post nasal drip as new symptom (P-18 allergy context), sputum denial wrong cites [D-33,P-29] (actual [D-5,P-5 etc.]), false claim transcript lacks nausea/joint/rashes inquiries (present [D-10-13]). Multiple hallucinations and citation errors.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported symptoms (3-4 days) and denied symptoms, addressing question focus despite incompleteness and errors; minor extraneous note on common cold."
