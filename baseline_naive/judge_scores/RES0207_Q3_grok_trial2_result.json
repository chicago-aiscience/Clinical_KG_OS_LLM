  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient attributes the missed Keppra dose to the seizure, directly quoting P-9 which matches the Gold Answer's key evidence. It correctly identifies the seizure timing (previous night from P-8) and medication (P-23). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer; the phrasing 'direct precipitating factor' aligns with patient's implied view in transcript, though Gold notes lack of clinician confirmation, but this is not contradicted.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: missed dose (Keppra) connected to seizure same night (via P-8, P-9, P-23); patient's recognition in P-9 with quote. Missed: specific reason for missing dose (daughter's birthday disrupting routine from P-24); patient's statement on rarity of seizures ('usually don't get seizures very often' P-9); voluntary nature in response to D-9 (not prompted by med adherence question); emphasis on one-time lapse and no clinician confirmation. Covers ~60-70% of Gold's nuanced points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: P-9 quote verbatim and contextually accurate for patient's attribution; P-8 confirms seizure/epilepsy; P-23 names Keppra. Citations precise, no unverifiable or hallucinated details; fully verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of question: connection of missed dose to seizure (patient's attribution as cause) and evidence of patient's recognition (P-9 quote, supported by P-8/P-23). Concise, no off-topic content."
