  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the initial symptoms as headache and cough starting four days prior and notes loss of smell beginning about one day prior. However, it inaccurately places the onset of GI symptoms as “approximately three days into the illness”; the transcript specifies diarrhea began ~2 days ago, vomiting occurred yesterday (two episodes), and nausea was present today. It also incorrectly implies that daily fluctuations in headache/cough severity were not detailed, when the transcript explicitly states both headache and cough “stayed around the same.”",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) headache and cough first at day 4; (2) GI symptoms appeared after initial symptoms; (3) loss of smell began ~1 day ago. Key points missed/insufficient: (1) diarrhea onset ~2 days ago with frequency (5–6/day); (2) nausea today and vomiting yesterday (two episodes) and that nausea/vomiting were described as starting “a few days back”; (3) explicit stability over time—headache stayed the same in severity and cough stayed the same; (4) the question’s requested comparison of GI and anosmia timing relative to initial symptoms is only loosely stated and not anchored to the correct day counts.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are broadly consistent with the transcript, but the claim that GI symptoms appeared “approximately three days into the illness” is not directly supported (and conflicts with the stated 2-day diarrhea onset). Also, stating that severity changes were “not detailed” is contradicted by the transcript (they were explicitly discussed). These constitute moderate ungrounded/incorrect assertions.",
    "relevance": "The answer focuses on the symptom timeline and attempts to address development over four days, including onset order and later anosmia. It is somewhat incomplete for the specific asked elements (relative timing and stability of headache/cough), but it remains on-topic."
