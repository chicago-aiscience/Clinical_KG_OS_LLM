  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states Jessica 'first noticed a dry cough and scratchy throat' as the initial symptoms, but the Gold Answer and transcript [P-4] clearly show she first noticed the scratchy throat, THEN started coughing. The order is explicitly stated by Jessica when asked 'What did you first notice?' - she responds 'I first noticed that my throat was kind of scratchy and then I started coughing.' This reverses the actual sequence. The timing of feeling hot is also less precisely characterized than in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers some key points but misses important details. It correctly identifies the 3-4 day timeframe and mentions the scratchy throat, dry cough, headache, and feeling hot. However, it omits the general malaise/feeling 'crappy overall' [P-1, P-14], fatigue [P-13], and the doctor's summary characterizing it as 'a little bit of fever' [D-58]. It also doesn't mention the progression from localized upper airway symptoms to broader systemic symptoms. Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is largely grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-7, P-9]. However, the interpretation of symptom order contradicts the explicit statement in [P-4]. The claim that feeling hot 'likely began alongside' the initial symptoms is speculative rather than directly stated in the transcript, though it's a reasonable inference from the available information. Most claims are verifiable, but the key error regarding symptom order undermines faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about symptom order, progression timeline, and the relationship between feeling hot and other symptoms. It is well-focused on the question components. However, the incorrect symptom sequencing means it fails to properly answer the core question about 'what order' symptoms appeared, which was explicitly asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question about symptom progression but contains a critical factual error by reversing the order of initial symptoms (stating cough and throat together rather than throat first, then cough). It covers moderate detail about the timeline and feeling hot, but omits several key points like malaise and fatigue. While mostly grounded in the transcript and relevant to the question, the fundamental error in symptom sequencing significantly undermines its correctness and utility for clinical documentation."
