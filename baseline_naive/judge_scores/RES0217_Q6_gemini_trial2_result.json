  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it claims the doctor did not provide preventive advice about the garden, whereas the transcript (D-18) clearly shows the doctor advising on ticks in long grass and recommending insecticide. It also fails to mention the planned blood work (titres/serology) and the specific plan to consult with a supervising physician, which are key components of the clinical plan in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the clinical plan. It includes tick identification, physical exam, and antibiotics. However, it misses the blood work, the physician consultation/supervision detail, and the preventive advice requested specifically in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a negative (stating the doctor did not provide advice) which contradicts the transcript. The transcript in D-18 contains the exact preventive advice the Generated Answer says is missing. Other sections correctly cite the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address all parts of the question but fails significantly on the 'preventive advice' portion, which was explicitly requested in the prompt. By stating the advice wasn't given, it fails to be fully relevant to the specific inquiry."
