  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript ends at turn [P-23] and that the next steps cannot be determined. In reality, the provided transcript continues until turn [D-38], and turn [D-37] explicitly outlines the next steps, including consulting with another doctor and discussing potential tests.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include any of the key points from the Gold Answer, such as the involvement of the attending doctor, the plan to return shortly, or the mention of potential diagnostic tests.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination regarding the length and content of the source transcript. It claims the text ends abruptly when the full text was provided, leading it to fabricate the conclusion that the information is unavailable.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question because it wrongly asserts that the information required to answer it is missing from the source text."
