  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the patient is on an unnamed statin for cholesterol and cannot recall which one (matches [P-15]). It accurately reports the physician’s plan to use prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72 hours attachment risk and to prevent Lyme disease (matches [D-6], consistent with [D-13]). It accurately includes the past tick bite history with bullseye rash treated with antibiotics (matches [P-3]). No contradictory or incorrect medication/treatment details were introduced; “course of antibiotics” is slightly more specific than the transcript (no duration given) but not clearly false given the plan to start antibiotics.",
    "completeness": "Key points included: (1) current statin therapy (unnamed), (2) proposed prophylactic antibiotics for the current tick bite, (3) past antibiotics for prior tick bite.\nKey points missed from the Gold Answer: (1) denial of allergies/no drug allergies ([P-16], [P-17]); (2) plan to send the tick to the lab for species identification ([D-6], [D-18]); (3) possible blood work/serology (“titres”) for Lyme disease ([D-18]); (4) plan to consult the supervising physician before finalizing ([D-13], [D-22]); (5) environmental prevention suggestion (consider insecticide) ([D-18]); (6) explicit note that no specific antibiotic name/dose/duration was provided.\nOverall coverage is partial (~50–70% of Gold key items).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript citations provided. No clear hallucinations (e.g., no named antibiotic, no invented dosing). The only minor overreach is implying a defined “course” of antibiotics when the duration wasn’t specified, but the intent to start antibiotics is clearly present.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on medications and treatments discussed (statin, antibiotics) and includes relevant past treatment history. It does not add irrelevant tangents. It does omit other treatments/plans discussed (tick testing, bloodwork, prevention), but what is included is directly responsive to the question."
