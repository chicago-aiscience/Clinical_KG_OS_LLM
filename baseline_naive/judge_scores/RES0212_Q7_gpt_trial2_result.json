  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors compared with the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states the cough began ~1 month ago, whereas the transcript/Gold Answer indicate initial onset ~3 months ago (dry/intermittent) [P-2, P-13]. It also fails to state the timing of when sputum production began (should be ~3 days before presentation [P-12]) and incorrectly claims there is no mention of subjective fever, despite the patient reporting feeling “hot at night in the past couple days” [P-4]. The sleep-disruption timing (~last month, nightly) is broadly consistent with the transcript [P-19, P-21].",
    "completeness": "Key required timeline elements are missing or incorrect: (1) initial onset at ~3 months (missed/incorrect), (2) evolution as intermittent/dry for ~2 months (missing), (3) nightly sleep disruption beginning ~1 month ago (included but incompletely specified as “nightly/pretty well every night”), (4) productive greenish sputum starting ~3 days ago (color included, timing missing), and (5) subjective fevers in the last couple of days (missed and explicitly denied). Overall, it captures only a minority of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: the claim that the cough has been present for ~one month misreads [P-19] and ignores [P-2, P-13] where she reports a 3-month history. The statement that no subjective fever is mentioned directly contradicts [P-4]. While some cited quotations are real, the conclusions drawn from them are inconsistent with the transcript; thus multiple unfaithful assertions are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the requested cough timeline (onset, sleep disruption, sputum, fever) without major tangents, but due to errors/omissions it only partially fulfills the question."
