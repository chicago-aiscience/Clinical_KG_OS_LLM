  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer and transcript regarding laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG), imaging (chest X-ray), and therapeutics (steroids, antibiotics, bronchodilators, oxygen).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two points mentioned in the gold answer: 1) The specific timeframe for the COVID-19 swab results (24-48 hours), and 2) The inclusion of blood pressure monitoring as part of the management plan (discussed in D-37). It covers the core COPD exacerbation plan well but lacks these secondary details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and include accurate speaker citations (e.g., [D-52], [P-11]).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, following the requested structure (Labs, Imaging, Monitoring, Therapeutics) without including unnecessary information."
