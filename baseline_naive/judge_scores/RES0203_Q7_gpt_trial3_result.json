  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states that loss of smell, loss of taste, and dry cough began about two days prior and implies simultaneous onset, which matches the transcript and Gold Answer. However, it contains major inaccuracies: (1) it claims the transcript does not provide information on worsening/fluctuation, but the patient explicitly says both sensory symptoms and cough were “pretty consistent” and the cough had not gotten worse. (2) it says there is no mention of similar symptoms in the past, whereas the patient explicitly denies any prior similar episodes (“No, no, nothing like this.”). These errors contradict key elements of the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: simultaneous onset ~2 days before visit. Key points missed: explicit confirmation cough started at same time; explicit report that taste/smell symptoms were consistent (not on/off); explicit report cough was consistent and not worsening; partial nature of smell/taste loss (can smell very strong odors, taste very salty foods but not normal flavors); explicit denial of prior similar symptoms. Overall, it captures only a small portion of the requested symptom trajectory.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (onset, mild dry cough), but the answer is not faithful in two important places: it asserts absence of information about fluctuation/worsening and prior similar symptoms when the transcript explicitly provides both. These are not merely missing details; they conflict with the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked symptom timeline (onset, progression, prior history) and does not introduce irrelevant material. However, it fails to correctly address progression and prior history, which reduces how well it serves the question, though topical relevance remains high."
