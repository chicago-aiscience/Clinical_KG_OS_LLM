  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and correctly states that the test was negative, consistent with the patient’s statement “I have had the covid test and I don't have it” [P-35]. It also accurately references the persistent two-week cough and that it is now dry [P-2, P-5]. No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) COVID-19 was investigated; (2) investigation was prompted by persistent cough and hospital-worker status/possible exposure; (3) testing was negative.\nKey points missed from the Gold Answer: flu-like/viral URI symptoms prompting concern (sore throat/runny nose) [P-13, P-14]; occupational/social pressure (coworkers scared when she coughs) [P-35]; PPE detail [P-17]; timing of test at symptom onset about two weeks ago and staying home awaiting symptom resolution [P-36]. Overall, it captures the core but omits multiple specific pieces of evidence and the timing/context of testing.",
    "faithfulness": "All included clinical claims are grounded in the transcript: two-week cough [P-2], dry cough [P-5], hospital worker [P-34], and negative COVID test [P-35]. The statement that being a hospital worker “may heighten suspicion” is a reasonable inference and not a fabricated fact. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested elements: diagnosis investigated, what prompted it, and what testing showed. No meaningful tangents."
