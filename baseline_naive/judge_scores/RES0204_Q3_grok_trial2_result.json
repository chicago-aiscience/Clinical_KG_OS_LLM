  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details present symptoms (dry cough 4-5 days non-improving, clear runny nose), extensive pertinent negatives (no fever/chills, sore throat, anosmia, chest pain, muscle pain, etc.), no sick contacts/travel, family asthma hx, novelty/persistence despite absent high-acuity signs leading to X-ray, and COVID as standard protocol. Generated covers core symptoms (dry cough, clear runny nose) and quotes rationales accurately but misattributes X-ray partly to family hx/asthma (loose connection; Gold notes but emphasizes persistence/absents), omits detailed absents' role, adds unmentioned pneumonia, references non-existent 'knowledge graph'; minor discrepancies, core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: present symptoms w/duration/non-improving/cites (partial cover), clear runny nose w/cites (covered), multiple specific negatives (no fever/chills, sore throat, taste/smell, chest/muscle pain, etc.; not covered), no contacts/travel (missed), family hx (briefly covered), novelty/persistent despite absents (missed), X-ray rationale/quote (covered), COVID protocol/quote (covered). Covers ~60% (symptoms partial, rationales; misses absents, context).",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms/cites [D5,11,12,1] verifiable; family hx inquiry verifiable [D28+] but 'linked to asthma in knowledge graph' hallucinates KG (not in transcript); X-ray quote [D37] accurate; COVID quote [D39] accurate; 'rule out pneumonia' plausible but not in transcript; 'anatomical lung issues' inferred not direct; multiple minor unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly explains symptom-driven rationales for both tests w/quotes, addressing 'how led to orders'; focuses on presents but question specifies 'present and absent findings' (absents underemphasized, not tied in); minor tangents (KG, exam, pneumonia)."
