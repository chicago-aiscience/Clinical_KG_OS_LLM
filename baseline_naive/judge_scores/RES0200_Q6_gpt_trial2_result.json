  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s plan in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG; chest X-ray; oxygen saturation measurement with supplemental oxygen if needed; continuation of bronchodilators; addition of steroids and antibiotics; and a COVID swab. No clear contradictions with the Gold Answer are present. Minor wording differences (e.g., calling the COVID swab a monitoring procedure rather than a test) do not change the factual content.",
    "completeness": "It includes the main elements from [D-52] (all listed labs, chest X-ray, O2 sat monitoring with oxygen as needed, bronchodilator continuation, steroids, antibiotics, COVID swab). It omits two details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the COVID swab turnaround time of 24–48 hours, and (2) the additional note about ongoing blood pressure monitoring from [D-37] (included in Gold Answer as an additional monitoring consideration).",
    "faithfulness": "All included items are supported by the transcript, primarily [D-52] and the patient’s existing inhalers in [P-11]. There are no substantial hallucinations. The statement that the chest X-ray is to “assess the exacerbation” is a reasonable interpretation but not explicitly stated; still, the order itself is explicitly in [D-52].",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by organizing the plan into labs, imaging, monitoring, and therapies (steroids, antibiotics, oxygen, bronchodilators). No notable irrelevant content."
