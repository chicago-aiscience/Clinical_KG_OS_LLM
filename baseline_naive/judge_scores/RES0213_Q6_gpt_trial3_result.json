  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states there are no concluding remarks / no plan because the transcript “ends with [P-28]” and contains no further doctor dialogue. In fact, the transcript includes [D-33], where the doctor states the plan to pass the information to another doctor for evaluation. This is a major contradiction to the Gold Answer.\n\nFor the clinical information gathered, several elements are correct (sharp chest pain worse with deep breath, ~20-minute episodes, OTC meds tried without relief, father had MI in 50s, smoking reduction, multivitamin only, stress), but it contains an important factual error: it claims the patient last saw a doctor about “this issue” ~8 years ago; the transcript indicates this was about anxiety attacks, not chest pain ([P-21]).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points included: pleuritic/sharp pain duration (~1.5 weeks) and episode length (~20 min), some situational triggers (studying/walking), OTC meds tried, family history (father MI), smoking history, stress context, and current meds (multivitamin).\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (1) the actual stated plan at end of consult (handoff to another doctor) and that no diagnosis/tests/meds were given; (2) several symptom-defining details: occurs at rest, relieved by distraction/when talking to others, not worsened by exercise; (3) many pertinent negatives: no trauma, no fever/illness, no asthma, no baseline dyspnea, no palpitations except anxiety, no sudden death/arrhythmias in family; (4) psychosocial detail that she lives alone; (5) more precise smoking history (previously ~10/day for 2 years, now ~5/day).",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple issues are not grounded in the transcript: the claim that the transcript ends at [P-28] and lacks concluding doctor dialogue is directly false (there is [D-33]). The statement about last seeing a doctor “about this issue” is not supported; it was about anxiety attacks. The “Knowledge Graph confirms…” note is extraneous and not supported by the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer partially addresses the question by summarizing some gathered clinical information, but it fails to provide the plan (despite it being present in the transcript) and introduces irrelevant content (the Knowledge Graph note). Therefore it is only partially responsive."
