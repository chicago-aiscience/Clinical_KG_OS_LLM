  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis (COVID-19), the general evidence (persistent cough and hospital employment), and the result (negative). These facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer. It does not mention the specific 'initial flu-like symptoms' (sore throat, runny nose) that were part of the evidence, nor does it mention the social/occupational pressure (coworkers being scared) or the specific timing of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset). It covers about 60-70% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical claims are grounded in the transcript. The Generated Answer correctly cites specific patient turns (P-2, P-5, P-35). It mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided, but this meta-commentary does not detract from the faithfulness of the extracted clinical information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused and directly addresses the three parts of the question: diagnosis, evidence, and results."
