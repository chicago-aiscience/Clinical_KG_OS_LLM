  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer regarding the present symptoms (dry cough, runny nose) and the justification for the diagnostic tests (X-ray for visualization, COVID swab for protocol).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to address a key part of the question: the 'absent findings' (pertinent negatives). The gold answer explicitly lists the absence of fever, chills, sore throat, loss of taste/smell, chest pain, and muscle aches as part of the clinical reasoning. The generated answer ignores these negatives entirely, focusing only on the present symptoms and family history.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript. All citations (D-5, D-11, D-12, D-37, D-39) are accurate and the rationale provided (standard protocol and internal visualization) is directly supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant as it explains the diagnostic workup. However, because it ignores the 'absent findings' aspect specifically requested in the prompt, it only partially addresses the 'how' of the clinical reasoning process described in the question."
