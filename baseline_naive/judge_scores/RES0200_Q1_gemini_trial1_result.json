  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains major factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not describe changes in sputum character, whereas the patient specifically mentions a change from clear/white to yellow (P-6). It also incorrectly states the patient did not endorse chills, which the patient did mention (P-29). It fails to note the denial of hemoptysis (P-7) and chest discomfort (P-13).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses almost all key details required by the prompt. It fails to identify the specific sputum color change requested, misses the systemic symptoms of chest discomfort and chills, and overlooks the vast majority of pertinent negatives listed in the Gold Answer (calf pain, dizziness, etc.).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains significant hallucinations by omission and false claims. It explicitly asserts that the transcript does not contain information about sputum character or hemoptysis, both of which are clearly present and discussed in the source text.",
    "relevance": "While the generated answer attempts to follow the structure of the question, it fails to provide the specific information requested (the character of sputum change) and provides incorrect information regarding the symptoms denied and endorsed."
