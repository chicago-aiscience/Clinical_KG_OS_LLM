  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely inconsistent with the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly mention chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea—these are explicitly asked and denied in the transcript (runny nose/congestion D-10/P-10; nausea/vomiting D-15/P-15; chest pain D-16/P-16; fast heartbeat/palpitations D-17/P-17). It also incorrectly identifies “cough” as the main explicitly negated symptom; the patient did not clearly deny cough, instead reporting a possible developing dry cough (P-8). The answer further misattributes content to D-36 and introduces unsupported elements (e.g., “knowledge graph,” “DIAGNOSIS: covid”) not present in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key pertinent negatives in the Gold Answer largely missing: runny nose/congestion; vision/hearing changes; nausea/vomiting; chest pain; palpitations; abdominal pain; urinary symptoms; numbness/tingling. The Generated Answer captures essentially none of these correctly and does not explain their diagnostic value as specified (cardiac vs GI vs neuro vs URI differentiation) in a grounded way. Overall coverage is far below 20% of Gold Answer points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple ungrounded/hallucinated claims: repeated references to a “knowledge graph,” explicit labeling of “DIAGNOSIS: covid,” and the assertion that certain symptoms were not mentioned when they were. It also mischaracterizes cough as “explicitly negated.” These issues indicate substantial lack of grounding in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to address the question (symptoms negated and how they differentiate diagnosis), but because it misses the actual negated symptoms and provides incorrect/ungrounded reasoning, it only partially addresses the prompt."
