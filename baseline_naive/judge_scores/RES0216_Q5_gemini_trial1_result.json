  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the history of asthma, the current symptoms (chest tightness, difficulty breathing), and the lack of a rescue inhaler. However, it fails to explicitly address the 'skipping the evening dose' part of the prompt, which is a key clinical detail present in both the transcript [P-19] and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The response misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific detail about reducing maintenance inhaler from twice-daily to morning-only (skipping the evening dose). 2) The additional symptoms of increased phlegm and hoarseness [P-11]. 3) The patient's observation that this feels 'different' than past episodes [P-16].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer repeatedly cites a 'Knowledge Graph' [KG] as a source for its claims. This 'Knowledge Graph' is not part of the provided source transcript, constituting a hallucination of external data or a non-existent source. While the underlying clinical claims are generally grounded in the transcript, the attribution is incorrect.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the relationship between the patient's asthma history, medication habits, and current symptoms as requested by the prompt."
