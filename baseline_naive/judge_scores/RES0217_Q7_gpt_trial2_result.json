  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the key sequence (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertain attachment time, removed tick and brought it in, clinician estimated >72h and considered prophylactic antibiotics) and the prior episode (~10 years ago) with bullseye/target rash and antibiotics.\n\nMinor inaccuracies/imprecision:\n- It implies the *bite site* was “a little bit swollen,” whereas the transcript focuses on local redness/tenderness and discusses *tick engorgement* (swollen tick) rather than swelling of the skin.\n- It states the current site is “more sore,” but the patient’s comparison is that the current episode “was just kind of sore in one spot” and she “didn’t think it…was as bad as that time.”\n\nOverall, core facts align but with a couple minor distortions in symptom comparison/wording.",
    "completeness": "Major Gold Answer points covered: Friday hiking + Saturday gardening; uncertainty about where/when acquired; discovery prompted by soreness; brought tick in container; clinician estimated >72 hours; prior episode had bullseye rash and antibiotics; prior tick was more engorged/swollen.\n\nKey elements missed or under-specified vs Gold Answer:\n- Hiking location (Strathroy) not mentioned.\n- The “earlier today” timing of discovery is not explicitly stated in the timeline section.\n- The strong contrast that the current tick was “pretty small” (and the doctor’s ‘little grape’ engorgement comparison) is not included.\n- The explicit statement that there is *no current bullseye/larger circle rash* is not clearly included (only indirectly suggested).\n\nNet: substantial but not complete coverage of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (Friday hike, Saturday gardening, uncertainty, container, >72h estimate, prior target rash and antibiotics, prior tick quite swollen).\n\nPotentially ungrounded/slightly altered details:\n- “Area is only a little bit swollen” is not stated; redness/tenderness is stated, and ‘swollen’ primarily refers to the tick in the transcript.\n- “More sore” is not supported and arguably contradicts the patient’s statement that this episode was not as bad.\n\nThese are limited; the answer is largely grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what was asked: the timeline from Friday/Saturday exposure through discovery/presentation and the comparison to the prior tick bite’s local symptoms and engorgement. No notable tangents."
