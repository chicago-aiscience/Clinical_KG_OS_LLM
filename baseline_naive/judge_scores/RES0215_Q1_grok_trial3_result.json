  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the respiratory symptoms from the transcript (wheezy, short of breath, slight cough, difficulty taking deep breaths, out of breath, hard time catching breath), matching most of the Gold Answer's descriptions with correct citations. However, it incorrectly identifies only 'wheezy' as the earliest symptom based on [P-1] timeline, while the Gold Answer correctly notes both 'wheezy' and 'difficulty taking deep breaths' as earliest per direct response in [P-2]. It omits non-productive cough and 'looks fine otherwise.' Core facts are correct with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covers key symptoms: wheezy [P-1,P-2], short of breath [P-1], cough now [P-1], out of breath [P-3], hard time catching breath [P-32], difficulty deep breaths [P-2] (all from Gold). Partially covers earliest symptoms (only wheezy, misses pairing with difficulty deep breaths). Misses cough non-productive [P-31] and 'looks fine' [P-9]. Covers ~85-90% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All listed symptoms and citations (P-1, P-2, P-3, P-32) are directly verifiable in transcript. Minor unverifiable detail: reference to 'knowledge graph' and its associations, which is not present in the source transcript (hallucinated addition). No other fabrications; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing specific symptoms reported at presentation with citations and identifying earliest symptom (wheezy) with timeline explanation. Structured response is focused; minor tangent on knowledge graph does not detract significantly."
