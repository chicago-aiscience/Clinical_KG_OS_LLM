  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims that no negative findings were documented, when in fact the transcript explicitly shows the doctor asking about and the patient denying multiple symptoms: fevers [D-10, P-10], difficulty breathing [D-11, P-11], headaches [D-12, P-12], sore throat [D-13, P-13], chills/night sweats [D-14, P-14], muscle aches/weakness [D-15, P-15], and chest pain [D-22, P-22]. The Generated Answer directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the core question. It lists only the positive findings (loss of taste, loss of smell, dry cough) but completely omits the systematic review of negative findings that the question specifically asks for. It covers 0% of the key negative findings detailed in the Gold Answer (no fever, no dyspnea, no headaches, no sore throat, no chills, no night sweats, no muscle aches, no chest pain, etc.). It also fails to explain how these absences informed the clinical picture.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a major factual error by claiming that negative findings are 'not documented' when they are clearly present in the transcript. The statements in D-10 through D-22 explicitly show the doctor screening for and the patient denying multiple symptoms. This represents a fundamental misreading of the source material. However, the positive findings mentioned are accurate to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question by discussing the clinical picture and positive findings, but it fundamentally fails to answer what was asked: the systematic screening for and confirmation of absent symptoms. Instead of listing the negative findings as requested, it incorrectly claims they don't exist. The focus on positive findings alone is off-target for this specific question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misinterprets the source transcript by claiming that no negative findings were documented, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor systematically screening for and the patient denying multiple symptoms (fever, dyspnea, headaches, sore throat, chills, night sweats, muscle aches, chest pain). This represents a critical factual error that makes the answer incorrect and incomplete. While it accurately identifies the positive findings, it fails entirely to address the core question about negative findings and their clinical significance. The response demonstrates poor faithfulness to the source material and limited relevance to the specific question asked."
