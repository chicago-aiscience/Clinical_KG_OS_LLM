  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims that only patient dialogue (P-1 through P-23) is present and that doctor's responses are absent, when in fact the transcript clearly shows doctor segments D-1 through D-48, including the critical D-47 and D-48 where the plan and assessment are stated. The Generated Answer fabricates information not in the transcript (e.g., 'one month' duration when the patient said 'three months', incorrect numbering of segments). This represents a fundamental misreading of the source material and contradicts the Gold Answer entirely.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to identify: (1) the doctor's plan to review with supervising doctors, (2) the summary assessment of cough worsening over 3 days with greenish sputum and no constitutional symptoms, (3) that next steps would be guided by the supervising physician's assessment. Instead, it incorrectly claims this information cannot be extracted.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations and misrepresentations. It falsely claims doctor dialogue is absent when D-1 through D-48 are clearly present in the transcript. It fabricates a 'one month' duration when the transcript states 'three months' [P-2]. It invents 'knowledge graph' content not present in the source material. The claim that the answer 'cannot be extracted' is itself unfaithful to the clearly available source content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question. Instead of providing the requested information about the doctor's plan, assessment, and guidance for next steps (which are present in D-47 and D-48), it incorrectly claims this information is unavailable and provides tangential clinical observations that do not answer what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misreads the source transcript, incorrectly claiming that doctor dialogue is absent when it is clearly present throughout (D-1 to D-48). This leads to a complete failure to answer the question. The response contains multiple factual errors (wrong duration, fabricated details) and hallucinated content (knowledge graph references). It provides 0% coverage of the Gold Answer's key points and does not address what was asked. All evaluation dimensions score at the lowest level due to these critical failures."
