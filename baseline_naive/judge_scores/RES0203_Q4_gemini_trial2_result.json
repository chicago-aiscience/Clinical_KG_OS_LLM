  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It states that there are no documented negative findings for fever, dyspnea, or sore throat in the transcript. However, the transcript explicitly includes these: fever [D-10, P-10], difficulty breathing/dyspnea [D-11, P-11], and sore throat [D-13, P-13]. It also misses all other negative findings listed in the Gold Answer, such as no headaches, no chest pain, and no sputum.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to provide any of the negative findings requested by the prompt. It focuses only on positive findings (loss of taste/smell, dry cough), which were not the primary focus of the question. It misses 100% of the key points regarding systematic screening and negative results.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the transcript 'does not include the patient's answers' regarding the absence of symptoms. This is a direct contradiction of the provided text where the patient clearly responds 'no' to several screening questions.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer does not address the question. Instead of listing negative findings, it claims they do not exist and lists positive findings instead, which fails to meet the user's specific request."
