  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition ruled out and the 'covid-19 test' as the specific test used, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-35]. However, it contains a significant factual error by claiming the transcript 'does not explicitly specify' the timing of the test relative to symptom onset, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and explicit statement in [P-36] ('I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago'). Additionally, workplace concerns are severely underrepresented (only 'coworkers scared' [P-35]), missing key details like hospital clerk role [P-34], PPE use [P-17], staying home, desire to return without coughing, and medication request [P-36, P-35], which are emphasized in Gold. The addition of 'Knowledge Graph' is extraneous and inaccurate relative to Gold/transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 ruled out (covered); (2) 'covid test' negative [P-35] (covered); (3) test at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior [P-36] (not covered, wrongly dismissed); (4) workplace concerns: hospital clerk [P-34], PPE [P-17], coworkers scared [P-35], staying home post-test, eagerness to return cough-free, med desire [P-36, P-35] (only coworkers scared covered, ~20% of concerns). Overall, covers condition and test (~50%), but misses timing fully and most concerns (<20-49% total key points).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about condition and test are verifiable [P-35]; cough duration verifiable [P-2]. Timing claim ('does not explicitly specify') is unverifiable and false, as [P-36] explicitly states test timing; coworkers scared verifiable [P-35]. 'Knowledge Graph' reference is hallucinated/not in transcript. Citations accurate where used, but interpretation error on timing and addition of ungrounded KG make it partially ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured with bullets directly matching the four question elements (condition, test, timing, concerns), staying focused on the query without major off-topic content; minor tangent in KG reference."
