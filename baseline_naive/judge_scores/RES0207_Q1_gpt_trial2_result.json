  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All elements stated in the Generated Answer are consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer: sudden shortness of breath [P-1], seizure last night [P-8], and a measured temperature of 37.4 [P-5]. No incorrect or contradictory claims are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: shortness of breath, seizure, and the numeric fever measurement (37.4). Key points missed that are required by the question/Gold for 'specific respiratory symptoms' and fever measurement context: the cough that began suddenly that morning and that it was dry/no sputum [P-2, P-4]; timing detail (~3 hours) [P-11]; epilepsy history [P-8]; and that the temperature was measured that morning and was in °C [P-5, P-6]. (Pertinent negatives in the Gold Answer were also omitted, though less essential to the question.)",
    "faithfulness": "All reported items (SOB, seizure, 37.4) are directly supported by the transcript with correct citations. No hallucinated symptoms or measurements.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on respiratory and neurologic symptoms and the objective fever measurement, with no tangential content."
