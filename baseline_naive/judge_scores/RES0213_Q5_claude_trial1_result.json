  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all three key factors: family history (father's heart attack in 50s), smoking history (10 cigarettes/day reduced to 5), and psychosocial stressors (Masters thesis deadline). The citations are accurate and the core facts align with the Gold Answer. However, it adds some interpretive elements not explicitly in the Gold Answer, such as the 'feedback loop of anxiety' and the connection to not seeing a doctor in 8 years due to family worry, which is somewhat speculative.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: father's heart attack while 'pretty young' in his 50s, smoking history with specific cigarette counts and reduction efforts, and psychosocial stressors including thesis pressure and living alone. It includes the key quotes showing the patient's explicit worry [P-8], anxiety about symptoms [P-19], and potential return of anxiety attacks [P-22]. The only minor omission is the specific detail about the paternal grandfather dying young in an accident with unknown cardiac history.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The patient does say her father had a heart attack and it scares her [P-8], she describes her smoking history [P-14, P-18], and she details her thesis stress [P-15, P-16]. The citations [P-3][P-4][P-6][P-8][P-21][P-28] are accurate. However, the interpretation that she 'hasn't seen a doctor in eight years...likely due to this lingering family worry' [P-21] is an inference not explicitly stated in the transcript—she simply says she hasn't seen a doctor for anxiety in 8 years.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the question: how each factor contributes to her concern, how they interact, and what details illustrate these connections. The structure is clear with sections for each factor and a synthesis section. However, the organizational framework (Mechanism of Concern, Illustrative Evidence) adds complexity beyond what was asked, and some explanatory content goes beyond simply answering the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates strong correctness with accurate identification of all three key factors and proper citations, though it includes some interpretive elements beyond the Gold Answer. Completeness is high, covering nearly all key points except minor details about the grandfather. Faithfulness is generally good with verifiable claims, but contains one questionable inference about why the patient hasn't seen a doctor. Relevance is excellent as it directly addresses all parts of the question with clear organization and specific examples from the consultation."
