  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately cites transcript details like father's HA 'last year' in 50s, now seeing heart doctors [P-8,P-30], scares patient [P-8], grandpa accident [P-30]; detailed smoking history from age 18, peak 10/day 2 years, now 5/day [P-13,14,18]; stressors including Masters thesis deadline [P-15,16], living alone [P-26,27], nervous about running [P-28], connections to stress/anxiety [P-8,19,22]. Generated mostly matches core facts on three factors contributing to concern, but has errors: attributes not seeing doctor 8 years to family worry (P-21 is about anxiety); falsely links smoking directly in P-8 (smoking mentioned later); misquotes P-28 coping (says reading school books instead of relaxing, opposite of transcript; running 'for anxiety' inferred but not explicit). Adds external 'knowledge graph' not in Gold or transcript. Main points correct despite some errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: FH details (HA last year 50s, heart doctors, scares, grandpa); smoking details (start age, peak, current, hard quit); stressors (thesis crunch, live alone, nervous running); interactions (stress possible, nervous breathing, past anxiety). Generated covers FH (father 50s, scares [P8], misses last year/heart doctors/grandpa); smoking (current 5, quit attempt [P14], misses full history); stressors (studying/walking triggers [P4], academic pressure, running [P28 misquoted], misses thesis/live alone/past anxiety specifics); interactions (feedback loop with pain, family, smoking). Covers core categories and some interactions (80%+), misses granular details like citations/timing.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: FH [P8], smoking [P14], pain triggers [P4,P3], synthesis pain details [P6]. Hallucinations/misquotes: 'knowledge graph' KG links not in transcript; 8-year doctor gap 'due to family worry' (P21 about anxiety); P28 'read school books rather than relaxing' (actual: relaxing books instead of school); running 'for anxiety' (enjoys running to manage stress, nervous lately); direct smoking link in P8 (not there). Multiple minor unverifiable additions and misattributions.",
    "relevance": "Generated perfectly structures response around the three specified factors (FH, smoking, stressors), their mechanisms/contributions to heart disease concern, illustrative transcript details/cites, and explicit synthesis of interactions/feedback loop, directly mirroring question without off-topic content."
