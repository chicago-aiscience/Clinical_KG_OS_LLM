  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient tried no self-treatments, aligning with Gold's citation of [D-9, P-9] and [D-24, P-24], though it does not explicitly mention no regular medications or that no medication was prescribed. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test and self-isolation instructions with details matching [D-39], but omits the timeline for results ('a day or two'), potential other tests, and consultation with the supervising doctor. Core facts are consistent with no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: no self-treatments (main point, though misses explicit no regular meds), COVID-19 swab test, and detailed self-isolation instructions. Misses: explicit no regular medications [D-24, P-24], no medication prescribed, results timeline, other potential tests, and consulting supervising doctor [D-40]. Approximately 80% coverage of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims (no self-treatment, swab test [D-39], self-isolation details [D-39]) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. Minor unverifiable addition: reference to 'Knowledge Graph' and its association with COVID diagnosis, which is not present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question with sections on patient's self-treatment and doctor's recommendations, including the specific intervention (swab test) and instructions (self-isolation), with no significant off-topic content."
