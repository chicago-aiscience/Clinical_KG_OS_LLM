  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually inconsistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It incorrectly states that the environmental triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) are “absent from the provided transcript,” even though they are explicitly described by the patient (exercise and cold in P-9; winter/cold and spring/pollen in P-11). It also incorrectly claims there is “no specific transcript evidence” of suspicion of undiagnosed allergies, despite the clinician directly asking about allergies after the pollen trigger (D-12) and agreeing it “would make sense” when the patient reports suspected but undiagnosed allergies (P-12, D-13). While it correctly notes the patient’s cough, shortness of breath, wheeze, and increased bronchodilator use, these do not compensate for the major contradictions about triggers/allergies that are central to the question.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed or contradicted: (1) all three identified triggers and their timing/seasonality; (2) the pollen trigger prompting the clinician’s allergy question and the patient’s lack of formal diagnosis; (3) family history: sister with asthma and lack of other family allergies; (4) linkage of triggers/family history to the current exacerbation and escalated rescue inhaler use (from ~q2 weeks to 5–6x/week) and the implication that rescue-only therapy is insufficient. The Generated Answer covers only a subset of symptom details and family history, and omits/denies the trigger–allergy linkage that the question asks about.",
    "faithfulness": "Some statements are grounded (dry cough P-1/P-14, SOB P-1, wheeze P-15, bronchodilator use increase P-1/P-8, sister has asthma P-32). However, it contains multiple ungrounded elements (“knowledge graph,” bracket tags like [SYMPTOM]/[TREATMENT]) and, more importantly, directly contradicts transcript content by claiming triggers and allergy suspicion are not present. These contradictions and extra-framework references reduce faithfulness substantially.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks how the three triggers plus sister’s asthma history relate to the current exacerbation and the doctor’s suspicion of undiagnosed allergies. The Generated Answer largely sidesteps this by asserting the trigger information is absent and focuses instead on general symptom description and infection rule-out, making it only partially aligned with the asked causal/interpretive linkage."
