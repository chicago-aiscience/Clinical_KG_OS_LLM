  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims there is no information in the transcript about Jessica's family history (father's allergies [P-33], cousin's asthma [P-30]), brother's recent cold [P-39], or living situation on a farm with home-schooling [P-41-P-43, P-44], directly contradicting the Gold Answer and the source transcript which explicitly contains these details. It also introduces a 'Knowledge Graph' and 'common cold' diagnosis not present in the transcript, further deviating from factual accuracy compared to the Gold Answer's grounded explanation.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer (family history of allergies/asthma, allergies not yet in season [P-16/P-17], brother's cold as viral source ~2 weeks prior [P-39/D-58], isolated farm life/home-schooling reducing external exposures [P-41-P-46], only dog on farm [P-48]) are entirely missed; Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead listing unrelated symptoms and hallucinated diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates absence of key transcript details (e.g., denies family history, exposures despite [P-30], [P-33], [P-39], [P-41-P-44]); unverifiable 'Knowledge Graph' and 'common cold' diagnosis; attributes post-nasal drip to allergies without context; largely fabricated by ignoring/denying transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically how listed factors (family history, brother's cold, farm/home-schooling) relate to symptoms; Generated Answer dismisses these factors as absent and pivots to symptom description and unrelated diagnosis, failing to address the query."
