  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains factual errors and incomplete information. It correctly identifies blood-tinged sputum ('little spots of red') and right-sided chest pain, but misses critical details. The sputum description is incomplete - it fails to mention the 'yellow custard' appearance explicitly stated in P-6. The chest pain quality is incorrectly characterized: the answer states it 'gets worse with coughing and deep breathing' but omits that it's constant, dull, and present even at rest (P-20, P-21). The fever description is vague ('feeling fever') when the Gold Answer specifies subjective fevers starting Monday without temperature measurement (P-8). The answer also completely omits several key symptoms: dyspnea on exertion, sore throat, resolved runny nose, and the important negative finding of no weight loss.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It identifies: (1) blood-tinged sputum, (2) right-sided chest pain, (3) fever, and (4) chills. However, it misses: (1) complete sputum description ('yellow custard'), (2) timeline of cough progression (raspy Friday, severe Sunday), (3) pain being constant/dull and present at rest, (4) fever timeline (started Monday, persisted through visit day), (5) dyspnea on exertion with specific details, (6) sore throat after coughing, (7) resolved runny nose from week prior, and (8) pertinent negative of no weight loss. The answer provides basic symptom identification but lacks the comprehensive detail present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. All claims reference specific patient statements (P-4, P-5, P-9, P-17, P-19). However, there's a minor issue with the phrase 'feeling fever' which is somewhat imprecise compared to the actual transcript where the patient said 'I started getting fever' and 'felt hot' (P-5, P-8). The mention of 'knowledge graph' in the opening is unexplained and potentially fabricated as no knowledge graph is provided in the source material. While the core information is verifiable, the incomplete nature means important verifiable details from the transcript are simply omitted rather than hallucinated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's components about symptoms, sputum description, chest pain location/quality, and systemic symptoms. It stays focused on the requested information without tangential content. However, its relevance is diminished by incompleteness - while it addresses all four question components, it does so superficially. The question specifically asks for 'specific symptoms' and 'description' implying thoroughness, which the answer fails to deliver fully. The structure is appropriate and on-topic throughout."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the basic components of the question but suffers from significant incompleteness and some factual imprecision. While it correctly identifies blood-tinged sputum, right-sided chest pain, fever, and chills with accurate citations (scores 4 for faithfulness and relevance), it omits critical descriptive details about sputum appearance, pain characteristics, symptom timeline, and additional symptoms like dyspnea and sore throat. The chest pain characterization is incomplete, missing that it's constant and dull. These omissions result in coverage of only 40-50% of key points from the Gold Answer (score 2 for completeness). The vague fever description and missing symptom details constitute factual gaps affecting correctness (score 2). Overall, the answer provides a skeletal response that touches on main symptom categories but lacks the comprehensive clinical detail present in the Gold Answer."
