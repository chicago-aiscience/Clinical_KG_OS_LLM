  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes the simultaneous onset of all three symptoms approximately two days prior, citing [P-1], which aligns with Gold. However, it inaccurately claims the transcript provides no information on worsening or fluctuation, contradicting explicit statements in [P-5] (sensory symptoms 'pretty consistent') and [P-8] (dry cough 'pretty consistent as well'). It also fails to note the specific confirmation that the dry cough started at the same time [P-6] and overlooks the direct denial of prior similar symptoms [P-3], instead vaguely inferring from [P-1]. These are significant factual discrepancies from Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: simultaneous onset ~2 days (partial); no prior history (incompletely). Missed: explicit confirmation cough same time [P-6]; sensory symptoms consistent/no fluctuation [P-5]; cough consistent/no worsening [P-8]; none intermittent/variable; partial sensory losses persisted [P-4]; doctor's note on COVID consistency [D-39]. Covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: simultaneous onset [P-1]; mild cough [P-1]; COVID concern [P-1,D-39]. Unverifiable/false claims: 'no information regarding worsened or fluctuated' (directly contradicted by [P-5,P-8]); 'no mention of prior symptoms' (explicitly denied in [P-3]). Multiple inaccuracies about transcript content constitute hallucinated absences.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response around onset timeline, progression (even if wrongly claiming absent), and history, matching question's focus on symptom development, relative timing, worsening/fluctuation, and priors; no off-topic content."
