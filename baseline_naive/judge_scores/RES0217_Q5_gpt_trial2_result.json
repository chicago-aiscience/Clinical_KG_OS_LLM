  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly explains the >72-hour estimate using the Friday hiking and Saturday gardening history and accurately quotes the doctor’s statement in [D-6]. However, it is factually incorrect in claiming the transcript contains no information about Strathroy or the Ontario Lyme distribution map. The transcript explicitly includes Strathroy as the hiking location [P-12] and the doctor’s use of the Ontario Lyme map to judge Strathroy as “close enough… a concerning point,” supporting antibiotics [D-13]. This directly contradicts the Generated Answer’s second section.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) patient unsure when tick attached and was outdoors Friday/Saturday; (2) doctor estimated attachment >72 hours and used that to justify prophylactic antibiotics. Key points missed: (1) Strathroy location detail [P-12]; (2) doctor referenced Ontario Lyme disease distribution map; (3) doctor concluded Strathroy was within a concerning area and this geographic risk contributed to moving forward with antibiotics [D-13]. Overall, it covers the timeline rationale but omits/denies the geographic-map justification.",
    "faithfulness": "The first part is grounded in cited transcript lines [P-1], [D-6]. The second part is not faithful: it asserts absence of Strathroy/map discussion, which is directly present in [P-12] and [D-13]. It also references segments like [D-17] as relevant to the map despite the map discussion occurring in [D-13], indicating mismatch/unsupported claims.",
    "relevance": "The response remains focused on tick attachment duration and prophylaxis rationale, but it fails to answer the second half of the question (map-based justification) and instead incorrectly dismisses it. Thus it is only partially responsive to the asked two-part question."
