  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies all OTC agents used for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and accurately states they were not very helpful, matching the gold answer and transcript [P-6]. It also correctly notes the only routine supplement as a multivitamin [P-25]. No contradictory or incorrect claims are made.",
    "completeness": "It covers the key items asked in the question and present in the gold answer: (1) OTC meds tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), (2) their lack of effectiveness (“hasn’t really helped very much”), and (3) routine supplement use (multivitamin). It does not mention the patient takes no other medications, but that point is ancillary to the question as phrased and not required to answer what OTC meds/supplements were taken.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript: OTC meds and lack of benefit [P-6], multivitamin [P-25], and running frequency [P-28]. No hallucinated medications/supplements or effects are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on OTC medications/supplements and effectiveness, which directly answers the question. The mention of running is a minor tangent (not an OTC medication/supplement), but it does not substantially distract from the answer."
