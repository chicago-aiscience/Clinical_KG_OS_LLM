  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the dual diagnosis of COPD exacerbation and respiratory infection as stated by the doctor in D-43. It accurately references the key symptoms: green-yellow sputum [P-1], fever/feeling hot [P-9], worsening dyspnea [P-1], and the causal relationship between infection and COPD worsening. However, it incorrectly attributes information to a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not exist in the source transcript, which is a significant error. The core factual content about symptoms and their relationship to the diagnoses is correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers many key points from the Gold Answer including green-yellow sputum, fever, increased dyspnea, and the doctor's dual assessment. However, it misses several important details present in the Gold Answer: sinus pressure [P-12], headache [P-14], sick contact [P-20], increased cough frequency [P-1], increased sputum volume [P-1], decreased exercise tolerance [P-4], the exclusion of environmental triggers [P-38], medication adherence [P-26], and the patient's recognition of past infection-triggered exacerbations [P-3]. Coverage is approximately 50-60% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a critical faithfulness issue: it repeatedly references a 'Knowledge Graph' (abbreviated as [KG]) that does not exist in the source transcript. This constitutes fabricated citations and hallucinated content. All actual symptom citations ([P-1], [P-9], [D-43]) are accurate and verifiable in the transcript, but the KG references significantly undermine faithfulness. The clinical reasoning itself is grounded in the transcript, but the false attribution severely impacts this score.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying specific symptoms that support the dual diagnosis and explaining how green-yellow sputum and fever help distinguish between infection and COPD exacerbation. It maintains focus throughout on the question's requirements without significant tangents. The structure explicitly addresses both parts of the question: symptoms supporting the dual assessment and how specific findings help distinguish diagnoses."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the dual diagnosis and key distinguishing symptoms (green-yellow sputum, fever) with accurate transcript citations. However, it suffers from significant hallucination by repeatedly referencing a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph,' which severely impacts faithfulness. Additionally, it omits approximately 40-50% of relevant details from the Gold Answer, including sick contact, exercise tolerance changes, environmental exposure assessment, and the patient's historical pattern recognition. Despite these issues, it remains highly relevant and focused on answering the specific question asked."
