  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key medical information from the transcript. The COVID test timeframe (24-48 hours), 14-day isolation recommendation including from the sister, acknowledgment of false negatives, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and specific ER warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms/seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting) all align precisely with statements in D-44. The answer correctly identifies the assessment as COVID-consistent symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components requested: diagnostic test (COVID swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours), isolation period (14 days), alternative diagnosis (another viral illness), false negative possibility, and specific warning signs with examples (high temperature, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting). However, it omits the nuanced detail from D-45 about asthma being considered if only cough/shortness of breath without fever were present, and doesn't explicitly mention the 'watchful waiting' approach or lack of medication prescription.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in D-44. The isolation recommendation, test timeframe, warning signs, and alternative diagnosis statements all have clear citations. There is no fabricated content. The answer stays grounded in what the doctor actually stated without adding unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the multi-part question. It systematically covers the assessment, diagnostic test with timeframe, isolation period, alternative diagnosis considerations, false negative possibility, and warning signs with specific examples. The structure mirrors the question's requirements and maintains focus throughout without tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-grounded response that addresses nearly all aspects of the complex multi-part question. It correctly captures the COVID-19 assessment, test details, isolation recommendations, and specific ER warning signs as stated in D-44. The answer loses only minor points for completeness by omitting the contextual note from D-45 about asthma differential and the watchful waiting approach, but otherwise delivers a comprehensive summary of the doctor's complete management plan."
