  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct based on the transcript. It accurately identifies the presence of blood in the sputum, the location of the chest pain, aggravating factors, and systemic symptoms like fever and chills.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details requested in the prompt and present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the color of the sputum ('yellow custard'), which was explicitly requested ('color and appearance'). It also omits the specific quality of the chest pain ('dull', 'constant'), only mentioning aggravating factors. Furthermore, it leaves out other reported symptoms such as the sore throat, runny nose, and dyspnea on exertion.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, with no hallucinations. All symptoms mentioned are directly supported by the patient's statements.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's categories, although it fails to provide the full level of detail requested in the parenthetical instructions."
