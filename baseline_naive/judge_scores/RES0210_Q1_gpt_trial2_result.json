  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All included symptom statements are consistent with the Gold Answer/transcript: red spots in sputum (blood-tinged) [P-4], right-sided chest pain worsened by coughing/deep breath [P-17, P-19], and subjective fever/feeling off plus chills [P-5, P-9]. However, the answer omits key qualifying details (e.g., sputum color/consistency, chest pain being constant/dull), but what it does state is not factually wrong.",
    "completeness": "Covers only part of the Gold Answer. Included: red spots in sputum; right-sided chest pain with pleuritic features; fever/feeling off; chills. Missed: sputum described as \"yellow custard\" (color/appearance) and that yellow+red appeared simultaneously; chest pain quality (constant, dull, present even at rest/lying down); timeline/persistence of fever and that temperature wasn’t measured; mild dyspnea on exertion; sore/raw throat after coughing; resolved runny nose; pertinent negative of no weight loss. Overall coverage is roughly about half of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are grounded in the transcript and citations provided match the content quoted. No clear hallucinated symptoms or contradictions. The phrase \"knowledge graph\" is extraneous but does not add unsupported clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question domains (sputum, chest pain, systemic symptoms), but it fails to include requested specifics (notably sputum color/appearance and chest pain quality), reducing how well it answers the question in full."
