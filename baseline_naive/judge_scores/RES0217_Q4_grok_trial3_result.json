  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the assessment for bullseye rash (erythema migrans) and its absence, consistent with Gold and transcript (D-6, P-6, also P-3 comparison). However, it inaccurately implies this is the only specific feature assessed by stating 'specifically assessed for the presence of a bullseye rash' and omits others like joint pain (D-7/P-7), fever/illness (D-8/P-8), headaches (D-19/P-19-20), and general wellness/no other bites. For tests, it correctly notes tick to lab (D-6/D-18) but misses blood serology/titres (D-18), physical exam, and physician consult. Citation to P-3 is accurate for patient's description but not the direct response to D-6. Some factual errors and significant underreporting of assessed features.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points on features: bullseye rash (covered), joint pain (missed), fever/illness (missed), headaches (missed), feeling well otherwise (missed), no other bites (missed) → 1/6 covered (~17%). Tests: physical exam (missed), tick species ID (covered), blood serology (missed), physician consult (missed) → 1/4 covered (25%). Overall covers <30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: bullseye assessment in D-6/P-3/P-6; tick lab send in D-6/D-18; prophylactic antibiotics in D-6. P-3 citation accurate for current tick comparison (patient contrasts past/current rash). No hallucinations; minor indirect citation but grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of question with headers for features and tests; no irrelevant content, tangents, or extraneous info; perfectly focused on clinical features and diagnostics from transcript."
