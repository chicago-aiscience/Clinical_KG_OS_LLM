  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all key facts: COVID swab test, 14-day isolation, isolation from younger sister specifically, and return-to-ER precautions including high temperature and neurological symptoms. All statements align with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-44].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main management measures but omits several important details present in the Gold Answer: (1) 24-48 hour timeframe for test results, (2) acknowledgment of possible false negatives, (3) mention of other viral illnesses as differential, (4) statement that doctor would wait for results, (5) no medications prescribed/supportive approach, (6) school requirement for COVID test mentioned by parent [P-41], and (7) complete household composition [P-35]. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-44]. The citation is accurate and specific. The phrase 'distancing from' is a reasonable paraphrase of 'isolate...from' used in the transcript. No hallucinated information is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: diagnostic tests (COVID swab), isolation instructions with duration (14 days), and specific household member to isolate from (younger sister). The addition of return-to-ER precautions is relevant to management measures. No off-topic content present."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate and highly relevant information that directly addresses the question. All claims are well-grounded in the transcript with proper citations. However, it lacks several important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including the timeframe for test results, discussion of false negatives and alternative diagnoses, the supportive care approach, and the school's testing requirement. Despite missing these nuances, the core management recommendations are correctly and completely captured."
