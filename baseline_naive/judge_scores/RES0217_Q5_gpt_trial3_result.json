  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The first part is consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: the patient was outdoors Friday (hiking) and Saturday (gardening) and removed the tick “earlier today,” and the doctor states this implies “longer than at least 72 hours” and supports prophylactic antibiotics (D-6, P-1, D-1). However, the second part is incorrect: the transcript explicitly includes Strathroy (P-12) and the doctor referencing an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map and stating “Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point,” supporting moving forward with antibiotics (D-13). The generated answer wrongly claims there is no such discussion and that justification rested “entirely” on duration.",
    "completeness": "Covers the attachment-duration reasoning and the doctor’s explicit >72-hour estimate and prophylaxis rationale. It omits/denies the entire geographic-risk justification from the Ontario Lyme distribution map and the conclusion to proceed with antibiotics based on Strathroy’s location. Thus it captures only about half of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The first section is well grounded in cited lines (P-1, D-6). The second section contains a major unfaithful claim: it states the transcript lacks Strathroy/map discussion, which directly contradicts P-12 and D-13. It also introduces irrelevant framing (“knowledge graph”) not supported by the transcript. This is a significant grounding failure.",
    "relevance": "It addresses the question’s two components, but the second component is answered incorrectly by denying the relevant transcript content. Still, the response remains on-topic (tick duration and geographic risk), without major tangents."
