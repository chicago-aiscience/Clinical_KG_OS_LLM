  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it explicitly states that the transcript does not contain questions regarding sick contacts, recent travel, or rashes. However, these questions are present in the source transcript at segments [D-10], [D-11], and [D-13] respectively. This error directly impacts the accuracy of the diagnostic reasoning provided.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses half of the specific criteria requested in the prompt. While it addresses fever, runny nose, and phlegm, it fails to explain the medical rationale for screening for sick contacts, travel, and rashes. It also misses the corresponding patient denials for those three categories which were key to narrowing the differential in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The model hallucinates the absence of specific text segments. By claiming the transcript segments for sick contacts, travel, and rashes are missing, it contradicts the provided source material.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant in its attempt to answer the question and provides some good clinical context regarding asthma and exertion, but it is ultimately hindered by its failure to address all parts of the multi-part question."
