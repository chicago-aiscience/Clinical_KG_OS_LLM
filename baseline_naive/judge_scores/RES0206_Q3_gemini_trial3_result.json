  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the dual assessment (COPD exacerbation and infection) and mentions the primary symptoms of green-yellow sputum and fever. However, it fails to include several key supporting facts mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the increased cough frequency, increased sputum volume, decreased exercise tolerance (walking the dog), sinus pressure, headache, and the exclusion of environmental triggers or medication non-adherence.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly less complete than the Gold Answer. It misses approximately 60% of the specific evidence points provided in the Gold Answer, including the patient's history of symptoms being worsened by illness, the specific sick contact, and the exclusion of other triggers like dust or smoke. It focuses only on the most obvious symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains significant hallucinations regarding its source material. It repeatedly cites a 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' which does not exist in the provided transcript. Additionally, it provides medical interpretations (e.g., green-yellow sputum being a 'hallmark of bacterial infection') that are not present in the transcript or the Gold Answer, which is intended to be a summary of the clinical encounter.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant to the question asked, focusing directly on the symptoms and the distinction between the two diagnoses."
