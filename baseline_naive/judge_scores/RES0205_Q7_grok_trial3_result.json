  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the cough onset at two weeks [P-2], initial flu-like symptoms in the first 2-3 days [P-13, P-14], resolution of other symptoms by 3-4 days [P-14], transition to dry cough, and chest soreness [P-15]. However, it inaccurately states the cough transitioned after 2-3 days [P-5], while the transcript specifies productive mucus for the first 4-5 days [P-6]; it omits mucus description ('whitish clear'), cough intensity remaining the same [P-7], stable frequency at 3-4 times/hour [P-8, P-9], spontaneous nature [P-10], and no fevers [P-12]. These are significant factual errors on key timeline elements.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: onset two weeks ago, initial flu-like symptoms (2-3 days), other symptoms resolution (3-4 days), transition to dry cough, persistent cough, chest soreness. Missed: specific sore throat/runny nose details, exact 4-5 days productive cough with 'whitish clear' mucus, intensity 'same' throughout [P-7], frequency stable at 3-4/hr spontaneous [P-8-10], no fevers [P-12], COVID negative. Covers approximately 60% of key points, missing critical details on mucus, cough characteristics, and some resolutions.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in the transcript with accurate citations: cough persistence [P-2], flu-like initial [P-13, P-14], mucus earlier [P-5], resolution [P-14], chest pain [P-15]. The transition timing 'after 2-3 days' is a minor inference stretch (transcript specifies 4-5 days [P-6]), but plausible and not hallucinated; description of cough as 'frequent and intense' is interpretive from [P-9, P-15] but verifiable. No fabricated content.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures a timeline addressing symptom onset, initial phase, transition, resolution of other symptoms, and current cough status, perfectly matching the question's request for progression details without irrelevant content."
