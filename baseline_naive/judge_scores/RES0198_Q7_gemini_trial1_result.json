  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several major factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and the source transcript. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify which symptom appeared first (P-3 explicitly says it 'felt pretty stuffy at first'). It incorrectly claims there was no shift in predominance, whereas the patient stated it is 'now mostly running' (P-3). Finally, it characterizes symptoms as 'intermittent' based on P-1, ignoring the patient's explicit clarification in P-8 that the symptoms have been 'pretty constant for the past week.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses all components of the prompt (onset, first symptom, shift in predominance, and frequency), but fails to provide the correct details for the latter three points. It misses the specific progression from congestion to rhinorrhea and the clarification regarding the constancy of the symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates poor faithfulness. It claims information is missing when it is present (P-3 regarding first symptom). More significantly, it hallucinates a connection by attributing the quote 'a little bit' from [P-15] to the consistency of nasal discharge, whereas P-15 is actually the patient's response to a question about fatigue.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it directly attempts to answer each specific part of the user's question, though the information provided is factually incorrect."
