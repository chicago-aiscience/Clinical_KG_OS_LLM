  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer correctly identifies Lipitor (prescribed for high cholesterol, confirmed as only one [P-25-P-27]) and Tylenol (OTC for symptom relief, 'helps a little bit' [P-14]). Generated Answer accurately covers Lipitor and its condition with correct citations but completely misses Tylenol, incorrectly stating no OTC medications are mentioned despite explicit transcript reference [P-14], representing a significant factual contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: (1) Lipitor for cholesterol (covered), (2) only prescribed med (implied but not explicit), (3) Tylenol OTC for symptoms with partial effectiveness (fully missed), (4) no other meds (partly covered inversely). Covers ~30% of key points (Lipitor only), missing entire OTC section.",
    "faithfulness": "Lipitor claims verifiable [P-25-P-26]; however, 'no OTC medications' directly contradicts [P-14] Tylenol mention; hallucinates 'knowledge graph' not in transcript or prompt; references symptoms [P-15,P-17,P-19] accurately but misapplies to deny OTC use.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to question on prescribed/OTC meds, conditions, and OTC effectiveness; minor tangent with hallucinated knowledge graph but overall focused on medications."
