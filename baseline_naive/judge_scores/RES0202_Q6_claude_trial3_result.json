  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains all major factual elements from the Gold Answer with no contradictions. It accurately describes the COVID swab, 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation including from the sister, false negative possibility, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and the specific warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells). All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: diagnostic test ordered, turnaround time, isolation period with sister specification, false negative acknowledgment, alternative diagnosis if negative, and specific warning signs with examples. However, it omits two minor contextual details: (1) the doctor's note in D-45 about asthma being considered if only cough/SOB without fever were present, and (2) explicit mention that no medications were prescribed with watchful waiting approach. These are secondary details but part of the complete assessment.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, particularly in [D-44] and [D-45]. The answer accurately cites [D-44] for the assessment and management plan. No hallucinated content is present. All specific details (24-48 hours, 14 days, warning signs) match the transcript exactly. The answer appropriately attributes information to the doctor's statements.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and precisely addresses all components of the question: diagnostic test and turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negative possibility, and warning signs with examples. The response is well-organized and focused, with no off-topic content. It specifically structures the answer to match the question's multiple parts."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and highly relevant response that correctly addresses all major components of the clinical question. It demonstrates strong faithfulness to the source transcript with precise citations and no hallucinations. The completeness score is slightly reduced due to the omission of two contextual details from the Gold Answer (the asthma consideration note and explicit mention of no medications/watchful waiting), though all primary assessment and management elements are thoroughly covered. Overall, this is a high-quality clinical summary that would effectively communicate the care plan."
