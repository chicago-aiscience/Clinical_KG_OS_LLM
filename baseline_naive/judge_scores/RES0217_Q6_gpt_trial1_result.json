  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies two major plan elements from the transcript: sending the tick for lab species identification (D-6/D-18) and starting prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72h attachment (D-6) and local risk (D-13). However, it contains a major factual error by stating the doctor did not provide specific preventive advice about the garden/outdoor environment; the doctor explicitly advised that ticks live in long grass/wood-field edges and suggested using insecticide (D-18). It also overstates aspects of the physical exam (e.g., “rule out systemic symptoms”) and uses an inaccurate citation (D-5 is about deer tick description, not a physical exam plan).",
    "completeness": "Key items from the Gold Answer that are covered: (1) tick sent to lab for identification; (2) physical exam mentioned; (3) antibiotics prophylaxis.\nKey items missed: (1) blood work/serology for Lyme titres (D-18); (2) planned physician/attending consultation (“go talk to the doctor… physician who’ll be having a look at you”) (D-13, D-22); (3) preventive/environmental advice about tick habitats and possible insecticide use (D-18). Overall this is well under 80% of required plan elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded or are contradicted by the transcript: it claims no specific preventive advice was given (contradicted by D-18), introduces “as detailed in the knowledge graph” (not in transcript), and attributes parts of the physical-exam intent/citation in ways not explicitly stated (and cites D-5 incorrectly). While some content is plausible, there are multiple unfaithful elements.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely focused on the doctor’s end-of-visit clinical plan (tests, exam, antibiotics, prevention). There is a minor tangent (“knowledge graph”), but most content is on-topic. The main issue is omission rather than irrelevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer captures tick identification, a planned exam, and antibiotic prophylaxis, but it omits blood work and physician consultation and incorrectly denies the preventive garden/outdoor advice that was explicitly given, reducing accuracy, completeness, and faithfulness."
