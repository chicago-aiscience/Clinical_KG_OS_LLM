  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the sequence of the seizure, the missed medication (Keppra), the morning onset of shortness of breath, and the specific temperature reading.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer: the context of the daughter's birthday as the reason for missing medication, the presence of a dry cough, the specific duration (3 hours) of respiratory symptoms, the fact that the patient never experienced this before, and the patient's uncertainty regarding the link between the seizure and breathing issues.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript. While it references 'knowledge graph information' which was not provided in the prompt, the factual claims made are all verifiable within the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request for a clinical timeline, categorizing events by time of day as requested."
