  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer in all points it covers. It correctly identifies the test, turnaround time, isolation period, false negatives, alternative diagnosis, and specific ER warning signs.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the gold answer: 1) The mention of asthma as a differential if fever had been absent (D-45). 2) The explicit mention that no medications were prescribed and the approach was watchful waiting. However, it covers all the specific requirements explicitly asked for in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript, specifically section [D-44]. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the question precisely, addressing each component (test, time, isolation, alternative, false negatives, warning signs)."
