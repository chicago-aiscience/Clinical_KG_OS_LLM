{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the two respiratory symptoms: cough and runny nose. It accurately characterizes the cough as dry/non-productive (patient denied sputum). For nasal discharge, it does not state the actual reported appearance (“pretty clear”); instead it only notes that the clinician assessed consistency/color, which is true but does not provide the correct characterization from the visit. No direct contradictions to the Gold Answer are present, but there is an important omission regarding discharge appearance.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) cough for ~4–5 days, (2) dry, (3) explicitly non-productive, (4) stayed the same, (5) runny nose for past couple of days, (6) discharge pretty clear, (7) notes about never having this dry cough before/previous runny noses shorter, (8) pertinent negatives (sore throat, chest pain, SOB/wheeze).\nGenerated Answer includes: dry/non-productive cough; runny nose present. It misses cough duration and course, runny-nose duration, the clear appearance of discharge, prior history comparison, and pertinent negatives. Overall coverage is well under 50%.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements made are grounded in the transcript: dry cough is supported by D-5/P-5 and non-productive by D-6/P-6; runny nose is supported by P-11 and the clinician’s questions about discharge characteristics by D-12. It does not invent additional symptoms or characteristics.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked respiratory symptoms and their characteristics. However, it fails to provide the specific appearance of the nasal discharge, which is central to the question."
