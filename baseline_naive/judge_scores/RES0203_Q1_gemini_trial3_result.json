  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states that the patient's loss of taste was complete ('completely lost'). Both the gold answer and the source transcript (P-4) clarify that the taste loss was partial, as the patient could still taste 'really, really salty foods'.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer: it does not mention that the patient could still smell 'really bad' odors, could taste 'salty foods', or could not taste a 'banana'. It also lacks detail about the cough being non-productive (no sputum/blood) and the duration of symptoms (two days).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer relies solely on the patient's initial statement in P-1. While P-1 says 'lost my sense of taste', the patient later clarifies in P-4 that it is not a complete loss. By ignoring P-4, the generated answer provides a misleading representation of the patient's actual reported symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the question categories (sensory and respiratory symptoms), though the content within those categories is inaccurate or incomplete."
