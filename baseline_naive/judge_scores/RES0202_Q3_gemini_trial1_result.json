{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the symptom triad (cough, temperature, taste). However, it misidentifies the parent as the 'father' (the Gold Answer says mother, and P-35 mentions a husband). It also provides an incorrect citation for the worsening cough [P-15], which actually discusses appetite; the correct reference for the worsening cough is [P-12].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the most critical part of the doctor's reasoning regarding the 'infectious process.' The Gold Answer points out that in [D-45], the doctor specifically contrasts the presence of fever with non-infectious causes like asthma to conclude it is an infection. The generated answer only vaguely notes that the symptoms are consistent with COVID-19 without explaining this specific differential logic.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is mostly grounded in the transcript, but the citation of [P-15] for the respiratory complaint is a hallucinated link (P-15 is about appetite). The attribution of the parent as 'father' is an assumption not supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is directly relevant to the question, following the structure of the prompt and addressing each requested symptom and the doctor's conclusion."
