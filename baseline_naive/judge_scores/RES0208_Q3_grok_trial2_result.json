  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer specifies 'fevers and fatigue and muscle aches' as evidence of general infectious process, with 'difficulty breathing' grouped under additional symptoms for COVID-19 concern along with sore throat and cough. The Generated Answer incorrectly includes 'difficulty breathing' in the general infectious symptoms and omits it from the COVID-19 symptoms, creating a significant factual misattribution and contradiction in symptom categorization per D-36's structure ('and then the difficulty breathing... and then... sore throat and cough').",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (general), sore throat, cough (COVID). Missed: explicit grouping of 'difficulty breathing' with COVID symptoms as additional distinct evidence; note that loss of taste/smell not cited in assessment. Covers about 60-70% of nuanced key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms listed (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) are directly verifiable in D-36 of the transcript with accurate citation; no hallucinations or unverifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly identifies and categorizes symptoms from the doctor's assessment in D-36 to answer the two-part question without off-topic content."
