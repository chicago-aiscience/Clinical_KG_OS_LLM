  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states the cough began ~2 weeks ago and persisted, and that other “flu-like” symptoms resolved early with the cough remaining. However, it contains a key factual error about timing: it implies the cough transitioned from productive to dry after the first 2–3 days, whereas the transcript specifies mucus production lasted ~4–5 days before becoming dry. It also implies the cough is now “frequent and intense enough” to cause chest pain, which misrepresents the transcript (intensity and frequency were stable; chest soreness occurs only after coughing too much).",
    "completeness": "Included: ~2-week duration; early flu-like symptoms; other symptoms resolved by ~3–4 days; cough became dry.\nMissing major Gold Answer elements: mucus duration (4–5 days) and description (“whitish clear”); sore throat duration/resolution (2–3 days) and runny nose timing; explicit statement of no fever; cough intensity unchanged over 2 weeks; frequency unchanged and quantified (3–4 times/hour); spontaneous/no triggers; cough-related chest soreness characterization; COVID test timing/result and staying home. Overall, well under half of key points are covered.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded or are contradicted by the transcript: citing [P-13] to support “flu-like symptoms for the first two or three days” conflates sore throat duration with overall flu symptoms; stating the productive-to-dry transition occurred after 2–3 days conflicts with [P-6] (4–5 days). The phrasing suggesting current cough is notably “frequent and intense” is not supported given [P-7] and [P-8] (no worsening, no increased frequency).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested symptom timeline (onset, symptom resolution, cough evolution) and does not introduce major tangents. However, it does not fully address several requested components (mucus description/duration, intensity/frequency changes), so it is relevant but incomplete."
