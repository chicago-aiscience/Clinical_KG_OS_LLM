  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: condition ruled out was asthma; mother said grandparents had asthma; patient was worked up for asthma and does not get short of breath or wheeze even with physical activity. Generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered, but then incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain the specific ruling-out findings. This directly contradicts [P-28], which explicitly lists no shortness of breath and no wheezing even with activity, and notes he was “worked up for that.” It also incorrectly shifts justification to a “Knowledge Graph,” which is not part of the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold: (1) asthma considered/rule-out; (2) family history in grandparents; (3) prior workup for asthma; (4) no shortness of breath; (5) no wheeze; (6) absent even with physical activity; (7) mother concludes he doesn’t have asthma. Generated covers only (1) partially and mentions family history generally, but misses/denies (2)-(7).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated answer introduces and relies on a “Knowledge Graph” relationship not present in the transcript (hallucinated/external). It also asserts that the mother’s specific negatives are not present, despite them being explicitly stated in [P-28]. This is ungrounded and contradicts the transcript.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to answer the asked respiratory condition and clinical findings, but fails to provide the requested findings and instead talks about unrelated portions (dry cough/runny nose, chest X-ray/COVID swab). Still broadly on-topic (respiratory condition) but does not address the core of the question."
