  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "COPD: Correctly identifies two inhalers (daily maintenance + PRN rescue) and gives the PRN frequency (~once every two weeks), consistent with [P-26]. However, it incorrectly cites [P-1] for rescue frequency (not stated there). Hypertension: Major error—states the transcript does not provide a specific reason for not taking antihypertensives, but the patient explicitly says she and her doctor discussed it and she chose lifestyle changes first [P-23], with weight loss/walking [P-24]. This directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer, and it is central to the question.",
    "completeness": "Included: (1) two inhalers for COPD, (2) daily vs PRN use, (3) PRN frequency about once every two weeks, (4) diagnosis of hypertension, (5) not taking antihypertensives.\nMissed or incorrect vs Gold: (1) reason for no antihypertensives (lifestyle-first) [P-23]—incorrectly stated as not provided; (2) lifestyle measures (weight loss, increased walking) [P-24]; (3) reports BP is currently “OK” [P-23]; (4) no home oxygen [P-1]; (5) key supportive lifestyle factors (quit smoking, rare alcohol) [P-40, P-39]; (6) COPD baseline well-managed and worsens mainly when sick [P-28, P-27]; (7) no medication allergies [P-29, P-30].",
    "faithfulness": "Most COPD statements are grounded in the transcript, but there are two notable faithfulness issues: (1) incorrect claim that no reason is given for absence of antihypertensive therapy (the reason is stated in [P-23]); (2) inaccurate citation of [P-1] for rescue inhaler frequency. The rest is largely consistent with the transcript, with minor over-interpretation (e.g., using lung specialist referral as a current 'strategy').",
    "relevance": "Response is generally focused on COPD/HTN meds and inhaler frequency, but it fails to answer a core part of the question (why she is not on antihypertensive medication) and omits several relevant management strategies (no home oxygen, lifestyle changes)."
