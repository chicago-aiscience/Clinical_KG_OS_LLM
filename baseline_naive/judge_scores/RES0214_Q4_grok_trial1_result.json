  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the diagnostic test as a COVID swab with correct citation [D-53], matching the Gold Answer. However, for the rationale, it states prioritization is based on symptoms of fever and sore throat, citing [D-53] where the doctor mentions ruling out infectious causes for that presentation. The Gold Answer highlights the epidemiological context and household transmission (husband's similar symptoms [P-19]) as the primary reason for prioritizing COVID over influenza, with the quote 'if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing...'. The Generated omits this key factor, uses a partial quote, and frames the rationale symptom-focused, creating a discrepancy in the specific reasoning for prioritization over influenza. Core facts (test ordered, COVID first) are correct, but rationale has factual errors. Score: 3",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) COVID-19 swab test [D-53] - fully covered; 2) Rationale centered on epidemiological/household transmission (husband symptoms [P-19], quote [D-53]) - missed entirely; 3) Self-isolate instruction [D-53, D-54] - missed; 4) Influenza as secondary possibility after no flu shot [P-53, D-54] - partially covered (mentions influenza later but no flu shot detail). Covers test (25%) and partial rationale/influenza (25-30%), misses 50-60% including core epidemiological rationale. Score: 3",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript: COVID swab ordered [D-53]; prioritization for fever/sore throat presentation and infectious rule-out [D-53]; partial accurate quote [D-53]; influenza as possibility [D-54]. Symptoms mentioned align with patient history (fever [P-1,P-3], sore throat [P-1]). No fabricated facts, citations precise, fully grounded. Score: 5",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response to question with sections on test and rationale for prioritizing COVID over influenza; uses transcript evidence; no tangents or off-topic content. Perfectly focused. Score: 5"
