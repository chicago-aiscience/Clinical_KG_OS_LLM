  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three symptom domains reported: reduced smell, altered taste, and a mild dry cough. However, it contains a major factual inaccuracy relative to the Gold Answer/transcript clarification: it states the patient “completely lost” taste, whereas the patient clarified taste loss was partial (can taste very salty foods but not normal foods like banana) [P-4]. It also omits key cough qualifiers present in the transcript (dry/non-productive, no blood, no worsening, onset same time), though these are omissions more than direct contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer covered: (1) decreased smell, (2) taste disturbance, (3) mild dry cough. Key points missed: partial nature of smell loss and what could still be smelled (only very strong/bad odors) [P-4]; partial nature of taste loss and what could still be tasted (very salty foods) and what could not (banana/normal foods) [P-4]; duration (2 days) [P-1, P-2]; symptoms were consistent over time [P-5, P-8]; cough non-productive/no sputum or blood [P-7]; cough not worsening [P-8]; cough started at same time as sensory symptoms [P-6]; no triggers identified [P-21]. Overall coverage is well under what the question asks (degree/what can still perceive).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in [P-1], but the claim of “completely lost” taste is not faithful to the later, more specific patient description indicating partial loss [P-4]. No clear hallucinated symptoms are introduced, but the overstatement about complete taste loss reduces faithfulness to the transcript as a whole.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays on the asked symptom categories (sensory and respiratory) and attempts to describe degree. However, it does not provide the specific perceptual details requested (what the patient could/could not still perceive) and misstates the degree of taste loss, so it only partially addresses the question."
