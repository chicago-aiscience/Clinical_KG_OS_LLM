  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the diagnosis at age eight [P-2], matching Gold. Current exacerbation over last two weeks [D-14], dry cough [P-1], shortness of breath [P-1], wheezing [P-15], baseline infrequent bronchodilator use, and recent increase to 'a lot' [P-1, P-8 implied] all align with Gold without contradictions or errors. Minor lack of precise frequencies (e.g., once every two weeks, 5-6 times/week) but no factual inaccuracies vs Gold. All facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered from Gold: diagnosis at age 8, baseline bronchodilator infrequent/not very often, current two-week exacerbation, dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, increased bronchodilator use. Missed: current age 10, specific baseline usage 'once every two weeks', specific current usage 'five-six times per week/almost every day', baseline triggers (exercise/gym/recess, cold air), seasonal worsening (winter, spring/pollen), chest tightness, wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use, nighttime symptoms every other/two days, no precipitant/infection. Covers approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims verifiable: diagnosis [P-2], symptoms (cough/SOB [P-1], wheezing [P-15]), two weeks [D-14], usage evolution [P-1,P-8]. 'Bronchodilator as standard treatment' and 'medical history confirms diagnosis' plausible but not directly quoted. Hallucinations: 'knowledge graph provided' and [KG] citations not in transcript/input, fabricated references. Minor unverifiable details, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured temporally (initial diagnosis, current symptoms, treatment evolution from baseline to current), directly addressing the question's focus on symptom and bronchodilator usage progression over time with no irrelevant content or tangents."
