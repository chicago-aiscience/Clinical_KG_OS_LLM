  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not mention medications the patient tried, whereas [P-10] explicitly mentions 'decongestants'. Consequently, it also fails to provide the patient's assessment of that medication ('worked a little bit'), instead referencing a general comment about their symptoms from [P-1]. Only the third part regarding the doctor's recommendation of Tylenol Cold is accurate.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to identify 'decongestants' as the prior treatment, fails to mention the 'worked a little bit' assessment, and omits 'hydration' from the doctor's recommended treatments.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer claims information is missing ('The transcript does not contain any information...') when it is clearly present in [P-10]. This is a failure to ground the answer in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to address all three parts of the user's question, though it fails to provide the correct information for two of them."
