  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error. It claims the transcript does not explicitly state the absence of shortness of breath or wheezing, whereas turn [P-28] explicitly says, 'he doesn't get short of breath or wheezing or anything like that.' It also fails to mention the patient's previous negative 'work-up' for asthma mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several critical points from the Gold Answer: the prior negative asthma work-up, the explicit denial of exertional symptoms, and the comparison to the patient's prior healthy history and typical illness patterns [P-24].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the transcript because it incorrectly asserts that certain information (absence of wheezing/SOB) is missing when it is clearly present. Additionally, it references an external 'Knowledge Graph' not provided in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but fails to provide the specific evidence requested (the absence of shortness of breath and wheezing) because it wrongly concludes that this information is not in the text."
