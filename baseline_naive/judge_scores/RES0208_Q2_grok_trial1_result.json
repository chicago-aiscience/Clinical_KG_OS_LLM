{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the two current medications (Avodart and Tums), their indications (prostate enlargement and reflux), and the change to the reflux regimen (stopped previous medication after identifying helpful foods), fully consistent with the Gold Answer's facts, including appropriate paraphrasing of patient descriptions and citations.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: two medications (Avodart for enlarged prostate with patient quote, Tums for reflux); change to regimen (discontinued prior reflux med independently due to dietary management via foods). Minor details like full drug name 'dutasteride', 'benign prostatic hyperplasia' acronym, 'over-the-counter antacid', exact phrasing, doctor's response, and allergies are not included but are not core to the question's requirements; covers 100% of essential points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims directly verifiable in transcript [P-25, P-26, P-27]: Avodart for prostate, Tums for reflux, prior med stopped due to foods. Paraphrase 'specific foods that triggered' aligns with 'figured out the foods that were going to help'. Minor addition of 'calcium carbonate' for Tums is accurate general knowledge but not in transcript; citations match. No hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly and concisely addresses the question by structuring response around current medications with conditions, and the specific change to reflux regimen with reason; no off-topic content."
