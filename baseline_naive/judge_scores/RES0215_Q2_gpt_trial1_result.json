{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the only medication used is occasional OTC Reactine/other OTC allergy medication for seasonal allergies, and that there are no prescribed medications in her management—both consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer (notably P-36). It does not introduce any directly contradictory medication history. Minor issue: it references a “knowledge graph” to support the prescription status of Reactine, which is not part of the transcript and is unnecessary (though it does not change the core factual conclusion).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) intermittent OTC antihistamine/Reactine use for seasonal allergies; (2) explicitly no prescribed medications. Key points missed: (a) for current wheeze/SOB episodes, mother gives her nothing and episodes resolve with rest (P-33–P-34); (b) reaffirmation that she takes no medications/no regular meds aside from occasional Reactine (P-46–P-47); (c) prior viral infections did not require antibiotics (P-16). Overall, it captures the main medication history but omits several supporting/related management details included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (Reactine/OTC use; seasonal allergy context; no prescribed meds). However, the statement about support from a “knowledge graph” is not grounded in the transcript and constitutes an extraneous, unverifiable element.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on medications/treatments used for current respiratory episodes and other conditions, and explicitly addresses whether any prescribed medication is part of management. No meaningful tangents."
