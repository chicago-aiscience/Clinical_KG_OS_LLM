  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key elements of the doctor's plan from [D-43], including physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab, labs, clinical impression of COPD exacerbation possibly due to infection, consultation with attending, and decision criteria based on labs and vital signs. It aligns fully with the Gold Answer's facts, with no contradictions; minor omission of temperature reference from earlier dialogue ([D-11]) and patient agreement ([P-43]) does not introduce errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam (vitals/chest), COVID swab, labs (mentioned in criteria), clinical impression, attending consultation, disposition criteria (labs/vitals). Missed: explicit link to temperature check from [D-11]/[P-10], patient agreement [P-43]. Covers approximately 90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-43] (physical exam, COVID swab, labs, vitals, attending consult, COPD diagnosis); citations are accurate; no hallucinated content or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured to address the question, categorizing examinations/tests, consultations, decision criteria, and clinical assessment directly from the end of the consultation, with no off-topic content."
