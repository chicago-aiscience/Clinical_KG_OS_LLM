  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the bronchodilator as the medication used. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the administration method, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions it is a 'puffer' (D-7, P-7). Furthermore, it incorrectly claims the transcript does not contain a question about daily controller medication, missing the doctor's specific inquiry in D-5: 'do you have one that you take every day no matter what?'",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two-thirds of the required information: the administration method (puffer) and the description of the daily controller medication asked about by the clinician.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer makes false claims about the absence of information in the transcript. It states the administration method and the daily controller question are missing, which constitutes a failure to ground the answer in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address all parts of the question but fails to provide the correct information for two of them, instead offering incorrect negative assertions."
