  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error. It states that the transcript 'does not explicitly state that the patient is absent of shortness of breath or wheezing,' whereas the transcript at [P-28] explicitly says: 'he doesn't get short of breath or wheezing or anything like that with even with physical activity.' This directly contradicts the source material and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover key points mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the patient being 'worked up' for asthma previously and the mention of symptoms during physical activity. It focuses on the doctor's eventual clinical plan (X-ray/COVID swab) rather than the evidence used to differentiate the condition as requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer fails the faithfulness check by claiming that information provided in the transcript is absent. This is a negative hallucination that misrepresents the content of turn [P-28].",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the question, it fails to provide the specific evidence requested (the absence of SOB/wheezing) by incorrectly asserting that such evidence is not in the text. This makes the response largely unhelpful for the specific query."
