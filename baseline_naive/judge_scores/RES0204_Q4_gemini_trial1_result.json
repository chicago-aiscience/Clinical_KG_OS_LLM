  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as asthma. However, it makes a major factual error by stating that the transcript does not contain the mother's specific clinical findings or details regarding symptoms during physical activity. These details are clearly present in turn [P-28], where the speaker (the mother) mentions the absence of shortness of breath and wheezing even during activity.",
    "completeness": "The answer only fulfills the first part of the multi-part question (identifying asthma). It fails to provide the specific symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing) and the context of physical activity, which was a core part of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails to remain faithful to the provided source text by incorrectly claiming information is missing. This is a negative hallucination, as turn [P-28] contains the exact information the response claims is absent.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant as it identifies the correct medical condition but explicitly refuses to answer the second half of the question due to its failure to locate the information in the text."
