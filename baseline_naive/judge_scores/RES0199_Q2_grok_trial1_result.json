  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the home medication for headache relief, matching Gold [P-3/P-4]; doctor's supportive measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep) and medications (Tylenol for fever, anseads/NSAIDs for aches) align with Gold [D-52]. Minor discrepancies: uses 'anseads (analgesics)' reflecting transcript misspelling but correctly interpreting as NSAIDs; references non-existent 'knowledge graph'; omits COVID test/isolation and patient's hydration effort, but core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers: patient's Tylenol for headache; doctor's hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, anseads/NSAIDs for aches. Misses: patient's self-hydration [P-30]; COVID swab and 14-day isolation [D-52]; explicit 'no prescription meds'. Covers ~85% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims verifiable in transcript: Tylenol/headache [P-3/P-4], recs [D-52]. 'Knowledge graph' not in transcript (hallucination, minor); 'anseads' directly from transcript, plausibly interpreted; citations accurate. Mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structured around question: patient's med/symptom, then doctor's supportive measures/meds; no tangents or off-topic content."
