  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and transcript. It incorrectly states the initial onset was one month ago, whereas the transcript (P-2, P-13) and Gold Answer specify three months. It also incorrectly claims there was no mention of subjective fevers, whereas the patient explicitly mentioned feeling 'hot at night' in P-4. It also fails to mention the three-day duration for the greenish sputum.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the three-month initial onset, the transition from dry to productive cough, the specific three-day timeframe for the purulent sputum, and the development of subjective fevers within the last few days.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript in two major ways. First, it ignores the patient's statement in P-2 that they have had the cough for 'three months.' Second, it claims no mention of subjective fever was found, which is a hallucinated absence given the clear statement in P-4 ('feeling like hot at night').",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the specific timeline requested (onset, sleep, sputum, fevers), but because it provides incorrect information or misses the data present in the text, its utility is limited."
