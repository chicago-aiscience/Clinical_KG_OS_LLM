  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The four reported symptoms (fever x3 days, stuffy nose preceding fever, persistent sore throat, muscle aches) match the Gold Answer and transcript. The list of denied symptoms (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing) is also consistent with the transcript. However, the Generated Answer contains an incorrect rationale: it claims that because these symptoms were not mentioned in [P-1], the patient “effectively denied them.” In fact, she explicitly denied them later when asked (e.g., [P-5], [P-7], [P-8], [P-10], [P-24–P-26]). It also incorrectly cites [P-1] as the source for the denials in the summary.",
    "completeness": "Covers all 4 symptoms asked for (stuffy nose, sore throat, fever, muscle aches). Includes all 5 clinically significant negatives requested (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing). Missing the Gold Answer’s important nuance that she could still swallow food/liquids without coughing/aspiration ([P-25–P-26]), and does not mention vomiting (paired with nausea in the transcript), though vomiting was not explicitly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not properly grounded: the answer asserts the patient denied symptoms because she didn’t report them in [P-1], which is not supported. Citations are inaccurate: the denials are attributed to [P-1] rather than the actual turns where she denied them. While the final lists are largely consistent with the transcript, the supporting statements/citations introduce multiple unfaithful elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing the four reported symptoms and identifying which of the specified symptoms she denied. Minimal extraneous content."
