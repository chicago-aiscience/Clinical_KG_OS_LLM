  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the primary diagnosis and the core symptoms (chest tightness, dyspnea on exertion) and medical history (asthma). However, it suggests the doctor linked the findings to the 'current use of salbutamol,' whereas the Gold Answer and the transcript emphasize that the doctor linked it to the patient 'limiting' or skipping their medications (D-34, P-17, P-19). This is a minor discrepancy in the clinical logic.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers several key points (history, exertional symptoms, cardiac exclusion) but misses critical elements mentioned in the Gold Answer: the patient's lack of medication adherence (skipping night doses/no rescue inhaler), the absence of new environmental triggers, and the patient's own intuition that it might be related to their asthma despite feeling 'different.'",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using accurate citations for the symptoms (P-1, P-7), history (P-16), and the doctor's plan (D-35, D-36). It does not hallucinate information outside the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question: the combination of symptoms/history and the logical linking used by the doctor."
