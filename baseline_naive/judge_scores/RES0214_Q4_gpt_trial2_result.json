  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnostic test as a COVID-19 swab (matches Gold: “we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what” [D-53]). However, its stated rationale for prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza is partially incorrect/misattributed. In the transcript, the doctor’s explicit reason for COVID being the *first* rule-out is the household transmission pattern (“if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out” [D-53]) plus the associated concern for contagiousness/self-isolation. The Generated Answer instead centers the prioritization mainly on the symptom pattern (fever and sore throat), which the doctor cites as a reason to rule out “anything infectious,” but not specifically as the reason to prioritize COVID over flu.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) COVID swab ordered; (2) COVID prioritized before influenza; (3) influenza mentioned later as a possibility. Key points missed or underdeveloped: (1) the doctor’s explicit prioritization rationale tied to the husband having similar symptoms/household spread [P-19, D-53]; (2) the self-isolation instruction and its connection to potential transmissibility/containment [D-53, D-54]; (3) influenza discussed after asking about lack of flu shot [P-53, D-54]. Overall, it captures some but not most of the Gold rationale details.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the doctor ordered a COVID swab is directly supported. The statement that the doctor prioritized COVID because of fever and sore throat is only weakly supported: the doctor links fever/sore throat to ruling out infectious causes generally, but links COVID-first specifically to the husband having similar symptoms. Thus, there is some drift from what was explicitly stated, but no major fabricated events or tests.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the two things asked: (1) what test was ordered; (2) why COVID was prioritized over influenza. No substantial irrelevant content."
