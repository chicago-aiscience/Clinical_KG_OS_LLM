  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma recurrence as the top differential diagnosis, accurately describes the physical examination component (listening to lungs), correctly identifies rescue puffers as the first-step treatment, and accurately captures the contingency plan of 'coming back to the table' if rescue inhalers don't help. All facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components: overall assessment (asthma recurrence), physical examination plan (lung auscultation), initial treatment (rescue puffers), and contingency approach (reassess if no improvement). However, it omits some details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the doctor's mention of consulting with 'the doc' [D-35, D-37], (2) the specific framing of this as a 'therapeutic trial', (3) the 'one thing at a time' stepwise approach language [D-36], and (4) the context that patient currently lacks rescue puffers [P-17, P-18]. These are minor but meaningful details that reduce completeness slightly.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The assessment is from D-35, physical exam plans from D-35, treatment recommendation from D-35, and contingency from D-35. There is one minor issue: the reference to '[KG]' (knowledge graph) appears to be an artifact from the system generating the answer and is not grounded in the provided transcript. This represents a minor unexplained element, though the core clinical content remains faithful.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: overall assessment (asthma recurrence diagnosis), physical examination components (lung auscultation), treatment intervention (rescue puffers), and contingency approach (reassess if ineffective). All content is relevant and focused on answering the specific question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core clinical assessment and plan with correct factual content. It covers all major required components: asthma as top differential, lung examination, rescue inhaler trial, and reassessment contingency. Minor deductions for completeness due to omitting contextual details like physician consultation and the patient's current lack of rescue inhalers. Minor deduction for faithfulness due to unexplained '[KG]' reference not grounded in transcript. Overall a strong, clinically accurate response that directly addresses the question."
