  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the primary respiratory and systemic symptoms. However, it incorrectly lists 'High Blood Pressure' as a symptom reported 'during her acute 3-day worsening'. The transcript clarifies that High Blood Pressure is a pre-existing chronic condition [P-22], not an acute symptom of the current exacerbation. It also misses the mild headache mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two specific symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: reduced exercise tolerance (difficulty walking the dog/around the block) [P-4] and a mild headache [P-14]. It also omits the 'pertinent negatives' which were included in the Gold Answer's comprehensive summary of symptoms reported/denied during the encounter.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms listed exist within the transcript. However, categorizing the chronic 'High Blood Pressure' as an acute systemic symptom of the 3-day worsening is a contextual inaccuracy (minor hallucination of the relationship between facts).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the question with a clear structure that separates respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, and the most bothersome symptom."
