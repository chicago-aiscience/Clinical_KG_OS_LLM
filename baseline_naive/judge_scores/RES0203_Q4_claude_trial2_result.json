  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims there are 'no documented negative findings' when the transcript explicitly shows the doctor asked about and the patient denied multiple symptoms: fever [D-10, P-10], difficulty breathing [D-11, P-11], headaches [D-12, P-12], sore throat [D-13, P-13], chills/night sweats [D-14, P-14], muscle aches/weakness [D-15, P-15], and chest pain [D-22, P-22]. These are clearly documented in the transcript but the Generated Answer states they are not.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question. It does not list the negative findings from the review of systems as requested, nor does it explain how these absences informed the clinical picture. It only discusses positive findings (loss of taste/smell, dry cough) which was not what the question asked for. The Gold Answer comprehensively lists all negative findings with citations, while the Generated Answer provides none of this information.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination by claiming the transcript does not include patient answers about absence of symptoms. This directly contradicts what is clearly present in the transcript from D-10 through D-15 and D-22, where multiple negative findings are documented. The claim that 'there are no documented negative findings' is fabricated and contradicts the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely off-topic. The question specifically asks for negative findings and how they informed the clinical picture, but the Generated Answer instead focuses on positive findings and claims (incorrectly) that negative findings are not documented. It does not address the core question about what symptoms were systematically screened for and confirmed absent."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally flawed across all dimensions. It incorrectly claims that negative findings are not documented in the transcript when they are clearly present throughout (fever, dyspnea, sore throat, headaches, chills, muscle aches, chest pain). This represents both a factual error and a hallucination. The answer fails to address the question by not listing these negative findings or explaining their clinical significance. Instead, it focuses on positive findings, which was not what was asked. The response demonstrates a complete misreading of the source transcript and fails to provide the requested systematic review of negative findings."
