  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies key symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) as consistent with asthma and notes the patient's history and increased bronchodilator use, matching Gold's core facts; however, it omits chest tightness (explicitly in question and Gold P-20), uses vague description of bronchodilator increase instead of exact 'once every two weeks to five or six times per week' (P-8), and fails to address screening for new conditions (e.g., no infections, fevers), which Gold emphasizes to differentiate from new respiratory issue.",
    "completeness": "Covered: dry cough (P-1,P-14), shortness of breath (P-1), wheezing (P-15), asthma diagnosis (P-2), bronchodilator helps and increased use (P-1,P-8 vaguely), family history (P-32).\nMissed: chest tightness (P-20), exact bronchodilator frequency escalation (P-8), wheezing more frequent than use (P-17), triggers like exercise/cold (P-9,P-11), comprehensive negative infection screen (P-21-P-28), reversible obstruction, need for med adjustment (D-43). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: symptoms and citations (P-1, P-15, D-14, P-2, P-32) verifiable in transcript; bronchodilator helps (P-1) accurate. Minor issues: vague frequency without citing P-8 precisely; 'knowledge graph supports' not in transcript (hallucination/external reference); no fabrication of facts but one unverifiable detail.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by linking specified symptoms (partial) and bronchodilator increase to worsening asthma vs new condition; focused explanation with evidence, no major off-topic content despite minor extras like family history."
