  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the bronchodilator as the patient's asthma medication, matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that the administration method is not specified in the transcript, contradicting the Gold Answer's reference to it being a 'puffer' (D-7, P-7). It also erroneously claims there is no specific question about a daily controller medication, ignoring D-5 ('do you have one that you take every day no matter what?') and P-5 (patient denies having it), which directly contradicts the Gold Answer. These are significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) sole medication is bronchodilator (rescue inhaler), as-needed (covered partially); (2) administered via 'puffer' (missed); (3) no other medications (missed); (4) doctor asked about 'every day no matter what' daily controller, patient does not have (missed entirely, claimed absent). Covers only ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Bronchodilator claim verifiable in P-1, P-4, etc. However, claim that administration method 'not specified' is false (D-7/P-7: 'puffer'); claim that transcript 'does not contain a specific question' about daily controller is hallucinated (directly in D-5); misinterprets D-29 (about health problems, not meds). Multiple hallucinated absences of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to directly address each part of the question (medication used, administration, daily controller), with no off-topic content, though answers are incorrect."
