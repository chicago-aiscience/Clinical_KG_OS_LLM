  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states asthma was considered/rule-out and that the mother cited prior work-up plus absence of shortness of breath and wheeze, including with physical activity. The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered, but it incorrectly claims the transcript does not contain the mother’s cited rule-out findings. In fact, [P-28] explicitly contains these findings (no SOB, no wheeze, even with activity, worked up, ‘he doesn’t have that’). It also relies on a purported “Knowledge Graph,” which is not part of the provided transcript and is therefore not a valid basis here.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) asthma was considered. Key points missed: (1) grandparents had asthma/family history detail as stated by mother; (2) patient had been “worked up for that”; (3) absence of shortness of breath; (4) absence of wheezing; (5) absence of these symptoms even with physical activity; (6) mother’s conclusion ‘he doesn’t have that’; (7) contextual distinction that patient is otherwise healthy/first dry cough episode. Overall, it covers only a small fraction of required details.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer introduces and bases reasoning on a “Knowledge Graph” that is not in the Source Transcript (hallucinated/unsupported). It also states that the mother’s specific activity-related negative symptoms are not present in the source text, which directly contradicts [P-28]. Although it accurately quotes that the doctor asked about family history and mentions cough/runny nose/X-ray/COVID swab lines, the key claim about missing data is unfaithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to address the question (identify the ruled-out respiratory condition and supporting negatives) but fails to provide the requested clinical findings and incorrectly asserts they are absent. Some included details (dry cough, runny nose, X-ray/COVID swab plan) are not what the question asks for, reducing focus."
