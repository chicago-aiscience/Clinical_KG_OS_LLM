  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient’s dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and increased bronchodilator reliance suggest worsening asthma in a child with known asthma. However, it omits one of the key symptoms explicitly asked about (chest tightness) and does not state the key quantitative change in bronchodilator use (from ~once every two weeks to 5–6 times/week). It also adds an unsupported statement about a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer rationale.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points covered: (1) dry cough, (2) shortness of breath, (3) wheezing, (4) known asthma history since age 8, (5) bronchodilator helps, (6) mentions increased bronchodilator use in general terms, (7) family history (present in transcript though not central in Gold).\nKey points missed: (1) chest tightness, (2) the dramatic, specific increase in reliever use (once every two weeks → 5–6/week), (3) wheezing occurring even more frequently than bronchodilator use, (4) trigger pattern (exercise/cold air/pollen), (5) clinician’s negative infectious/COVID screen (no fever, sick contacts, loss of taste/smell, travel, productive cough, etc.), (6) the rationale that reversible obstruction/response to bronchodilator supports asthma over a new condition (only implied). Overall this is ~50–70% of Gold’s core support.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (dry cough, SOB, wheeze, bronchodilator helps, asthma diagnosis, increased use broadly, family history). The main ungrounded element is the reference to a “knowledge graph,” which is not in the transcript and introduces extraneous justification. Also, the description of increased bronchodilator use is vague and does not reflect the transcript’s specific frequency change.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (asthma worsening vs new respiratory condition) but does not directly answer the question as asked because it fails to include chest tightness and the specific bronchodilator frequency change (once every two weeks → five or six times/week), which are central to the prompt."
