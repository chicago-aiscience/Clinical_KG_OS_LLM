  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it states that the transcript does not explicitly mention if symptoms were getting better, worse, or staying the same. However, in [P-2], the patient explicitly states, 'I think it's staying the same.' This directly contradicts the transcript and the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details present in the gold answer and requested by the prompt: 1) It fails to mention the symptoms remained 'the same'. 2) It misses specific exacerbating factors like 'getting up out of a chair' and 'taking a big breath in'. 3) Regarding the walking routine, it provides a vague statement ('presents a barrier') instead of the specific detail that the patient went from two walks a day to one.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is mostly faithful to the transcript for the parts it includes, but the claim that the transcript lacks information about the evolution of symptoms is a hallucination of absence (a failure to retrieve clear information present in the source).",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address all parts of the question, although it fails to provide the correct information for several of those parts."
