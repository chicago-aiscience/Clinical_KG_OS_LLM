  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer and the transcript. The transcript clearly documents multiple negative ROS findings (e.g., no fever [P-10], no dyspnea [P-11], no headache [P-12], no sore throat [P-13], no chills/night sweats [P-14], no myalgias/weakness [P-15], no chest pain [P-22], dry cough with no sputum/blood [P-7], no triggers [P-21]). The Generated Answer incorrectly states there are “no documented negative findings” and that the transcript does not include patient answers about these symptoms, which directly contradicts the source transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer lists numerous pertinent negatives (fever, dyspnea, headache, sore throat, chills/night sweats, myalgias/weakness, chest pain, sputum/hemoptysis, cough triggers) plus additional denials (no chronic conditions, meds, surgeries/hospitalizations, allergies, family history). The Generated Answer includes essentially none of these negatives and instead focuses on positives; it therefore misses nearly all key points required by the question and the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is not grounded in the transcript: it asserts that negative findings are not documented, even though they are explicitly present in the dialogue. It also introduces an external element (“knowledge graph”) that is not in the transcript, which is an additional hallucinated/unsupported reference. Overall, multiple claims conflict with verifiable transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question about negative ROS findings and their clinical significance, but it largely fails by claiming there were no negatives and pivoting to positive findings. While on-topic in intent, it does not provide the requested list or explanation based on the documented ROS negatives."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript by denying clearly documented negative ROS findings, omits nearly all required negatives from the Gold Answer, and adds unsupported content, making it largely incorrect and unfaithful despite partial topical relevance."
