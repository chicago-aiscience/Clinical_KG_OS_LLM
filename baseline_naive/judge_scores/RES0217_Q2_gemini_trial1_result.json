  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer regarding the patient's use of an unnamed statin, the history of antibiotics for a previous bullseye rash, and the doctor's proposal of prophylactic antibiotics due to the potential 72-hour attachment window. No factual errors were found.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary medications (current statin and proposed/past antibiotics) but misses several secondary points from the Gold Answer: it does not mention that the statin is for cholesterol management, the patient's lack of drug allergies, the doctor's plan to consult a supervising physician, or the recommendation to use insecticide in the garden.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript. It correctly cites the relevant turns (P-15, D-6, P-3) and does not include any information not present in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the specific components of the question: current statin therapy and proposed prophylactic treatments for the tick bite."
