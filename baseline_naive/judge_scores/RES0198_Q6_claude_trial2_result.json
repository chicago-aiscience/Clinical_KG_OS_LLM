  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all the key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the diagnosis as 'most likely a viral infection like the common cold', includes both supportive care recommendations (staying hydrated and using Tylenol Cold), mentions the COVID swab test with 48-hour results, and covers all isolation instructions. The Generated Answer uses slightly different wording but maintains factual consistency throughout.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the viral infection/common cold diagnosis, (2) both supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold), (3) the diagnostic swab test with timing details, and (4) all public health guidance including isolation instructions and awaiting further instructions. It also adds context about symptom overlap with COVID-19, which enriches the answer. The answer is well-structured with clear categories matching all elements requested in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly traceable to statement D-39 in the transcript. The diagnosis, supportive care measures, test ordering, timing of results, and isolation instructions are all explicitly stated by the doctor in D-39. The answer appropriately uses [D-39] citations throughout and includes [KG] notations. No information appears to be fabricated or extrapolated beyond what the doctor communicated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance. The bulleted structure with clear categories (Diagnosis, Supportive Care Recommendations, Diagnostic Test, Public Health Guidance) perfectly maps to the question's requirements. All content is focused on the management plan as communicated at the end of the visit."
