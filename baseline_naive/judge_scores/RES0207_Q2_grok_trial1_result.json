  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication for epilepsy, matching the Gold Answer [P-23, P-8]. It accurately notes the patient forgot the medication [P-9], consistent with Gold. However, it fails to specify the circumstance (daughter's birthday celebration and altered dinner routine [P-24]) and introduces an unverified claim about a 'knowledge graph,' which is not in the Gold Answer or transcript, creating a minor discrepancy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: Keppra for epilepsy [P-23, P-8]; forgot med [P-9]; specific circumstance: daughter's birthday, usual dinner routine disrupted by early celebration [P-24]; doctor's acknowledgment of isolated lapse [D-24, D-25]; seizure link [P-9]. Generated covers Keppra/epilepsy and basic 'forgot' [P-9], but misses birthday details, routine explanation, doctor's comments, and seizure context. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Keppra [P-23] and forgetting [P-9] are verifiable in transcript. Epilepsy as chronic condition grounded [P-8, P-22]. However, 'supported by the knowledge graph, which identifies Keppra as a treatment for epilepsy' is a hallucination—no knowledge graph or external validation in transcript. Minor hallucination, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medication (Keppra for epilepsy) and missed dose (forgotten), structured response matches question. Lacks specificity on circumstance but no off-topic content; minor shortfall in depth."
