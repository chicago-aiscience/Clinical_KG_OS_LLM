  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it attributes the patient's response 'Like, I've heard of it' [P-32] to asthma, whereas the transcript shows this was a response to the doctor's question about eczema [D-32]. Additionally, it classifies 'headache' as a proactive screen by the doctor, but the patient actually volunteered this symptom in [P-1] before the doctor followed up.",
    "completeness": "The answer is very incomplete. It fails to address 'eczema' and 'allergic reactions requiring an EpiPen', both of which were explicitly listed in the prompt's examples. It also misses several categories found in the gold answer, including productive cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, joint pain, and skin changes.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer frequently references a 'knowledge graph' and specific mapping categories (e.g., [DIAGNOSIS], [SYMPTOM], [INDICATES]) that do not exist in the provided source transcript. This suggests the model is hallucinating external data structures or following instructions from a different context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it addresses the general topic of screenings, it ignores the specific conditions requested in the parenthetical of the prompt (eczema, EpiPen) and includes self-reported symptoms as screenings."

  "summary": "The answer is poor because it misses specific conditions requested in the prompt, misattributes patient statements to the wrong medical conditions, and hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' source."
