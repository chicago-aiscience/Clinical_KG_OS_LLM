  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the symptoms (stuffy/runny nose) and discharge quality (clear) mentioned in the transcript. However, it incorrectly asserts that a one-week duration distinguishes the condition from 'sudden acute allergic reactions'; in the transcript/gold answer, the evidence against allergy is the lack of exposure history and prior history of allergies. It also relies on the 'implication' of the doctor's diagnosis rather than citing the actual negative evidence (absent features) provided by the patient.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several critical components required by the prompt and found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits: (1) 'Absent features' (denial of cough, fever, sore throat, headache) which are key to ruling out bacterial/COVID/other infections; (2) 'Exposure history' (the nephew in daycare); and (3) specific evidence against an allergic cause (lack of exposure to dust/animals and no history of allergies). It covers less than 50% of the reasoning found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, but it contains a hallucination regarding the source, mentioning a 'knowledge graph' that was not provided in the context. The logic regarding the duration of allergic reactions vs. viral infections is also an external inference not found in the text.",
    "relevance": "The response is only partially relevant. While it addresses why the doctor suspected a viral infection, it fails to follow the prompt's specific instructions to use 'absent features' and 'exposure history' as evidence. It also provides a very weak explanation for why the condition was not allergic or bacterial, which was a primary part of the question's 'rather than' clause. It focuses more on the doctor's treatment plan than the diagnostic evidence requested in the prompt's categories (absent features/exposure).\",\n    \"scores\": {\n      \"correctness\": 3,\n      \"completeness\": 2,\n      \"faithfulness\": 4,\n      \"relevance\": 2\n    },\n    \"average_score\": 2.75,\n    \"summary\": \"The generated answer identifies some symptoms but fails to include the negative findings (absent features) and exposure history explicitly requested in the prompt to differentiate the diagnosis from allergic or bacterial causes."
