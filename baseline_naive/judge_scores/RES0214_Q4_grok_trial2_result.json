  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID swab as the test ordered, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-53]. For the rationale, it attributes prioritization to symptoms (fever and sore throat) and ruling out infectious causes [D-53], which is factually present in the transcript. However, the Gold Answer emphasizes the epidemiological context of household transmission (husband's symptoms [P-19]) as the key reason for prioritizing COVID over influenza, with the quote 'if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing.' The Generated omits this specific linkage, creating a minor discrepancy in emphasis, but core facts (test and prioritization) align without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) COVID swab test [D-53]; 2) Rationale centered on epidemiological/household transmission ([P-19], [D-53]); 3) Self-isolation instruction [D-53, D-54]; 4) Influenza as secondary possibility post-no flu shot [P-53, D-54]. Generated covers: test fully; partial prioritization quote [D-53]; flu mention [D-54]; symptoms as rationale (related but not Gold's focus). Misses: explicit household transmission detail, self-isolation, flu shot specificity. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are verifiable in transcript: COVID swab [D-53]; symptoms (fever [P-1, D-3], sore throat [P-1]); 'rule out infectious' and prioritization quote [D-53]; influenza possibility [D-54]. No hallucinations or inaccurate citations; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around the question with sections for test and rationale, quotes transcript accurately, and stays focused without off-topic content."
