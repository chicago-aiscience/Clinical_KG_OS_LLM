  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer fails to provide the symptoms and exposure risks that were denied by the patient, which was the central requirement of the question. Instead, it lists symptoms the patient admitted to (fatigue, sleep disturbance) and her medical history (eczema). Furthermore, it incorrectly classifies eczema as an 'exposure risk,' which is clinically inaccurate.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses nearly all the key points from the gold answer. It fails to mention the denied constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis) and the denied exposure risks (sick contacts, travel history, and IV drug use).",
    "faithfulness": "While the symptoms mentioned (fatigue, sleep disturbance, eczema) are found in the transcript, they are used to answer the question incorrectly. The claim that eczema is an exposure risk is not supported by the transcript or general clinical logic in this context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely irrelevant to the specific prompt because it focuses on reported symptoms rather than the 'denied' symptoms and 'exposure risks' requested. It only successfully addresses the 'conditions to exclude' portion of the question (TB and chronic infections)."
