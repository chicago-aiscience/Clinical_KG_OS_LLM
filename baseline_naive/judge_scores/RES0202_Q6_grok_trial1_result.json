  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key elements of the management plan from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation (including sister), false negative possibility, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and exact warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). However, it omits the explicit assessment phrasing ('viral infectious process aligned with COVID-19' and 'sounds like an infection') and the conditional asthma differential if no fever [D-45], representing minor discrepancies while keeping core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab and TAT (100%), isolation period including sister (100%), false negatives (100%), alternative diagnosis if negative (100%), warning signs with examples (100%). Missed: full assessment description ('symptom constellation consistent with viral infectious process aligned with COVID-19'; 'sounds like an infection'), asthma differential note [D-45], and explicit mention of no medications/watchful waiting. Covers approximately 80-90% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-44] of the transcript (COVID swab/24-48hrs, 14-day isolation incl. sister, false negatives, another viral illness, specific warning signs). Citation [D-44] is accurate; no hallucinations, fabrications, or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured precisely around the question's requested elements (assessment/plan including test/TAT, isolation, alt dx/false neg, warning signs), with bullet points directly addressing each without tangents or off-topic content."
