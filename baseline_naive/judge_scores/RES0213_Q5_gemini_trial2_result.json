  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains two significant factual errors compared to the transcript: 1) It claims the patient sets aside time for 'school books' instead of relaxing books, whereas the transcript [P-28] states the exact opposite. 2) It claims the patient hasn't seen a doctor in eight years due to family worry, but the transcript [P-21] specifies she hasn't seen a doctor specifically *for anxiety* in that timeframe, and no reason related to family worry is given.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including the paternal grandfather's history [P-30], the detail about living alone [P-27], the specific age she started smoking (18), and the physical symptom of breathing faster during episodes [P-19].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer includes hallucinations regarding the reason for the eight-year gap in doctor visits. It also references an external 'knowledge graph' (KG) which is not part of the provided source transcript. The reversal of the reading habit detail is also unfaithful to the source text.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant as it follows the requested structure, addressing family history, smoking, and stressors individually before synthesizing their interactions."
