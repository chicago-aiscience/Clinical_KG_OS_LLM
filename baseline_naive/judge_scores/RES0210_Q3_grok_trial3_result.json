  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is mostly factually accurate compared to the Gold Answer: it correctly identifies productive cough with red spots in sputum [P-4], systemic fever [P-5 vs Gold's P-8] and chills [P-9], exertional dyspnea [P-10], and pleuritic right-sided chest pain worsening with deep breaths/coughing [P-17, P-19]. Minor discrepancies include omitting the 'yellow custard' purulent detail [P-6], not specifying fever onset on Monday or chills timing precisely, incomplete chest pain description (misses constant/dull even when lying [P-20,21]), and no mention of smoking risk factor; calls blood spots 'hemoptysis' (accurate inference but not verbatim); core facts align without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: productive cough with red spots [P-4,6 partial], blood-tinged sputum [P-4,6 partial], fever [P-8 partial], chills [P-9], exertional dyspnea/winded on stairs [P-10,11 partial]. Partially covers pleuritic pain worsening with breath/cough [P-18,19] and right-sided [P-17]. Missed/explicitly incomplete: 'yellow custard' sputum purulence [P-6], full pain details (constant, dull, present lying down [P-20-21]), smoking history as predisposing [P-37,38]. Covers ~80% of key diagnostic elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: cough [P-1], red spots gunk [P-4], fever [P-5], chills [P-9], winded on exertion [P-10], right pain worse with deep breath/cough [P-17-19]. 'Purulent' inferred from context (yellow implied), no fabrications; reasoning on pleuritis grounded in symptoms without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by listing specific transcript findings (cough/sputum, systemic signs, dyspnea) supporting LRTI/pneumonia and explaining how pleuritic pain (worsening with inspiration/cough) localizes to pleural involvement in pneumonia; structured, focused, no off-topic content."
