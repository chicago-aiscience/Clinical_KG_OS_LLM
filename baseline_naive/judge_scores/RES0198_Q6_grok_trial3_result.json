{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-39]. Diagnosis matches 'viral infection like the common cold' with accurate mention of COVID overlap; supportive care lists hydration and Tylenol Cold precisely; diagnostic test correctly identifies COVID swab with 48-hour results; public health guidance matches isolation and follow-up instructions. No contradictions or errors, though some phrasings are interpretive (e.g., 'rule in or out') but grounded.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnosis (viral/common cold + COVID context), supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (swab, 48 hours), public health (isolation at home, no contact, await public health instructions). Missed: explicit mention of symptom duration ('a few weeks to fully resolve') and statement that 'not much beyond supportive care' is available, as well as swab 'performed today'. Covers ~85% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims are directly verifiable in [D-39] (diagnosis, hydration, Tylenol, swab for COVID, 48 hours, isolation, public health follow-up). Minor unverifiable details include repeated '[KG]' citations (not present in transcript) and interpretive phrasing like 'rule in or out COVID-19' (plausible but not verbatim). No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured around the question's required elements (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance), with no off-topic content or tangents."
