  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient's symptom progression (stuffy nose, followed by fever, sore throat, and muscle aches). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the husband's timeline. It states that the specific duration or exact timeline of the husband's symptoms is not provided, whereas the transcript explicitly states in [P-19] that the husband has been experiencing symptoms for 'the past week'.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the patient's symptoms thoroughly but fails to provide the chronological comparison to the husband's illness, which was a specific requirement of the prompt. By claiming the information is missing, it omits the key detail that the husband's illness began approximately four days before the patient's.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly faithful regarding the patient's symptoms, but it hallucinates an absence of information. The claim that the husband's symptom duration is 'not provided' is directly contradicted by the source text at [P-19].",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant to the question as it structures the patient's symptom progression clearly. However, it fails to fulfill the second half of the prompt's requirements regarding the husband's timeline comparison."
