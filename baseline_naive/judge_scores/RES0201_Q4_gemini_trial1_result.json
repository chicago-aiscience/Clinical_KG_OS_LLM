  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly asserts that the negative findings 'exclude or distinguish' COVID-19, whereas the transcript shows the doctor still suspected COVID-19 and ordered a test. Furthermore, it treats the patient's partial loss of taste as a negative finding to distinguish COVID-19, despite taste changes being a hallmark symptom. It fails to capture the doctor's actual diagnostic logic provided in the Gold Answer regarding upper respiratory infections (URI) or chest pain.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. It only mentions 'loss of smell' and 'loss of taste' as negative findings. It misses several other key negative findings listed in the Gold Answer: cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, sick contacts, and travel history. It also fails to discuss the implications for other conditions like URI.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer references a 'Knowledge Graph' multiple times, which was not part of the provided source material (transcript). It also misinterprets the patient's reported 'reduced sense of taste' as a negative finding that contradicts the typical COVID-19 presentation, whereas the patient actually confirmed a change in taste.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to answer both parts of the question, but the response is so narrow and factually skewed that it provides little value relative to the specific details requested."
