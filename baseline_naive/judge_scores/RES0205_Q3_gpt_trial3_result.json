  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis and correctly states that testing was negative, consistent with the patient’s statement “I have had the covid test and I don't have it” [P-35]. The described prompting factors (persistent 2-week cough; hospital worker) are accurate and supported by the transcript [P-2, P-34/P-17]. No contradictory or incorrect claims relative to the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) COVID-19 investigated; (2) hospital employment as a risk/driver for investigation; (3) persistent cough as a concern; (4) negative test result.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (1) initial flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose) as part of the prompting evidence [P-13, P-14]; (2) coworkers being scared when patient coughs as a social/occupational reason to rule out COVID [P-35]; (3) patient wearing PPE/being careful [P-17]; (4) timing of the test at symptom onset ~2 weeks ago [P-36]; (5) patient stayed home after testing while awaiting improvement [P-36]. Overall, it captures less than half of the Gold Answer’s supporting evidence/details.",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript (persistent cough duration and character [P-2, P-5]; hospital worker [P-34]; COVID test negative [P-35]). It does not introduce specific unverified events or results. The generic statement about heightened suspicion due to hospital work is reasonable and consistent with transcript context.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers all parts of the question (diagnosis investigated, what prompted it, and what testing revealed) without irrelevant tangents."
