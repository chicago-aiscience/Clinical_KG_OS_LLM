  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely inconsistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. The transcript clearly includes multiple doctor turns (e.g., [D-47], [D-48]) that state both the summary assessment and plan, but the Generated Answer incorrectly claims there are no [D-X] segments and that the doctor’s plan/assessment cannot be determined. It also incorrectly summarizes symptom duration as “approximately one month,” whereas the history and the doctor’s summary indicate a cough for ~3 months, with worsening over the last ~3 days and nocturnal awakening. Therefore, it fails to provide the correct plan (review with supervising doctors), correct assessment (chronic cough with acute worsening, green sputum, no blood, no constitutional symptoms), and correct driver of next steps (supervising physician review).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed: (1) doctor’s end-of-visit summary in [D-47] (3-month cough, worse 3 days, wakes at night, green sputum, no blood), (2) explicit statement of no constitutional symptoms, (3) plan to review the story with the doctors/supervising physician, (4) next steps guided by supervising physician assessment after reviewing history, (5) no tests/treatments ordered. The Generated Answer provides none of these; instead it provides an incorrect claim of missing doctor dialogue and an incomplete/partly incorrect patient-only summary. Coverage is well under 20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or directly contradict the provided transcript: it claims the transcript contains only patient dialogue and no doctor segments, which is false (multiple [D-X] lines are present, including the key [D-47]/[D-48]). It also states the cough has been ongoing for “approximately one month,” which is not accurate given the patient reports a cough for three months and nighttime awakening for about a month. Some details (eczema history, sleep disturbance) are grounded in patient lines, but the major framing is contradicted by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for (1) the doctor’s stated plan at the end, (2) the doctor’s summary assessment, and (3) what information would guide next steps. The Generated Answer does not answer these and instead asserts it is impossible, then provides a partial patient symptom summary. This is only minimally responsive to the clinical context and does not address the requested doctor plan/assessment/decision drivers."
