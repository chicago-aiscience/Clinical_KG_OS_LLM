  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. While it correctly identifies the timeline calculation in D-6, it completely misses the critical geographic discussion about Strathroy that occurs in P-12 and D-13. The claim that 'The provided transcript segments...do not contain any information regarding Strathroy or a discussion about the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map' directly contradicts the actual transcript where the patient states 'We were uh in Strathroy along the creek' [P-12] and the doctor explicitly references checking 'a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario' and concludes 'Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point' [D-13].",
    "completeness": "The answer only addresses half of the question. It adequately covers the tick attachment duration calculation (Friday/Saturday leading to >72 hours), but completely omits the second part about how the doctor used Strathroy's position on the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map. The Gold Answer clearly shows both elements: the temporal reasoning AND the geographic risk assessment from D-13.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major faithfulness violation. It claims information is 'not contained' in the transcript when it demonstrably is present. The statement that there is no discussion of Strathroy or the Ontario map contradicts P-12 and D-13. This is a clear hallucination about what is NOT in the transcript, which is as problematic as hallucinating content that isn't there.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant. It directly addresses the first part of the question about tick attachment duration calculation, but fails to address the second part about geographic justification. The false claim about missing information makes the response misleading rather than simply incomplete."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the temporal calculation for tick attachment duration (>72 hours based on Friday/Saturday exposure) but contains a critical factual error by claiming the transcript lacks information about Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map. This information is explicitly present in P-12 and D-13, where the geographic location and map consultation are discussed as additional justification for treatment. The answer addresses only half the question and makes false claims about transcript content."
