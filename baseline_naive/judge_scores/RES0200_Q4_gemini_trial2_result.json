  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the test, and the 24-48 hour window for results, all of which match the gold answer and the source transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer addresses all three parts of the question: the alternative diagnosis, the specific test, and the turnaround time. While the gold answer provides a slightly more detailed explanation of which specific symptoms overlapped (including chills), the generated answer's inclusion of cough and shortness of breath is sufficient to explain the rationale.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript. It accurately attributes the information to the correct speaker [D-52] and does not hallucinate any information.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, providing the specific information requested in a structured format without any unnecessary tangents."
