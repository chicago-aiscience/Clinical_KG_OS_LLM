  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that loss of smell, loss of taste, and dry cough began about two days prior and implies simultaneous onset, which matches the transcript/gold answer (P-1, P-2, and confirmed for cough at P-6). However, it incorrectly claims the transcript provides no information about worsening/fluctuation: the patient explicitly says the sensory changes were “pretty consistent” (P-5) and the cough was also “pretty consistent” and not worse (P-8). It also incorrectly says there is no mention of prior similar symptoms; the patient explicitly denies any prior similar episode (“No, no, nothing like this,” P-3). These are substantial contradictions to key gold-answer facts.",
    "completeness": "Covers: simultaneous onset and ~2-day duration.\nMisses: explicit confirmation that cough started at the same time (P-6); explicit lack of fluctuation/worsening for both sensory symptoms (P-5) and cough (P-8); the partial nature of smell/taste loss (P-4); explicit denial of prior similar symptoms (P-3). Overall, it captures only a minority of the required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "While it does not invent new symptoms, it contains multiple statements that are not faithful to the transcript (e.g., asserting there is no information on fluctuation/worsening and no mention of prior similar symptoms when both are directly addressed). These are not mere omissions but misrepresentations of what was said.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to answer the question about symptom timing, progression, and prior history and stays on-topic. The main issue is inaccuracy/omission rather than irrelevance."
