  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the transcript does not provide a reason for the patient's lack of antihypertensive medication. However, the transcript explicitly states in [P-23] and [P-24] that the patient and doctor decided to try lifestyle modifications first (weight loss and walking).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the crucial 'why' requested in the prompt regarding hypertension. It also fails to mention other management strategies included in the Gold Answer, such as smoking cessation and the absence of home oxygen therapy.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness by claiming information is missing from the source text when it is actually present in multiple turns ([P-23], [P-24]).",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address all parts of the question, but it fails to provide the actual information requested for the final part of the prompt, offering a 'not mentioned' disclaimer instead."
