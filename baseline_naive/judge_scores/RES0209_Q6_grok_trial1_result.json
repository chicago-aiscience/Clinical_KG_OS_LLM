  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer explicitly cites D-43 for the clinician's suggestion of 'a little change to your medications'; Generated Answer incorrectly states that 'the specific instruction to change the medication regimen is not explicitly detailed in the provided text excerpts,' which is a significant factual contradiction since D-43 is in the transcript. Additionally, Generated refers to the speaker in D-29 as 'the physician,' but context indicates a trainee clinician consulting a supervising doctor. COVID swab and consultation are correctly identified with accurate citations. Overall, significant factual errors undermine accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) COVID swab (D-29) - covered; 2) explicit medication change suggestion (D-43), noting rescue-only regimen and increased use - partially covered via inference from patient symptoms (P-1, P-8) but misses explicit clinician statement and context like sports goal (D-42); 3) consultation with supervising physician (D-29, D-43), trainee presenting case and returning - partially covered (only D-29 cited, misses full next steps). Covers approximately 60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "COVID swab claim verifiable in D-29; consultation verifiable in D-29 (and D-43, uncited). Medication claims: 'not explicitly detailed' is unverifiable and false as D-43 explicitly states medication change possibility; infers regimen change justification from P-1 (accurate) but hallucinates absence of clinician's direct suggestion. Attribution to 'physician' in D-29 inaccurate. Multiple hallucinated or contradictory elements present.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the question's specified elements (diagnostic test/COVID, medication regimen change, consultation with supervising physician), using bullet points matching the query without tangents or off-topic content."
