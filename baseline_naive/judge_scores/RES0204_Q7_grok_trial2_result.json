  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript lacks information on symptom chronology (cough first for 4-5 days [P-2,P-4], runny nose later for couple days [P-11]), duration, severity changes (stayed the same [P-7]), and prior experiences (novel dry cough, past shorter runny noses [P-24]), directly contradicting the Gold Answer which accurately extracts these facts; thus, it is mostly incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: cough onset 4-5 days ago first symptom, dry/non-productive, unchanged severity, runny nose 2-3 days later with clear discharge, novel dry cough vs prior shorter runny noses; Generated covers 0% of these, instead falsely asserting information is absent.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absences of verifiable transcript details (e.g., durations in P-2/P-4/P-11, severity in P-7, history in P-24), with partial citations (D-5,D-11,D-12) misleadingly used to support false conclusions; largely fabricated claims about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response directly matching question elements (timing, duration, severity, prior comparison) with section headers, perfectly focused on query despite errors; minor off-topic addition of clinical context (x-ray, swab)."
