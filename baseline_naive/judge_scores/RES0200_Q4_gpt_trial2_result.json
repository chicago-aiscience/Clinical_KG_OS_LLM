  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all required elements: it identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis to exclude, specifies the ordered test as a COVID swab, and states the expected result turnaround time as 24–48 hours. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "It includes all key points requested and present in the Gold Answer: (1) alternative diagnosis = COVID-19, (2) test = COVID swab, (3) turnaround = 24–48 hours. It does not add unnecessary details about specific overlapping symptoms (which the Gold notes were not specified by the doctor), and that omission is acceptable because it is not required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript at [D-52]. The brief phrase \"knowledge graph information\" is extraneous, but it does not introduce any new clinical claims. No hallucinated tests, diagnoses, or timelines are included.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time) and does not include off-topic content beyond a minor introductory phrase."
