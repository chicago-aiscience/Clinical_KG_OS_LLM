  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies increased shortness of breath and worsening cough as endorsed symptoms, matching Gold. However, it incorrectly states no systemic symptoms like chills were endorsed (Gold notes chills at [P-29]), misses chest discomfort ([P-13]), and most critically, falsely claims no sputum character change is described despite clear evidence in [P-6] (clear-to-white baseline to yellow this week), which is a core part of the Gold and question. Denials partially match but incomplete. Significant contradictions on key facts like sputum and chills warrant a 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: endorsed worsening cough (baseline/context [P-1,P-5], exertion trigger [P-5]), SOB severity [P-1,P-8], sputum change [P-6], chest discomfort [P-13], chills [P-29]; extensive denials (orthopnea [P-9], PND [P-10], hemoptysis [P-7], palpitations [P-14], fever unmeasured [P-30], and others). Generated covers SOB and cough increase (~30%), partial denials (examples), but misses sputum change, chest discomfort, chills, exertion details, full denial list. Covers 20-49% of key points: score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on SOB and cough verifiable ([P-1,P-5,P-8]). Denial of systemic symptoms/chills unverifiable and incorrect ([P-29] explicitly endorses chills). Sputum claim 'not described' is false hallucination ([P-6] details change). Denials inferred but some directly verifiable (e.g., hemoptysis [P-7]). Citations partial/accurate where used, but multiple fabricated absences contradict transcript. Multiple hallucinated facts: score 2.",
    "relevance": "Structure directly mirrors question (endorsed respiratory/systemic, sputum change, denied symptoms like examples given). Minor issues with inaccuracies but no major tangents; mostly focused on query despite misses: score 4."
