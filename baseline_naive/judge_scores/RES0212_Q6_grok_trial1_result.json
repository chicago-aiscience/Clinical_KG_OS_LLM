  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript only contains patient's dialogue up to [P-23] with no doctor's responses, directly contradicting the full transcript provided (up to [D-48] and [P-48]) and the Gold Answer, which accurately cites [D-47] and [D-48]. It fabricates incompleteness, misstates symptom duration as 'one month' (patient said three months), and wrongly infers chest pain unrelated to doctor's summary. All facts contradict Gold Answer. Score: 1",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: doctor's summary assessment (cough for ~3 months, bad last 3 days, nighttime awakening, greenish sputum no blood, no constitutional symptoms), plan (review story with doctors), next steps (guided by supervising physician). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying possibility and providing irrelevant patient summary. Score: 1",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates transcript incompleteness (only P-1 to P-23, no D segments), despite full transcript with [D-47]/[D-48] containing exact info. References non-existent 'knowledge graph'. Misattributes symptoms (e.g., cough duration, chest pain). Multiple ungrounded claims. Score: 1",
    "relevance": "Directly claims 'not possible to answer' the exact questions (doctor's plan, assessment, next steps info), but then diverges into off-topic patient symptom summary and 'knowledge graph assessment' not addressing query. Partially on-topic refusal but largely irrelevant additions. Score: 2"
