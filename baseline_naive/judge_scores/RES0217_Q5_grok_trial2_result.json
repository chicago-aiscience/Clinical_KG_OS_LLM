  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the tick attachment duration estimation, matching the Gold Answer's explanation using [P-1] and [D-6], with no errors there. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript (citing [D-5], [D-6], [D-17]) and a 'knowledge graph' (not present) contain no information on Strathroy or the Ontario Lyme disease map, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence in [P-12] and [D-13]. This introduces significant factual errors and contradictions on the second half of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: hiking/gardening on Fri/Sat [P-1], uncertainty in attachment time [P-1 implied], discovery 'earlier today' [implied via D-1 context], doctor's >72h estimate [D-6], prophylactic antibiotics [D-6]. Missed entirely: Strathroy location [P-12], doctor's map reference and assessment of Strathroy as 'concerning' [D-13], geographic risk justifying antibiotics [D-13]. Covers ~50% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Duration claims are verifiable in [P-1] and [D-6]. However, assertion that Strathroy/map info is absent is false ([P-12], [D-13] explicitly mention it); citations [D-5/6/17] are irrelevant/misused; 'knowledge graph' is hallucinated (absent from transcript). Multiple unverifiable/contradictory claims indicate hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the first part of the question (attachment duration) with focus. For the second part (Strathroy/map justification), denies existence and pivots to timeline-only rationale, introducing off-topic denial but still engaging the query structure. Partially relevant with notable off-topic element."
