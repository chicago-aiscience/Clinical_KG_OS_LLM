  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the management plan from [D-52], including the COVID-19 swab test, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and supportive care details like hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fevers, and pain relief. Minor discrepancies include omitting the 24-48 hour results timeline, not mentioning the alternative viral illness diagnosis, changing 'NSAIDs' to 'analgesics' (plausible but less precise), and not noting no additional prescriptions, but no major factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic test (swab for COVID-19), self-isolation duration (14 days), contact tracing condition (if positive), supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep well, Tylenol for fevers if any, Tylenol/NSAIDs or equivalent for aches/joints). Missed: results timeline (24-48 hours), alternative diagnosis (viral illness if negative), explicit 'no prescription medications beyond supportive,' and exact phrasing like 'anything like that' or 'NSAIDs' specifically. Covers approximately 85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations; 'analgesics' is a minor interpretive paraphrase of 'NSAIDs' (transcribed as 'anseads'), but no hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question's specified elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), with no off-topic content."
