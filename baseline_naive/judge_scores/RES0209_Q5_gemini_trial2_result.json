  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that information about the three triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) is absent from the transcript, which is factually wrong as they are explicitly discussed in P-9 and P-11. It also falsely claims there is no evidence of the doctor's suspicion of allergies, contradicting D-12 ('OK, so you have allergies too?') and D-13 ('Yeah, that would make sense').",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the primary components of the question (how the triggers and family history relate to the exacerbation and allergy suspicion). It covers general symptoms and family history but misses the specific links provided in the Gold Answer regarding the escalation of inhaler use and the doctor's inquiry into allergies.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations regarding the 'absence' of information. It claims triggers and allergy suspicions aren't in the transcript when they clearly are. It also references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant because it begins by stating the question cannot be answered due to missing information. It then provides a summary of symptoms rather than explaining the relationship between the specific factors requested in the prompt."
