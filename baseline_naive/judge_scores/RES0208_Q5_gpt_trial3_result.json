  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It states there is “no mention” of grandson contact/daycare/cold symptoms, but this is explicitly discussed at [P-23]. It also claims there is “no mention” of travel or in-person client visits; however, travel outside the province is asked and denied at [D-24, P-24], and occupational/client visits are discussed at [P-31] and specifically time-bounded/excluded at [D-32, P-32]. The answer’s remaining summary of symptoms and the doctor’s plan (possible infection/COVID, CXR, swab) is generally consistent with [D-36, D-37], but it fails the core question and contradicts major transcript content.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed: (1) grandchildren visited last weekend; grandson had a cold and attends daycare [P-23]; (2) doctor explored travel outside province and patient denied [D-24, P-24]; (3) doctor explored in-person client visits and patient reported last was a couple weeks ago [D-32, P-32]; (4) conclusion that with other exposures excluded, grandson exposure supports infectious assessment [D-36]. Generated Answer includes only a partial recap of symptoms and planned workup, which is not the requested exposure-history linkage. Overall coverage is far below 20% of required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not faithful to the transcript because it incorrectly asserts the absence of multiple items that are clearly present (grandson/daycare/cold; travel; client visits). This is a major contradiction/misrepresentation of the source rather than a minor omission.",
    "relevance": "The response partially addresses the general idea of how symptoms relate to suspected infection, but it does not answer the question about exposure history and exclusion of other pathways; instead, it incorrectly claims those elements are not in the transcript. Thus it is only minimally relevant to the asked question."
