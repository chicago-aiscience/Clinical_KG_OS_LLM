  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the stuffy and runny nose symptoms and accurately describes the nasal discharge as mostly clear. However, it contains a critical factual error by stating the patient 'did not explicitly deny' the related symptoms. The transcript clearly shows explicit denials: no cough [P-4], no post-nasal drip [P-6], no sore throat [P-7], and no loss of taste/smell [P-16]. The claim about [P-27] being the only denial is factually incorrect.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only about 40% of the key points. It correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy/runny nose) and discharge character (clear). However, it completely misses multiple explicitly denied symptoms documented in the Gold Answer: cough denial, post-nasal drip denial, sore throat denial, shortness of breath denial, fevers/chills denial, and loss of taste/smell denial. It also omits the temporal progression (stuffy first, then mostly running) and other pertinent negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a significant hallucination in its conclusion about denials. While the nasal symptom descriptions are grounded in the transcript, the claim that the patient 'did not explicitly deny any of the specific related symptoms' directly contradicts multiple transcript passages ([P-4], [P-6], [P-7], [P-16]). The reference to [P-27] as the only denial is also incorrect.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses two of the three main components of the question (nasal symptoms and discharge character) but fails to properly address the third critical component about explicitly denied symptoms. Instead of listing the denials, it incorrectly claims none were made. This represents a partial but incomplete response to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient's nasal symptoms (stuffy and runny nose) and discharge character (clear), but contains a critical factual error by claiming the patient did not explicitly deny related symptoms when the transcript clearly documents multiple denials (cough, post-nasal drip, sore throat, loss of taste/smell). The answer covers less than half of the required information and includes hallucinated content that contradicts the transcript."
