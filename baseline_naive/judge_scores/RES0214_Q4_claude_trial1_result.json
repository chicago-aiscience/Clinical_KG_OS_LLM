  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab as the diagnostic test ordered and accurately cites [D-53]. However, it provides an incomplete rationale. The Gold Answer emphasizes the household transmission pattern (husband having similar symptoms) as the key epidemiological reason for prioritizing COVID-19, explicitly citing 'if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out' [D-53]. The Generated Answer only mentions fever and sore throat as symptoms, missing this crucial epidemiological context that was central to the doctor's clinical reasoning.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the basic facts (test ordered and prioritization) but omits several key elements from the Gold Answer: (1) the household transmission pattern as the primary rationale, (2) the husband's week-long similar symptoms [P-19], (3) the self-isolation instructions given to both patient and husband, (4) the explicit mention that influenza was discussed only after COVID-19 rule-out, and (5) the patient's lack of flu shot [P-53]. It covers approximately 40-50% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is grounded in the transcript with accurate citations to [D-53] and [D-54]. The claims made are verifiable, though the interpretation is limited. The statement about 'fever and sore throat' requiring exclusion of infectious causes is somewhat paraphrased from the actual transcript language but remains faithful to the general meaning. No hallucinated facts are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the diagnostic test ordered and the rationale for prioritization. While the rationale is incomplete, the content provided is entirely relevant to the question asked with no off-topic information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test and provides accurate citations, but offers an incomplete rationale that focuses only on symptom presentation while missing the crucial epidemiological context of household transmission that was central to the doctor's decision-making. It covers basic facts but omits approximately 50-60% of key points from the Gold Answer, including household transmission patterns, self-isolation instructions, and the sequential consideration of influenza."
