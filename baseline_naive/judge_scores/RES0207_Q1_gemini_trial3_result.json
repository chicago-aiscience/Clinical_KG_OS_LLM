    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the information in the Gold Answer and the transcript regarding the symptoms it does list (shortness of breath, seizure, and the fever value of 37.4).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key elements from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention the cough as a second respiratory symptom. 2) it omits the underlying epilepsy (neurological context). 3) It does not include the pertinent negatives (no chest pain, no fainting, etc.) which are included in the Gold Answer as part of the clinical presentation.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript with correct citations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request for respiratory and neurological symptoms and the fever measurement, although it is less detailed than the Gold Answer."
