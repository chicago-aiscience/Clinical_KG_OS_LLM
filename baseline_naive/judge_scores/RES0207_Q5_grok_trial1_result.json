  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies medication non-adherence as a risk factor, citing P-9 and P-23 accurately, which aligns with the Gold Answer's coverage of missed Keppra doses. However, it contains significant factual errors by denying any hereditary risk factors and family history, despite the transcript clearly stating at P-26 that 'epilepsy runs in the family. My mom had it,' which the Gold Answer accurately uses to establish genetic predisposition related to the patient's epilepsy diagnosis. This creates direct contradictions with both the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) hereditary risk (epilepsy runs in family, mom had it [P-26]); (2) medication non-adherence (missed Keppra [P-23], reason: daughter's birthday [P-24], infrequent seizures normally [P-9]); (3) relation of family history to patient's epilepsy diagnosis (genetic predisposition). Generated covers only basic medication non-adherence (~25% coverage), misses all hereditary details, family history specifics, and relational explanation.",
    "faithfulness": "Medication claims are verifiable (P-9, P-23). However, it hallucinates absence of hereditary factors and family history despite explicit P-26 evidence; additionally, references a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' not in the transcript, introducing unverifiable external claims. Multiple denials contradict the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around the question's elements (medication-related risks, hereditary risks, family history relation to epilepsy), with no off-topic content, perfectly matching the query focus despite factual inaccuracies."
