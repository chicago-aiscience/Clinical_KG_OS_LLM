  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness, location, and the fact it was 'stuck'). However, it fails significantly on the systemic symptoms. It incorrectly claims the transcript does not contain evidence for screening fever, joint pain, or headaches. In reality, these are explicitly mentioned in [D-7], [D-8], and [D-19]. Furthermore, it misattributes the patient's denials (P-7, P-8, P-19) to drug allergies, whereas those were specific denials of joint pain, fever, and headaches respectively.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first half of the question (local symptoms) well. It fails the second half of the question completely by asserting the information is missing from the source text, thus missing 100% of the key points for the systemic symptoms portion.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major hallucination regarding the content of the transcript. It explicitly states that screening for fever, joint pain, and headaches is not present, when those exact questions are in the text. It also incorrectly maps the patient's responses at [P-7], [P-8], and [P-19] to a different question (drug allergies).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the prompt's structure but provides a 'null' or 'negative' answer for the second half which is factually incorrect based on the provided text, making it only partially relevant as a useful clinical response."
