  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the use of Reactine for seasonal allergies and the absence of prescribed medications, consistent with the Gold Answer. However, it fails to state that the patient receives no treatment for the current respiratory (wheezing) episodes, which is a key part of the question.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers about 60% of the Gold Answer's points. It successfully addresses the allergy medication and the prescription status but misses the specific detail that no medication is given for the current wheezing episodes and that no antibiotics were used for past infections.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims are well-grounded in the transcript with correct citations. However, the mention of a 'knowledge graph' is a minor hallucination/external reference as it is not part of the provided source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for current treatments and prescribed medications, though it ignores the specific 'current respiratory episodes' part of the medication list (which would be 'none')."
