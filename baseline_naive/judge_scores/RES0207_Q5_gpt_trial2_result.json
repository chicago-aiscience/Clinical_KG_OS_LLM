  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies two contributors: (1) hereditary predisposition—epilepsy runs in the family and the patient’s mother had epilepsy [P-26]; and (2) medication non-adherence—missed Keppra dose likely precipitated the seizure [P-9, P-23, P-24]. The Generated Answer correctly notes medication non-adherence and cites [P-9] and Keppra [P-23], which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript provides no hereditary risk factors and no family history. This directly contradicts [P-26] (“epilepsy runs in the family. My mom had it.”). It also introduces “Knowledge Graph confirms…” which is not part of the transcript and is unnecessary to answer the question. Overall, because it denies the key hereditary/family-history element, the answer is significantly incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points: (1) hereditary predisposition with specific maternal history [P-26]; (2) medication-related trigger: missed Keppra dose [P-9, P-23]; (3) context for non-adherence (daughter’s birthday disrupted routine) [P-24]; (4) link to underlying epilepsy diagnosis and seizures usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent [P-9]. The Generated Answer covers only (2) and partially mentions Keppra, but omits (3) and (4) and entirely misses/contradicts (1). Thus it captures well under half of required content.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple statements contradicted by the transcript: it claims no hereditary risk factors and no family history, despite explicit maternal epilepsy history at [P-26]. It also references an external “Knowledge Graph” not present in the source transcript, which is an ungrounded addition. While the medication non-adherence claim is grounded, the hereditary/family-history sections are not faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address medication-related and hereditary risk factors and family history, so it is topically aligned. However, large portions are spent asserting the absence of hereditary/family history (which is wrong) and referencing a “Knowledge Graph,” which is not needed. Still, it is generally aimed at the question."
