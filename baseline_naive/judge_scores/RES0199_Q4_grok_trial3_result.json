  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID (noted as 'covid', minor formatting difference) as the condition to rule out, matching the Gold Answer's 'COVID-19'. It correctly states the swab test and 24-48 hour turnaround time, directly from [D-52]. The alternative diagnosis of 'another viral illness' aligns perfectly with the Gold's phrasing. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Condition: COVID-19 - covered; (2) Test: swab - covered; (3) Turnaround: 24-48 hours - covered; (4) Alternative: another viral illness - covered. 100% coverage of question-specific points; Gold's extras (isolation, contact tracing, management) are not required by question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52]: 'rule out as covid', 'take a swab', '24 to 48 hours', 'not covid, it could be another viral illness'. Citation accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer uses bullet points to precisely address each element of the question (condition, test+time, alternative diagnosis) with no off-topic content or tangents."
