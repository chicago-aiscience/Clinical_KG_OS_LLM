  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript contains no information about medications tried prior to the visit. However, in [P-10], the patient explicitly mentions trying 'decongestants'. Furthermore, it incorrectly identifies the assessment of the medication as 'not improving', whereas the patient actually stated in [P-10] that the decongestant 'worked a little bit' (noting that the nose became runny instead of stuffy). The only correct fact is the doctor's recommendation of Tylenol Cold.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to mention 'decongestants' and the patient's specific assessment of them ('worked a little bit'). It also misses the doctor's recommendation for hydration mentioned in the Gold Answer. It only successfully captures the recommendation for Tylenol Cold.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a hallucination of omission, claiming the transcript lacks information that is clearly present in [P-10]. It attributes the patient's general statement about symptoms from [P-1] to the effectiveness of the medication, which is not what the transcript indicates in response to the specific question about over-the-counter drugs.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to answer all three parts of the user's prompt directly, even though the content provided for the first two parts is inaccurate."
