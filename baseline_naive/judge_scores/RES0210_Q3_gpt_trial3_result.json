  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns with the Gold Answer’s core diagnostic reasoning: productive cough with blood-tinged sputum, systemic infectious symptoms (fever/chills), dyspnea on exertion, and pleuritic right-sided chest pain supporting pneumonia. Minor inaccuracies/overstatements include: calling fever/chills “objective” (they are subjective in the transcript), defining pleuritic pain as typically “sharp” (transcript notes dull baseline pain that worsens with inspiration/cough), and adding “expiration” as a trigger (not stated). It also labels the process “pneumonitis,” which is not necessary and slightly imprecise relative to the pneumonia framing in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) productive cough with abnormal sputum and red spots (blood-tinged), (2) fever and chills, (3) dyspnea on exertion, (4) pleuritic worsening with deep breath/cough supporting pleural involvement.\nKey points missed or under-emphasized vs Gold: explicit purulent “yellow custard” characterization; the chest pain being constant/present even at rest/lying still and described as dull at baseline; localization/right-sided implication for right lung pathology; and smoking history as a predisposing factor. Overall coverage is substantial but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in transcript excerpts (cough, red spots, chills, winded on exertion, right-sided pain worse with deep breath/cough). However, there are some additions not directly supported by the transcript: “objective” fever, the typical characterization of pleuritic pain as “sharp,” and worsening with “expiration.” These are plausible clinical generalizations but not transcript-derived, lowering strict faithfulness slightly.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on identifying transcript findings supporting lower respiratory tract infection/pneumonia and explicitly explains how pleuritic chest pain supports that reasoning. No meaningful irrelevant tangents."
