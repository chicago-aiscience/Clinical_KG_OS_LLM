  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors by repeatedly claiming that specific details are 'not provided' or 'not specified' when they are explicitly stated in the transcript and the Gold Answer. Specifically, it misses that the cough was dry [P-12], diarrhea occurred 5-6 times a day [P-28], vomiting occurred twice [P-32], and the headache severity was a 7/10 [P-8].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover almost all key points requested in the prompt. It does not provide the nature of the cough, the frequency of diarrhea, the number of vomiting episodes, or the headache severity rating, all of which were core requirements of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates a failure to ground its claims in the provided transcript. It incorrectly asserts that information is missing despite it being present in the text (negative hallucination).",
    "relevance": "While the answer identifies the correct symptom categories, it fails to answer the specific 'what' and 'how many' components of the user's question, essentially providing a 'no information' response for every specific query."
