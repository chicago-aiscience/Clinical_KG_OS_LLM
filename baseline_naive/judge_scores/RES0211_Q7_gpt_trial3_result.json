  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes the 3–4 day duration (P-1, P-3), the presence of scratchy throat and dry cough (P-1, P-4), headache (P-1, P-2), and that feeling hot was persistent day and night (P-7, P-9). However, it incorrectly states that Jessica first noticed a dry cough (or cough and throat together) as the initial symptom; the transcript explicitly says she first noticed a scratchy throat and then started coughing (P-4). It also asserts that feeling hot began concurrently with the onset of cough/throat symptoms and ‘likely began alongside’ them, whereas the Gold Answer correctly states the transcript does not specify exactly when the hot sensation began relative to throat/cough onset.",
    "completeness": "It captures several key elements (initial scratchy throat/dry cough, headache, and the constant feeling hot). It misses or underrepresents other Gold Answer points: general malaise/feeling crappy (P-1, P-14) and fatigue/tiredness (P-13). It also fails to include the Gold Answer’s important nuance that the exact onset of feeling hot relative to throat/cough is not specified, instead replacing it with an unsupported conclusion.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or contradict the transcript: (1) claiming the dry cough was the first noticed symptom conflicts with P-4; (2) stating the hot sensation was concurrent with onset and ‘likely’ began alongside the initial symptoms is an inference not supported by the transcript (which does not time-stamp when feeling hot began). Other parts (duration, persistence of hot sensation, headache) are supported.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on symptom order over the 3–4 days and explicitly addresses how the ‘feeling hot’ symptom relates to the cough/throat timeline."
