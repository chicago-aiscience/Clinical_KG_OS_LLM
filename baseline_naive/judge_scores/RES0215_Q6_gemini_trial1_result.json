  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely incorrect. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain the doctor's plan for next steps, which is factually wrong; turn [D-58] clearly outlines a physical exam, a consultation with a physician, and a follow-up discussion. Additionally, it identifies only one environmental factor (air filters), whereas the gold answer and transcript list several others including smoking, carpets, pets, and fireplaces.",
    "completeness": "The answer is highly incomplete. It misses all three components of the doctor's plan (exam, consultation, follow-up) and omits approximately 80% of the environmental factors assessed (smoking status, carpets, pets, and wood-burning appliances).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source text by claiming information is missing when it is present in the final turn of the doctor. While it correctly identifies 'air filters' from the transcript, the overall assessment of the document's content is inaccurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the two parts of the prompt but fails to provide the requested information, instead providing a 'not found' response for the primary part of the question despite the information being available in the text."
