  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states no medications for current respiratory episodes (resolve on own, [P-33,P-34]), occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies ([P-35,P-36]), no prescribed medications ([P-36,P-46,P-47]), and no antibiotics for past viral infections ([P-16]). Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine/OTC for seasonal allergies and no prescribed meds ([P-36]), but omits explicit statement on no treatment for current episodes and past infections; adds unverified claim about Reactine being OTC via 'knowledge graph' (accurate fact but not from transcript). Core facts match, minor omissions and extra detail: score 4.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: 1) No meds for current episodes; 2) Occasional OTC Reactine for allergies; 3) No prescribed meds; 4) No antibiotics for past infections. Generated covers 2 and 3 (~50%), misses 1 and 4 explicitly: score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on Reactine/OTC for allergies and no prescribed grounded in [P-36]; accurate citations. However, 'supported by the knowledge graph, which indicates Reactine is an over-the-counter treatment' references non-existent knowledge graph in transcript (hallucination); Reactine as OTC plausible but externally sourced, not verifiable in transcript: score 3.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly lists medications/treatments taken (Reactine/OTC for allergies, no prescribed), addressing question on meds for current/other conditions and prescribed status; minor extraneous knowledge graph mention but focused: score 5."
