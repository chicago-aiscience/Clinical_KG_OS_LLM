  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error regarding chest pain. It states the patient denied pain 'associated with the cough,' whereas the transcript (P-3) explicitly states it 'kinda hurts when I cough.' It also omits crucial details from the gold answer such as the duration (3 months), the subjective fevers (feeling hot at night), and the specific absence of blood or foul smell in the sputum.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is highly incomplete. It covers only about 25-30% of the key points found in the gold answer. It misses the timeline of the cough (3 months), the change from dry to productive, the subjective fever, the impact on exercise, and nearly the entire list of 'denied' symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer misinterprets P-19 (general body pain/tenderness) to claim a denial of cough-related pain, while ignoring the patient's actual statement in P-3. This leads to a claim that contradicts the transcript. Other symptoms mentioned (greenish sputum, fatigue, sleep disturbance) are grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question asked, focusing on reported symptoms, sputum characteristics, and denials, even though it fails to capture the breadth and accuracy required."
