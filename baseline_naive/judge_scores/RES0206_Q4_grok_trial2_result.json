  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19) and the test (COVID swab with citation [D-43]), matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that 'the transcript does not explicitly list details regarding the patient's recent social contacts,' directly contradicting [P-20] where the patient describes meeting friends to walk dogs, one being sick, and walking too close sometimes. Instead, it attributes consideration to symptoms like fever and sputum, which are present but not the specific prompting detail for COVID per the Gold Answer and question focus. This is a significant factual error on the key third element.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Condition: COVID-19; (2) Test: COVID swab [D-43]; (3) Prompting detail: social contacts with sick friend during dog walks, too close despite outdoors [P-20], unsure if tested [P-21]; additional context on symptom screening/travel. Generated covers (1) and (2) accurately (~50%), but completely misses (3) and provides incorrect alternative (symptoms), covering <50% of key points overall.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about condition and test are verifiable [D-43]. However, assertion that transcript lacks explicit social contact details is false/hallucinated, as [D-20/P-20/D-21/P-21] directly describe the exposure prompting COVID consideration. Attribution to symptoms (fever [P-9], sputum [P-1]) is verifiable but not the specific reason for COVID ruling out; introduces misinterpretation as primary prompt. Multiple discrepancies from transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses condition and test parts of the question. For the social contacts detail, denies existence in transcript and substitutes symptoms, introducing off-topic alternative reasoning instead of the requested exposure history, making it only partially relevant."
