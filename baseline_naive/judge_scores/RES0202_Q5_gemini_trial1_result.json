  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with both the transcript and the gold answer. It accurately identifies the mother's concern about school being the source, the symptom onset timeline, the lack of outside sick contacts, and the fact that the school had not notified the family of exposures.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the core components of the question (source, contacts, and notification). However, it misses several key details present in the gold answer that provide a more complete picture: the school's requirement for a COVID test to return, and the exclusion of other possible sources (travel and environmental factors) which reinforced the school as the primary suspect.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely faithful to the source transcript. All information provided regarding the timeline of symptoms and the mother's reports on sick contacts can be directly traced back to the dialogue without any hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing strictly on the specific questions asked about school attendance, sick contacts, and notifications without including unnecessary tangents."
