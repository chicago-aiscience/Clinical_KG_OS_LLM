  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor 'did not systematically explore' the patient's living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence (e.g., D-45 to D-50 explicitly cover these). Core facts are wrong, with the Generated Answer fabricating a lack of inquiry. Score: 1.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include living situation [P-45], environmental triggers [D-46/P-46], sick contacts [D-47/P-47], workplace [P-48/D-50/P-50], travel [D-49/P-49], substance use, and no clear source; Generated Answer covers none of these, instead denying all exploration. Covers <20%. Score: 1.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates absence of questions on exposures despite clear transcript evidence (D-45: living; D-46: environment; D-47: sick contacts; D-48: work; D-49: travel; D-50: sick at work); misinterprets D-52 as sole focus, fabricating that no specific questions were asked. Largely fabricated. Score: 1.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by claiming no systematic exploration of the specified sources, with focused denial and citation to D-52, no off-topic content. Score: 5."
