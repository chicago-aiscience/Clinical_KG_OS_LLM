  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition and the COVID-19 test as the diagnostic tool. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the timing of the test relative to symptom onset. Transcript [P-36] explicitly states: 'I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific timing of the test relative to onset (stating it is unavailable). Regarding workplace concerns, it only mentions that coworkers are scared, missing the facts that the patient is a hospital clerk, wears PPE, and is anxious about returning to the hospital environment without coughing.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the transcript 'does not explicitly specify' the timing of the test is a failure of grounding, as the information is present in [P-36]. The other points provided are grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the multi-part question, although its response to the timing and workplace concerns is inaccurate or incomplete."
