  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the planned supervisory consult (“go grab/get the doctor I’m working with”) and the two proposed diagnostics (possible chest X‑ray and COVID nasal swab) and the intent to return to discuss next steps. However, it adds an unsupported detail that the doctor will “communicate the results” to the family; in the transcript the clinician only commits to arranging tests and returning to discuss next steps, not specifically reviewing results. It also implies tests are ordered only after the consultation, whereas the transcript frames them as likely/standard (“might want” X‑ray; “should probably do” COVID swab) and that they will be arranged before returning with the supervising physician.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) supervising physician involvement/consult, (2) chest X‑ray proposed, (3) COVID swab planned, (4) return to family to discuss “where to go from here/next steps.” Missed/minimized: (a) the initial visit structure including performing an exam of lungs and heart before getting the supervising doctor, (b) the age-appropriate explanations and reassurance about X‑ray and discomfort of swab, and (c) the closing thanks. Overall coverage is partial rather than complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (supervising consult, chest X‑ray possibility, COVID swab). The claim about returning to “communicate the results” is not stated in the transcript, and the sequencing (“following the consultation… order tests”) is somewhat interpretive rather than explicitly supported. These are minor-to-moderate extrapolations but not wholesale fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked components: diagnostic tests, supervisory consultation, and follow-up steps for the patient and mother, with minimal extraneous content."
