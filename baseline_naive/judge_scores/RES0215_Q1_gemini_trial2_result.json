  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the respiratory symptoms mentioned in the transcript (wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, difficulty taking deep breaths). However, it identifies only 'wheezing' as the earliest symptom, whereas the gold answer (following P-2) correctly identifies both wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths as the earliest signs observed four to five days ago.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the primary list of symptoms but misses several key nuances present in the gold answer. Specifically, it omits the mother's denial of cyanosis (not turning blue), the non-productive nature of the cough (no phlegm), and the general observation that the child 'looks fine otherwise.' It also misses 'difficulty taking deep breaths' as one of the earliest symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. All symptom reports and the timeline for wheezing are accurately cited from the provided turns [P-1], [P-2], [P-3], and [P-32]. The inclusion of a 'Knowledge Graph' note is a minor structural addition but the content remains faithful to the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question: the specific symptoms at presentation and the identification of the earliest symptoms."

  "summary": "The generated answer is accurate and well-cited, but it is less complete than the gold answer, omitting negative clinical findings (no phlegm/cyanosis) and failing to include 'difficulty taking deep breaths' as a co-earliest symptom."
