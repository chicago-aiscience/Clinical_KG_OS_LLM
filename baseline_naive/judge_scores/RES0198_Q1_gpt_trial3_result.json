  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the patient’s nasal symptoms (stuffy nose and runny nose for ~1 week) and correctly describes the discharge as mostly clear. However, it is substantially incorrect in stating the patient did not explicitly deny sore throat, cough, post-nasal drip, or loss of taste/smell—these were explicitly denied in the transcript ([P-4], [P-6], [P-7], [P-16]). It also mischaracterizes [P-27] as a denial about “concerns related to their diabetes,” when it was a denial of taking other medications besides insulin. These are major errors affecting the core of the question (denied related symptoms).",
    "completeness": "Includes: (1) nasal congestion/stuffy nose and runny nose; (2) clear discharge. Missing: explicit denials of cough, post-nasal drip/back-of-throat drainage, sore throat, shortness of breath, fevers/chills, and loss of taste/smell. Also omits the evolution from initially stuffy to mostly running. Overall, it covers only a minority of the key requested items (especially the denied symptoms).",
    "faithfulness": "Some content is grounded (stuffy/runny nose; clear discharge). But it makes multiple claims contradicted by the transcript: it says none of the listed related symptoms were explicitly denied, when several were. It also introduces an unsupported/incorrect interpretation about [P-27] being a diabetes-related concern. These issues indicate notable unfaithfulness to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured around the exact elements asked (nasal symptoms, discharge character, and denied related symptoms). While it contains incorrect statements and a minor irrelevant diabetes-related comment, it is still largely focused on the question."

  "summary": "Accurately reports congestion/rhinorrhea and clear discharge, but incorrectly claims no relevant symptom denials and adds misinterpreted content, leading to low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness despite being generally on-topic."
