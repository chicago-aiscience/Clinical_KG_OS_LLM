  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. The transcript clearly shows the doctor DID ask about living situation [D-45/P-45], environmental exposures [D-46/P-46], contact with sick individuals [D-47/P-47], workplace [D-48/P-48], travel history [D-49/P-49], and whether coworkers were sick [D-50/P-50]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states these questions were not asked, directly contradicting the transcript evidence.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not mention: the apartment living situation, environmental exposure questions (carpets, dust, mold, pets), the car dealership workplace, lunch room exposure, absence of sick coworkers, negative travel history, or substance use screening. Coverage is essentially 0% of the required content.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript by claiming the doctor 'did not systematically explore' exposure sources when turns D-45 through D-50 clearly document this systematic exploration. The claim that 'specific questions regarding potential sources of exposure were not asked' is a hallucination that directly contradicts verifiable transcript content.",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer addresses the question about exposure source exploration, it provides an incorrect answer. It focuses on COVID-19 testing and management rather than documenting the systematic exposure history that was actually taken. The response is topically relevant but factually wrong."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect, claiming the doctor did not explore exposure sources when the transcript clearly documents systematic exploration of living situation, workplace, travel, and sick contacts in turns D-45 through D-50. This represents a complete failure in accuracy and completeness, with hallucinated content contradicting the source material."
