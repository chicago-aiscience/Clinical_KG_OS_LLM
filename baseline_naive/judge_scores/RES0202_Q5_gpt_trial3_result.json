{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer’s core facts: (1) mother suspected school as a possible source of COVID exposure [P-2] with symptoms starting after returning from school Wednesday [P-1]; (2) she reported no known sick contacts outside of school [P-38]; (3) for school, she did not identify any known sick contact and said it was hard to say due to school attendance [P-38]; and (4) the school had not contacted them about any exposures [P-39]. No contradictions with the Gold Answer were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: suspected school-based source; onset after school; no known sick contacts outside school; uncertainty about school contacts; no school notification of exposures. \nKey Gold point missed: the mother’s additional statement that a COVID test was needed to return to school so the school could manage/notify other families about exposure [P-41]. (Gold also mentions no travel/environmental exposures, which are not central to the question.) Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are supported by the transcript. It appropriately notes lack of specific identified sick contacts at school (consistent with mother’s “kinda hard to say” [P-38]) and correctly states the school did not notify them [P-39]. No apparent hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on how school attendance related to suspected source and what was reported about sick contacts at school vs outside school, including school notification—directly addressing the question with minimal extraneous content."
