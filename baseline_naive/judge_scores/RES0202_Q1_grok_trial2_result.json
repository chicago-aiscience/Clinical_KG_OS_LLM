  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports some symptoms like dry cough (with citations), fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, and suspected loss of taste, matching Gold and transcript. However, it misses runny nose [P-16], decreased appetite nuance [P-15], and shortness of breath uncertainty [P-8]. Critically, it incorrectly states that none of the specific symptoms (wheezing [P-7], sore throat [P-14], chest pain/heart racing [P-13], chills [P-19], GI complaints [P-22, P-23]) were explicitly asked about or denied by the mother, directly contradicting the transcript and Gold Answer's list of pertinent negatives. It also misattributes some inquiries to D-44 (future worsening) instead of earlier denials. Significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers key reported symptoms partially: cough, fever, fatigue, appetite/taste (4/7 from Gold). Misses runny nose, SOB uncertainty completely. For denied symptoms, covers 0% of Gold's list (sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, rashes, GI issues, etc.), instead claiming none were asked/denied and listing irrelevant future symptoms from D-44. Swallowing uncertainty noted but incomplete. Overall covers ~25-30% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable for reported symptoms (e.g., cough [P-1,P-5], fever [P-1,P-2], fatigue [P-1,P-25], taste/appetite [P-17]). However, hallucinates that wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, GI were not asked/denied (explicitly denied in P-7,P-13,P-14,P-19,P-22,P-23). Misinterprets D-44 as inquiries about past symptoms (it's advice for worsening). Adds unverified 'patient reported' phrasing and lists non-denied future risks as asked/denied. Multiple hallucinated facts about denials.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the question with sections for reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and explicitly asked/denied symptoms, using bullet points and citations. Minor extraneous details from D-44 but no major tangents; perfectly focused despite errors."
