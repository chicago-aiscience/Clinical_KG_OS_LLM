  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the mother's suspicion of COVID from school [P-2] and the timeline post-school attendance [P-1], correctly states no known sick contacts outside school per [P-38], and notes no school notification per [P-39]; however, it simplifies the nuance of 'kinda hard to say' for school contacts [P-38] and omits supporting details like no travel [P-40] and no environmental exposures [P-37], leading to minor discrepancies from the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: School as suspected source [P-1,P-2], no known sick contacts outside school [P-38], no specific known school contacts, no school notification [P-39]. Missed: Precise phrasing from [P-38] ('we know for sure not outside' and 'kinda hard to say' for school), school's COVID test requirement for return [P-41], no recent travel [P-40], no environmental exposures [P-37]. Covers approximately 60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript: school suspicion [P-2], timeline [P-1], no outside contacts [P-38], no specific school contacts or notifications [P-38,P-39]; citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question, with sections on suspected source (school attendance), sick contacts (school vs. outside), and school notifications, containing no off-topic content."
