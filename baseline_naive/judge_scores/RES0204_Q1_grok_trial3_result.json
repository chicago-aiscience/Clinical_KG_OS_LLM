  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and accurately describes the cough as dry and non-productive, matching the Gold Answer and transcript (D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6). However, it inaccurately implies the patient initially described the cough as dry ('you said it was a dry cough'), when the doctor introduced the term and the patient agreed; it also omits durations, stability, and exact nasal discharge details ('pretty clear'), leading to minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: cough as dry/non-productive (partial, cites D-5 but misses explicit non-productive confirmation in D-6/P-6), runny nose reported. Missed: cough duration (4-5 days), cough unchanged, runny nose duration (couple days), nasal discharge explicitly 'pretty clear', patient's history comment (P-24), pertinent negatives (sore throat, chest pain, no SOB/wheeze). Covers approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in the transcript: cough dry confirmed in D-5/P-5; non-productive inferred from dry and explicitly supported later (D-6/P-6); runny nose in D-11/P-11; assessment of nasal characteristics directly from D-12 questions. Quote from D-5 is accurate. No hallucinations, though nasal answer ('pretty clear' P-12) not reported.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists the respiratory symptoms and their characteristics in bullet points, perfectly addressing the question about symptoms, cough nature (productive/non-productive), and nasal discharge appearance with no off-topic content."
