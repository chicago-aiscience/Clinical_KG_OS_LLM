  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the transcript does not provide a reason for the patient not taking antihypertensive medication. However, the transcript explicitly states in [P-23] that she decided to try lifestyle changes first. It also fails to mention the specific management strategies like weight loss and walking that the Gold Answer includes.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific lifestyle strategies (weight loss, daily walking), the fact that she does not use home oxygen, and her smoking cessation history. It also fails to provide the reason for her medication status, which was a specific part of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates a lack of faithfulness by stating information is missing when it is clearly present in the source text (specifically [P-23] regarding lifestyle choices and [P-24] regarding weight loss and walking). It also incorrectly cites [P-1] for inhaler frequency, as that information is only found in [P-26].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to address every component of the multi-part question (medications, management, frequency, and reasons for medication status). However, the quality of the content within those sections is poor."
