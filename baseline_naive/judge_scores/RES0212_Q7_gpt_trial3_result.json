  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual inaccuracies versus the Gold Answer/transcript. It incorrectly states the cough began ~1 month ago, whereas the patient reports an intermittent cough for ~3 months (P-2, P-13) with sleep disruption only in the last month (P-19, P-21). It also omits the key timing that the cough became productive about 3 days prior (P-12) and incorrectly states there was no mention of subjective fevers, despite the patient reporting feeling “hot at night” in the past couple of days (P-4). While it correctly notes greenish sputum (P-9) and that sleep disruption has been about a month (P-19/P-21), the overall timeline is substantially wrong.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) sleep disruption began ~1 month ago; (2) sputum is greenish. Key elements missed/incorrect: (1) initial onset ~3 months ago during pole dancing class; (2) dry/intermittent course for ~2 months; (3) productive “gunk” started ~3 days before presentation; (4) subjective fevers started in the last couple of days; (5) explicit distinction that nightly waking was not present for the full 3 months. Overall, less than half of the required timeline details are correctly captured.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: the claim that cough onset was ~1 month is contradicted by the patient’s explicit “I’ve…had a cough for like three months” (P-2). The claim that there is no mention of subjective fever is contradicted by P-4. The sputum description is grounded, but the answer fails to ground timing details and includes contradictory conclusions relative to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked timeline elements (onset, sleep disruption, productivity, fevers) and does not add major irrelevant information. However, it omits/gets wrong multiple required timepoints."
