  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three OTC medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), their lack of effectiveness, and the use of a multivitamin as the regular supplement. These facts are fully consistent with the gold answer and the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary medications and supplements requested. However, it misses a few points included in the Gold Answer: the explicit confirmation that the patient takes no prescription medications, and the details regarding the patient's attempt to quit smoking (as part of their routine/habit). It does include running, which is part of the routine mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript. The citations [P-6, P-25, P-28] are accurate and correspond to the relevant sections of the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question. It organizes the information logically into categories (OTC, effectiveness, supplements)."
