{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 (referred to as 'Covid') as the alternative diagnosis, cites the correct reason of symptom overlap (cough and shortness of breath matching the transcript and Gold), specifies the COVID swab as the test, and states the 24-48 hour turnaround time, all fully consistent with the Gold Answer with no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), symptom overlap mention [D-52], specific test (COVID swab [D-52]), turnaround time (24-48 hours [D-52]). Gold's additional details on unspecified symptoms and patient chills are explanatory but not core to the question; all question-answering points fully covered, no misses.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript: overlap of symptoms with Covid, ordering covid swab, results in 24-48 hours. Symptoms listed (cough, SOB) align with patient's report and doctor's reference to 'your symptoms'; no hallucinations or unverifiable additions despite mention of 'knowledge graph'.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is perfectly structured and focused, directly addressing the three-part question (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time) with no off-topic content or tangents."
