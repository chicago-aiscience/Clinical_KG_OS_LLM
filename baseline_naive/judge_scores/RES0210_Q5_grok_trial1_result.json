  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that specific details about the patient's smoking history (pack-a-day starting at age 15) and occupational role (engineering consultant at a chemical plant) were not elicited during the consultation, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and the transcript evidence [P-37, P-38, P-33, P-34]. It partially covers family history but omits the grandfather being a 'big smoker too' [P-42]. Instead, it shifts focus to symptoms, fabricating relations via a non-existent 'knowledge graph.' Core facts about risk factors and their elicitation are wrong, leading to a major contradiction with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Smoking details [P-37, P-38] and relation to impaired clearance/infection/COPD/cancer; (2) Occupational details [P-33, P-34] and mitigated chemical exposure; (3) Family history details [P-42] and genetic risk; (4) Collective relevance to hemoptysis/presentation needing malignancy vigilance. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, denying two risks outright and ignoring their relations, while adding unrelated symptom summary. Only superficial family mention (~10% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims of non-elicited smoking/occupation details are false per transcript [P-36-P-38, P-33-P-34]. Family history partially verifiable [P-42] but incomplete. Multiple hallucinations: repeated 'knowledge graph' references not in transcript; links symptoms to unmentioned KG. Symptom claims mostly verifiable but irrelevant. Largely ungrounded with fabricated absences and additions.",
    "relevance": "Question requires relating three specified risks to presentation and detailing their elicitation. Generated denies two risks' elicitation (off-topic denial), minimally addresses family, and pivots to exhaustive symptom list (tangential). Fails to address risk relations or full elicitation, largely off-topic."
