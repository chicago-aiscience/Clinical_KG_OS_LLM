  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Condition ruled out: Correctly identifies COVID-19 as ruled out, consistent with the patient saying they had a COVID test and \"don't have it\" [P-35].\n- Specific test: Correctly identifies a COVID(-19) test.\n- Timing: Incorrect. The transcript *does* specify timing relative to symptom onset: the patient had the test \"when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago\" [P-36]. The generated answer states the transcript does not specify this.\n- Workplace-related concerns: Partially correct (coworkers scared when patient coughs [P-35]) but misses other workplace-related context emphasized in the gold answer (hospital clerk role, PPE/infection-control context, staying home and wanting to return without coughing).",
    "completeness": "Key elements required by the question/gold answer:\n- COVID-19 ruled out: Covered.\n- COVID test used: Covered.\n- When performed relative to symptom onset (at onset ~2 weeks prior): Missed/incorrectly denied.\n- Workplace concerns making exclusion important: Partially covered (coworkers scared) but missing: works at hospital (clerk), PPE/heightened infection-control environment, stayed home awaiting improvement, wants to return but not coughing.\nOverall, the answer includes roughly half or less of the needed workplace/timing details.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are grounded in the transcript (COVID test/negative; coworkers scared).\n- However, it adds an unverifiable element: \"Supported by Knowledge Graph\" with a procedure→rules out→diagnosis relation not present in the transcript.\n- It also claims the transcript doesn't specify timing, which is not faithful to [P-36].",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses all parts of the question (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns), but provides an incorrect timing statement and incomplete workplace rationale; still largely on-topic without major tangents."
