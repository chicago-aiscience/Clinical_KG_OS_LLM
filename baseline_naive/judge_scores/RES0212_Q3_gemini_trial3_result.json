  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as a bacterial lower respiratory tract infection (Pneumonia). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the transcript: it claims the transcript does not explicitly contain the word 'fever,' whereas the word 'fevers' is used twice in [D-4]. Furthermore, it uses fatigue/sleep as evidence for fever instead of the patient's direct response in [P-4] about 'feeling hot at night.' It also misses the 'acute-on-chronic' nuance (3 months vs 3 days) mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three requested clinical features but misses several key nuances from the Gold Answer: 1) The temporal relationship of the cough (three-month duration vs. three-day acute worsening), 2) The significance of missing constitutional symptoms (night sweats/weight loss) to rule out other conditions, and 3) The synthesis provided by the doctor in the transcript summary [D-47].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on faithfulness by claiming the word 'fever' is absent from the transcript. This is a clear hallucination/omission since [D-4] explicitly asks about 'fevers.' By ignoring [P-4], where the patient confirms feeling 'hot at night,' and instead citing [P-19] (fatigue), the answer misattributes the clinical evidence available in the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant to the question asked, focusing on the diagnosis and the three specific clinical features requested."
