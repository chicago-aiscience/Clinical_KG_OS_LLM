  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the 3-day timeline, the specific symptoms (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea), the worsening trend, and the doctor's assessment of an infection-triggered exacerbation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a crucial component of the Gold Answer: the specific comparison to prior exacerbations. While the Gold Answer highlights that this is the patient's 'worst' episode [P-3] and mentions her history of two ER visits without hospitalization [P-5, P-6], the generated answer only compares the current state to her baseline of being well-managed. It fails to mention the patient's self-assessment of this being her most severe episode to date.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All claims regarding symptoms, timelines, and the doctor's interpretation are supported by the provided text with no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's questions regarding symptom evolution and the trend of the illness. However, its response to the comparison with prior exacerbations is slightly less focused on the historical frequency/severity (ER visits) and more on the deviation from daily baseline."
