  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the core management elements from [D-52]: COVID-19 swab testing, 14-day isolation, and that public health contact tracing would occur if the test is positive. Supportive care advice (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever) is also correct. The main factual discrepancy is the substitution of “Tylenol or analgesics” for “Tylenol or NSAIDs” for muscle/joint aches; this is directionally similar but not the specific medication class stated in the transcript/Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: COVID swab; isolate 14 days; public health contact tracing if positive; supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever); pain relief with Tylenol (partial). Missing/less complete elements from Gold Answer: expected test turnaround time of 24–48 hours; the explicit note that if not COVID it could be another viral illness going around; and the specific mention of NSAIDs (replaced by the broader term “analgesics”). Overall this is ~60–75% of the Gold Answer’s management-plan details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly grounded in [D-52]. The only notable looseness is “Tylenol or analgesics,” which is not verbatim and omits the explicitly stated “NSAIDs,” making that portion partially unverifiable as written. No major hallucinated additions beyond that broadening.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what the question asks for (test ordered, isolation duration, when contact tracing occurs, and supportive care recommendations) and does not introduce irrelevant content."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and highly relevant, but not fully complete because it omits the 24–48 hour result timeframe and the alternative viral-illness note, and it paraphrases NSAIDs imprecisely as “analgesics.”"
