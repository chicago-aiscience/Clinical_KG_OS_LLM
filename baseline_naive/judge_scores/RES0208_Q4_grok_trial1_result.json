  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly mention symptoms like chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, despite clear evidence in the transcript (e.g., D-10/P-10 for runny nose, D-15/P-15 for nausea, D-16/P-16 for chest pain, D-17/P-17 for palpitations). It misidentifies cough as explicitly negated (patient indicates it might be starting, P-7/P-8), cites incorrectly (e.g., D-36 for cough, P-9 wrongly for smell), and ignores most Gold-listed denied symptoms (runny nose, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness). Differentiation explanations contradict Gold by focusing on positives and inferring rather than using pertinent negatives, and it fabricates a definitive COVID diagnosis vs. doctor's 'some sort of infection, COVID not ruled out'. Overall, mostly incorrect and contradictory to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: lists 8 specific denied symptoms with citations (runny nose/congestion, vision/hearing, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary, numbness/tingling); explains differentiation (excludes cardiac via no chest pain/palps, GI via no nausea/abdo pain, common cold via no runny nose, neuro via no neuro sx, supports respiratory infection/COVID). Generated covers none of these accurately: mentions cough (not negated, not in Gold list), smell (not negated), infers absences without listing/citing; differentiation vague, focuses on positives like fatigue/SOB, mentions KG (irrelevant). Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates transcript lacks explicit mentions of key symptoms (false, directly in D-10 to D-22); wrong citations (D-36/P-8 for cough denial - D-7/D-8 shows possible emerging cough; P-9 is sore throat, not smell); invents 'knowledge graph' not in transcript/input; claims denial of 'significant coughing' (patient says 'haven't really been coughing much' but 'maybe starting'); infers absences without transcript verification; attributes COVID diagnosis definitively (transcript: 'can't rule out covid'). Multiple hallucinated facts and unverifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "Addresses question parts (symptoms negated, differentiation role) with sections, but content off-topic due to wrong symptoms (cough/smell), KG references, focus on positive COVID symptoms instead of negatives' differentiating role, and inferred vs. explicit negations. Partially relevant with significant off-topic/wrong content."
