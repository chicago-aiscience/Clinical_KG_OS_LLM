  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the quality as 'very sharp and strong' worsening on deep breath (matches Gold [P-3]), episode duration as 20 minutes (matches [P-6]), and occurrence during studying and walking to school (matches [P-4]). However, it introduces a minor discrepancy by suggesting nervousness about running implies physical exertion as a trigger, which contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer where the patient denies worsening with exercise and attributes reluctance to schoolwork ([P-10, P-28]). Core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: quality (sharp/strong on deep breath), episode duration (20 min), occurrence during studying/walking. Missed: total duration (1.5 weeks [P-2]), initial description as uncomfortable/odd, intermittent 'here and there' nature emphasized, occurs when alone/resting, resolves/unnoticed when with people/talking/hands-on tasks ([P-9, P-29]), not worse with exercise, no injury, first occurrence. Covers core requested elements partially but misses resolve situations and several supporting details, approximately 50-60% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about quality [P-3], duration [P-6], and situations [P-4] are directly verifiable in transcript. The addition of 'feeling nervous about running lately, suggesting physical exertion may be a trigger' is a misinterpretation/hallucination; transcript shows reluctance due to schoolwork, not pain trigger, and explicitly no worsening with exercise/walking ([P-10, P-28]). Minor hallucinated inference, otherwise grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around quality, duration, and situations/triggers as asked, using bullet points for clarity. Minor tangent in suggesting exertion trigger, but overall focused on question without off-topic content."
