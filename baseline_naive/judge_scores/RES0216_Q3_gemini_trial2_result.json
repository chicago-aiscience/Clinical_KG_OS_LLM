  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the top differential diagnosis and the main symptoms (chest tightness, dyspnea on exertion) and medical history (asthma) used to reach it. It also correctly notes the exclusion of cardiac causes due to the absence of pain. However, it misses the specific detail from the Gold Answer regarding the patient's medication non-adherence (skipping the evening dose), which was a key part of the doctor's reasoning for why the asthma was recurring.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers several key points: history of asthma, presenting symptoms, and the exclusion of cardiac issues. However, it misses several nuances present in the Gold Answer: 1) The specific mention of skipping the evening maintenance dose and lack of a rescue inhaler; 2) The absence of new environmental triggers; 3) The patient's own suspicion that it might be related to asthma despite feeling 'different'.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It correctly cites the patient's mention of salbutamol (P-25) and the symptoms (P-1, P-7). It does not hallucinate information outside of the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is entirely relevant to the question, focusing specifically on the symptoms, history, and the doctor's logic in linking them to the diagnosis."
