  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition as 'cardiac ischemic pictures' and accurately cites the doctor's reasoning from the transcript (lack of pain, presence of tightness, and not getting out of breath). This aligns perfectly with the facts presented in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the majority of the points but misses a specific subset of 'absent symptoms' mentioned in the Gold Answer: the denial of anxiety, sweating, or a feeling of impending doom (from P-6 and D-6). While it captures the main evidence cited in D-36, it is less comprehensive than the Gold Answer regarding the pertinent negatives screened earlier in the session.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript. The citations [D-36], [P-1], and [P-5] (though labeled [P-1] and [P-5] implicitly) are accurate and grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the prompt: the specific condition and the symptom findings (nature and absence)."
