  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states assessment includes symptoms consistent with COVID and patient otherwise generally well [D-16, P-16, D-39]; Generated partially covers assessment but omits 'generally well'. Gold details COVID test (swab), self-isolation (with extensions), timeline, possible additional tests [D-40], consult with supervising physician [D-40], more questions [D-40], reassurance [D-41]. Generated correctly covers test/method/timeline/self-care but completely misses additional tests, more questions, reassurance, and incorrectly states no explicit mention of consulting supervising physician despite [D-40] 'we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today', creating a significant factual contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: assessment (partial, misses 'generally well'), COVID test + swab + timeline (full), self-isolation instructions incl. extensions (full). Missed: patient generally well [D-16], possible additional tests [D-40], consult supervising physician [D-40], more questions [D-40], reassurance [D-41]. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: symptoms/assessment/test/swab/timeline/isolation all from [D-39] and earlier transcript. Citations accurate. However, claim 'transcript segments do not explicitly mention plan to consult supervising physician' is false/hallucinated as [D-40] explicitly states 'we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today'; this introduces unverifiable denial and contradicts transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around assessment, tests (method), self-care, timeline, and consult plan per question; no off-topic content, perfectly focused despite misses/errors."
