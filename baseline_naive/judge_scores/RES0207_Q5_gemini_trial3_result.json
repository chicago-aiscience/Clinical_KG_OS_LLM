  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the medication-related risk (missed dose of Keppra). However, it contains a significant factual error by stating that there is no information regarding hereditary risk factors or family history. The transcript explicitly states at [P-26] that epilepsy 'runs in the family' and the patient's mother had it.",
    "completeness": "The answer only covers about 50% of the required information. It addresses the medication risk factor but completely misses the hereditary and family history components, which were specifically requested in the prompt and present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a false claim about the source text, stating that 'no information is available' regarding family history. This is a negative hallucination, as the information is clearly present in the provided transcript at [P-26].",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it addresses the medication portion of the prompt. However, by incorrectly claiming the other half of the prompt cannot be answered due to lack of data, it fails to provide a relevant response for the hereditary/family history component."
