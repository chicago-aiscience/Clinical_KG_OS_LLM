  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the timeline: cough starting Wednesday night (matches Gold [P-1]), worsening slightly on Thursday and further on Friday (Gold [P-1]), fatigue emerging Thursday ('really tired' [P-1]), fever first on Friday (over 100°F [P-1,P-2]), and decreased appetite Friday ([P-15,P-17]). No factual contradictions; minor omissions like runny nose or P-12 summary do not introduce errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers all core key points: Wednesday cough onset, Thursday cough worsening + fatigue, Friday cough worsening + fever + decreased appetite. Misses minor details like runny nose [P-16], 'significant fatigue' [P-25], dry cough quality, P-12 summary, and P-4 correction (covers ~85-90% of Gold's specifics).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Wednesday/Thursday details [P-1], Friday fever [P-1,P-2], appetite [P-15,P-17]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated content; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured day-by-day response addressing exact question elements (cough onset/severity changes, fever/other symptoms timing) with no off-topic content."
