  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: the doctor said asthma would have been added to the differential if the child had cough/SOB without fever, and the presence of fever led the doctor to prioritize infection and not pursue asthma now (D-45; fever noted by parent P-1/P-2). Generated answer instead names “another viral illness” and frames exclusion based on temperature not being “really high” and absence of neurologic symptoms (D-44), which does not answer the asked differential-diagnosis conditional statement and contradicts the doctor’s explicit statement about asthma in D-45. Therefore the generated answer is largely incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Key points required: (1) condition that would be added if presentation different = asthma; (2) different presentation = cough/SOB without fever; (3) specific finding excluding it from current workup = fever (acute febrile illness suggesting infection). Generated answer includes none of these core points, so coverage is <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "The transcript does mention “another viral illness” and ER precautions for high fever/neurologic symptoms in D-44, so those elements are grounded. However, the generated answer invents an ‘exclusion’ logic (i.e., that a viral illness/serious condition was ruled out because the fever was not “really high”) that is not stated in the transcript; the clinician in fact suggests viral illness as a possibility. It also ignores the explicit asthma discussion in D-45. Multiple claims are misframed or unsupported, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to address a condition and a clinical finding, but it focuses on COVID/other viral illness and ER red flags rather than the doctor’s stated alternative differential (asthma) and the key excluding finding (fever). Thus it is only weakly aligned with the question."
