{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with both the transcript and the Gold Answer. It accurately identifies the diagnostic test, the 14-day isolation period, the condition for contact tracing, and the categories of supportive care. The use of 'analgesics' instead of the transcript's 'anseads' (NSAIDs) is medically acceptable though less specific.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers almost all key points. However, it misses the specific timeframe for the test results (24 to 48 hours) mentioned in the Gold Answer. It also omits the mention of an 'alternative diagnosis' (other viral illness) which the Gold Answer included as part of the management context, though it was not explicitly requested in the prompt's list of specific items.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript segment [D-52]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and specifically addresses all four components requested in the question: diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care recommendations."
