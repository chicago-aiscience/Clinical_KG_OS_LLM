  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core respiratory symptoms (increased cough frequency, increased green-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, worsened dyspnea) and most systemic symptoms (possible fever, sinus pressure) from the Gold Answer, with correct citations. It correctly identifies cough as most bothersome. Minor discrepancies include omitting reduced exercise tolerance [P-4] and mild headache [P-14], and incorrectly listing chronic high blood pressure [P-22] as an acute systemic symptom of the 3-day worsening, which is a pre-existing condition not reported as worsening acutely.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered from Gold: increased cough [P-1], increased green-yellow sputum [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], worsened dyspnea [P-1], possible fever [P-9/P-10/P-11], sinus pressure [P-12], cough most bothersome [P-12]. Missed: reduced exercise tolerance (walks trickier [P-4]), mild headache [P-14]. Extraneous: high blood pressure (chronic, not acute). Covers approximately 80-90% of Gold's key positive symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1] for respiratory symptoms, [P-9] for fever, [P-12] for cough/sinus). No hallucinations; high blood pressure is present in transcript [P-22] though miscategorized.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response to match question by categorizing respiratory and systemic symptoms during the acute worsening and specifying the most bothersome symptom; minor tangent with high blood pressure but no off-topic content."
