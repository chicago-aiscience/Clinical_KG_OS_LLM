  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the persistent two-week cough transitioning from productive (mucus) to dry, resolved flu symptoms, and chest discomfort with coughing, matching Gold's core facts on cough evolution and chest soreness. However, it inaccurately lists chronic acid reflux as a current symptom of the two-week illness (it's a background condition per [P-22], not part of acute symptoms), vaguely covers 'flu symptoms' without specifying sore throat or runny nose as Gold does, characterizes chest issue as 'Chest Pain' without Gold's nuance of soreness only post-coughing and denial of independent pain, and omits cough details like frequency, stability, and triggers. Pertinent negatives are missed but not contradicted. Overall, some factual errors but main points (cough persistence and early resolution of others) correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: persistent cough (2wks), resolved sore throat (2-3d), runny nose (couple days), whitish-clear mucus (4-5d), flu symptoms resolved (3-4d except cough), persisting dry cough (~d4-5), cough frequency (3-4x/hr), spontaneous/no triggers, stable intensity/frequency, chest soreness w/excess coughing (no indep pain), negatives (no SOB, fever, N/V, abd pain). Generated covers: cough 2wks/basic dry transition, resolved mucus/flu symptoms vaguely, chest pain w/coughing. Misses: sore throat/runny specifics, mucus color/timing precision, all persisting cough details (freq/intensity/triggers), soreness nuance/denials, negatives. Adds irrelevant acid reflux. Covers ~30-40% (broad cough/early symptoms, partial chest), score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: cough/dry/mucus [P-2,P-5,P-6], chest [P-15], flu [P-14], acid reflux [P-22]. No fabrications or inaccurate citations; minor overlap in mucus description but grounded. Fully faithful.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around present vs resolved symptoms for the two-week illness, perfectly mirroring question format with bullet points. Minor irrelevance in including chronic acid reflux as a 'symptom present,' but no major tangents or off-topic content."
