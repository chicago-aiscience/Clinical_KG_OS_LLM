  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript, including diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID-19 swab), physical exam (chest-focused), self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate as much as possible, from the doctor), timeline (24-48 hours), and disposition criteria (based on test results, no specific thresholds). Minor discrepancy: adds 'According to the knowledge graph...' which is not in Gold or transcript, but does not contradict core facts.",
    "completeness": "Covers 100% of Gold Answer key points: management plan overview, physical exam details and purpose, both diagnostic tests with purposes, exact self-isolation quotes and source (doctor), timeline with nurse follow-up if positive, disposition based on results (no thresholds noted). Structures response to match question categories perfectly.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims are directly verifiable in [D-37] with accurate citations and quotes (minor quote fixes like [an] infection are faithful to transcript intent). The 'knowledge graph' reference and explanatory purpose '(covid)' are minor unverifiable additions/hallucinations not in transcript, but do not fabricate core content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response into exact categories requested (tests, phys exam, self-isolation with source, timeline, criteria), with no off-topic content."
