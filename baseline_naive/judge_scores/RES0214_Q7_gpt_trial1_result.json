  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient’s first symptom as a stuffy nose and notes fever for the past three days and an ongoing sore throat, which match the Gold Answer. However, it contains a major factual error regarding the husband’s timeline: the transcript explicitly states the husband has had similar symptoms \"for the past week\" [P-19], whereas the Generated Answer claims the duration/timeline is not provided and implies concurrence. It also inaccurately frames muscle aches as occurring \"following\" fever, while the transcript supports that aches began over the past 2–3 days and overlap with the fever period [P-14–P-16]. Given the incorrect/contradictory husband timeline (central to the question), correctness is significantly reduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) stuffy nose first, (2) sore throat present and ongoing, (3) fever present x3 days, (4) muscle aches mentioned. Key elements missed or inadequately addressed: (a) explicit husband symptom duration of ~1 week [P-19], (b) comparison that husband started several days earlier than the patient, (c) muscle aches temporally overlapping with fever (2–3 days) rather than clearly after, and (d) the staggered onset pattern emphasized in the Gold Answer. Because the question specifically asks for comparison to the husband’s onset, this omission is substantial.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements about the patient’s own symptom sequence are grounded in [P-1] and [P-13]. However, the claim that the husband’s duration/timeline is not provided is directly contradicted by [P-19]. The implication that the husband’s illness is simply concurrent is also not supported (the transcript indicates a longer duration for him). The muscle-ache timing is presented as sequential (“following the onset of fever”), which is not clearly supported and conflicts with the documented overlap. These issues represent multiple unfaithful claims.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on symptom chronology and includes a section comparing to the husband, which is relevant. However, the comparison component is incorrect and incomplete, limiting how well it addresses the question’s intent."
