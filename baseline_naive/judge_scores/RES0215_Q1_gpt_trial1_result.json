  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key respiratory symptoms described in the transcript: wheeze (P-1, P-2), shortness of breath (P-1), slight cough (P-1), difficulty taking deep breaths (P-2), getting out of breath with activity (P-3), and having a hard time catching her breath without cyanosis (P-32). However, it states the earliest symptom was only wheeze; the transcript indicates the earliest symptoms were BOTH wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths (P-2). This is an omission rather than a direct contradiction.",
    "completeness": "It includes most symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer (wheeze, SOB, cough, exertional out-of-breath, hard time catching breath, difficulty deep breaths). But it does not fully answer the timeline part: it fails to name difficulty taking deep breaths as an earliest symptom (P-2) and does not clearly separate which symptoms were present at presentation (wheeze/SOB/cough) versus those characterizing episodes. It also omits the non-productive cough detail (no phlegm, P-31), which the Gold Answer includes.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all clinical claims are supported by cited transcript lines. The reference to a \"knowledge graph\" and its associations is not present in the transcript and is therefore an ungrounded addition, though it does not materially alter the clinical content.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked items (respiratory symptoms and which appeared earliest). Minor irrelevant/meta content (\"clinical documentation and the knowledge graph\") slightly detracts but does not overwhelm the core answer."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and grounded identification of symptoms, but incomplete on the onset timeline (misses that difficulty taking deep breaths was also an earliest symptom) and adds a small ungrounded \"knowledge graph\" reference."
