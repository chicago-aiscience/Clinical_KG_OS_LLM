  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several major factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify which symptom appeared first, whereas [P-3] explicitly states 'It felt pretty stuffy at first.' It also claims there was no shift in predominance, contradicting [P-3] where the patient says it is 'mostly running' now. Furthermore, it incorrectly identifies the symptoms as intermittent, ignoring the patient's clarification in [P-8] that the symptoms have been 'pretty constant.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the key chronological transitions described in the Gold Answer. It misses the shift from congestion to rhinorrhea and the crucial clarification regarding the constancy of symptoms versus the initial 'on and off' description. It also fails to mention the potential role of decongestants.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript is ambiguous about symptom order. It also misattributes a quote: it claims [P-15] describes the discharge as 'a little bit,' but in the transcript, [P-15] is the patient's response to a question about fatigue. It disregards the explicit correction in [P-8] regarding the constant nature of the symptoms.",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer attempts to address all parts of the question (onset, order, predominance, and frequency), the information provided is largely inaccurate based on the source text."
