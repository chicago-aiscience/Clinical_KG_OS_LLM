  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies 'cardiac ischemic pictures' as the condition placed lower on the differential. It accurately reflects the doctor's reasoning from turn D-36, noting the distinction between chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as the absence of chest pain.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary evidence cited by the doctor in the concluding summary (D-36). However, the Gold Answer includes additional 'pertinent negatives' that the doctor screened for earlier in the transcript (anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom), which were not included in the generated response.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript. The distinction between tightness and pain [P-5] and the doctor's observation regarding exertional dyspnea [D-36] are correctly cited.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's requirements regarding the condition, the nature of the complaints, and the absence of symptoms."
