  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer’s stated management: COVID swab testing with results in 24–48 hours, isolation for 14 days, and specific isolation from the younger sister. It also correctly includes the ER/return precautions (high temperature, neurologic symptoms such as seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting), which are in both the transcript and Gold Answer. No incorrect or contradictory statements are introduced.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core elements asked and included in the Gold Answer (COVID swab, 24–48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation, isolate from younger sister, ER precautions). However, compared to the full Gold Answer, it omits: (1) the doctor’s discussion of possible false-negative results, (2) that a negative test could still mean another viral illness, (3) that no medications were prescribed and the plan was supportive/observational while awaiting results, and (4) the school’s requirement for a COVID test to return. Thus it is not fully complete relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included recommendations (COVID swab, 24–48 hours, 14-day isolation, isolate from younger sister, ER precautions) are directly supported by the transcript (primarily D-44). No clear hallucinations or unsupported details are present.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on management measures—diagnostic test, isolation instructions/duration, and the specific household member to isolate from—and adds relevant safety-net/ER precautions. No irrelevant tangents."
