  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the triad of symptoms (worsening cough, fever ~100-101°F, possible loss of taste) matching the Gold Answer's core facts and links them to COVID alignment in [D-44]. However, it has factual errors: refers to 'father' (transcript indicates mother), inaccurate citations (P-15 unrelated to cough worsening; Gold uses P-1/P-5/P-12), omits dry cough quality and 3-day timeline specifics, attributes infectious conclusion mainly to [D-44] without Gold's emphasis on fever distinguishing infection from asthma in [D-45], and some main point remains correct despite discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: triad of symptoms (cough, fever, taste change) with citations (partial match), [D-44] alignment to COVID. Missed: precise dry cough worsening over 3 days details/citations, explicit [D-45] fever role in ruling out asthma for infectious process, acute onset/systemic symptoms (fatigue, decreased appetite), prioritization of viral over non-infectious. Covers ~60-70% of keys.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: symptoms from P-1/P-2/P-17, [D-44] quote (minor 'allowed' transcription), swab/isolation. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'medical knowledge graph provided' (absent), 'father' (mother in transcript), P-15 citation (appetite/swallowing, not cough), implies shortness of breath in context but not central. Multiple inaccuracies/hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by breaking down exact symptom triad and doctor's use for COVID alignment/infectious conclusion; minor extras (swab/isolation) are directly tied to doctor's response, no off-topic content."
