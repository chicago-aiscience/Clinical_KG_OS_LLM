  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states the pain is “very sharp, strong” and associated with deep breaths (matches P-3), and that episodes last ~20 minutes (matches P-6). It also correctly lists common contexts when the patient notices it (studying, walking to school; matches P-4). However, it adds an unsupported inference that “physical exertion may be a trigger” based on the patient being “nervous to run” (P-28). In the transcript, the patient explicitly says it does not worsen with exercise and walking stays the same (P-10), and the running comment reflects anxiety rather than a trigger. This is a factual/interpretive error, though not overwhelming.",
    "completeness": "Gold answer key points include: (1) discomfort/odd feeling for ~1.5 weeks; (2) sharp/strong pleuritic quality with deep breath; (3) intermittent episodes ‘here and there’ several times/day; (4) ~20-minute duration; (5) occurs when alone (walking alone, studying alone) and can occur at rest; (6) tends to resolve/go unnoticed when distracted/with others/at school/working hands-on; (7) not worse with exercise; (8) no injury; (9) no prior similar pain. Generated answer covers (2), (4), and part of (5) (studying/walking). It misses the “resolve/go unnoticed when engaged with others” contrast asked in the question, and omits most other contextual and temporal details (intermittent pattern, 1.5-week course, rest vs exercise, etc.).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (sharp/strong with deep breath; ~20 min; studying/walking). The statement suggesting exertion may be a trigger is not supported and conflicts with P-10; it is speculative rather than transcript-grounded. Otherwise no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (quality, duration, situations when it occurs). However, it does not address the ‘versus resolve’ part (when it goes away/goes unnoticed), which is central to the question, and includes a minor tangent/speculation about exertion."

  "summary": "Accurately captures the pain’s sharp pleuritic quality, ~20-minute episodes, and that it occurs during studying/walking, but is incomplete on when it resolves/goes unnoticed and adds an unsupported exertion-trigger inference."
