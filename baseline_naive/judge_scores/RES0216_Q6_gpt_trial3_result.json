  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the clinician’s leading assessment as recurrent asthma and accurately describes the plan to perform a physical exam with lung auscultation and to try a rescue inhaler as a therapeutic trial, with reassessment if ineffective. A minor issue is potential internal inconsistency around rescue inhaler availability: the transcript indicates the patient does not currently have an as-needed/rescue inhaler (P-17–P-18), whereas the generated answer notes the patient ‘confirms they take salbutamol’ (P-25). While P-25 does state salbutamol, the key point in the plan is that the patient needs rescue puffers available/renewed; the answer does not clearly state this renewal need. No major contradictions otherwise.",
    "completeness": "Covers the main gold points: (1) asthma recurrence as top differential, (2) planned quick exam with listening to lungs, (3) first-step trial of rescue puffers, (4) contingency to reassess and consider other directions if no improvement. Missing/underemphasized elements from the gold answer include: explicit mention of considering further investigations depending on exam findings, the explicit ‘one thing at a time’ stepwise framing, and the note that the clinician will go discuss with/consult the supervising doctor before returning.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in D-35/D-36. However, the inclusion of ‘knowledge graph’ justification and citation ([KG]) is not present in the transcript and is therefore an unverifiable/hallucinated element. Aside from that, the remaining content is supported by the transcript (including the ‘come back to the table’ language).",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question: overall assessment, planned physical exam component(s), first-step intervention, and the contingency plan if the initial step fails. Minimal extraneous content aside from the ‘knowledge graph’ aside."
