    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states 'The transcript does not contain any information regarding a specific medication the patient had tried prior to the visit,' when in fact the patient explicitly states 'I've tried like decongestants' in [P-10]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies this medication and the patient's assessment ('worked a little bit'). The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol Cold as the recommended OTC treatment but misses important details about supportive care (hydration) and timeline expectations. The claim that the patient only assessed their condition as 'not getting any better' is misleading since this was stated before they tried decongestants, and they later provided a more nuanced assessment in [P-10].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 30-40% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies Tylenol Cold but completely misses: (1) the decongestant medication tried before the visit, (2) the patient's actual assessment of the decongestant's effectiveness ('worked a little bit'), (3) the reasoning behind the assessment (stuffy to runny transition), (4) staying well hydrated as part of supportive care, (5) the timeline of 'a few weeks' for resolution, and (6) the acknowledgment that there's not much beyond supportive care for viral infection. It only partially addresses 1 of 3 main question components.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination or misrepresentation. It claims no medication information exists in the transcript when [P-10] clearly states 'I've tried like decongestants.' The statement about the patient's assessment is partially grounded but misleadingly attributes [P-1] comments (made before discussing medication) as the assessment of medication effectiveness. The Tylenol Cold recommendation is accurately cited from [D-39]. Overall, there's a significant failure to accurately represent information present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address all three parts of the question (prior medication, effectiveness assessment, recommended treatment) but does so incompletely and inaccurately. It directly engages with the question structure but provides incorrect or incomplete information for 2 of the 3 components. The response is formatted appropriately and stays on topic, but the substance is deficient."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer has significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. Most critically, it incorrectly claims no medication information exists in the transcript when the patient explicitly mentions trying decongestants in [P-10]. It misrepresents the patient's assessment of effectiveness by citing comments made before medication use rather than the actual assessment given in [P-10]. While it correctly identifies Tylenol Cold as the recommended treatment, it omits important details about hydration, timeline expectations, and the rationale for supportive care only. The answer covers less than half of the key points from the Gold Answer and contains factual errors that would be clinically significant."
