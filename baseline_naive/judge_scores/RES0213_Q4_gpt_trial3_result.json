  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly contains multiple doctor turns labeled [D-1] through [D-33] with explicit screening questions (e.g., accidents/injuries [D-5], exertional worsening [D-10], fevers/sickness [D-12], asthma history [D-23–D-24], dyspnea [D-19], family sudden death/swimming [D-31], arrhythmias [D-32]). The Generated Answer’s central claim—that there is no doctor dialogue and therefore the question cannot be answered—directly contradicts the provided transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer lists six ruled-out/screened conditions and the specific questions used to exclude each. The Generated Answer provides none of these conditions or question lines, and instead refuses to answer. Therefore it misses essentially 100% of required key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not grounded in the transcript. It hallucinates a major structural fact: that the transcript consists exclusively of patient turns and contains no doctor dialogue. This is demonstrably false from the provided source transcript, making the response largely unfaithful to the evidence.",
    "relevance": "The response does not address the user’s request to identify conditions screened for and the corresponding exclusion questions. It instead argues the task is impossible. While it is tangentially related (it comments on ability to answer), it fails to provide the requested clinical content."
