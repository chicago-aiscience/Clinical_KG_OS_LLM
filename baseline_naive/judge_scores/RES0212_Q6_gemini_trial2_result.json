  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect in its premise. It claims that the doctor's dialogue is missing from the transcript, whereas the source text clearly includes segments [D-1] through [D-48]. Consequently, it fails to identify the doctor's plan and assessment which are explicitly stated in [D-47].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 100% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not provide the doctor's plan (reviewing with other doctors), the summary assessment (3-month cough, greenish sputum, no constitutional symptoms), or the guiding information for next steps (supervising physician's review).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a major hallucination by claiming the transcript is incomplete and only contains patient lines up to [P-23]. This contradicts the provided source material which contains the full consultation. It also misidentifies the cough duration as one month instead of the three months mentioned in the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer fails to address any part of the question. Instead of answering the prompt, it provides an incorrect meta-commentary on the source text's completeness and a brief, partially inaccurate summary of patient symptoms."
