  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct based on the transcript and matches the gold answer for the items it includes (shortness of breath, seizure, and the fever value 37.4). There are no contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer. Specifically, it fails to mention the 'cough' (which the gold answer identifies as a second respiratory symptom), the characterization of the cough (dry, no sputum), the timing/duration (3 hours ago), and the units for the fever (Celsius). It also omits the pertinent negatives mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-8, P-5].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question. It does not include any unnecessary information."
