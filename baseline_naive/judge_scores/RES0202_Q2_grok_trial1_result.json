  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all stated facts from the Gold Answer and transcript without any errors or contradictions. It correctly identifies the COVID swab test, 14-day isolation (noting test results in 24-48 hours), isolation from the younger sister, and ER criteria (high temperature, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells), all matching [D-44]. No factual inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation specifically from younger sister, ER precautions for high temp/neurological symptoms. Missed: explicit household composition (parents and sister from [P-35]), mention of false negatives/another viral illness, no medications/supportive care/wait for results, mother's acknowledgment ([P-41]), school requirement ([P-41]). Covers core management measures (approx. 80%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-44]: COVID swab, results 24-48 hours, 14-day isolation including from younger sister ('isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible'), ER signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weak/dizzy, fainting). Citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around diagnostic test, isolation instructions/duration, specific household member (younger sister) to isolate from, and additional relevant management (ER criteria). No off-topic content; highly focused."
