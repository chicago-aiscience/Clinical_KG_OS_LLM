  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states that the cough began about two weeks prior and persisted throughout (matches [P-2]). It also correctly notes that other flu-like symptoms resolved within ~3–4 days (matches [P-14]) and that cough-related chest discomfort can occur after coughing a lot (matches [P-15–P-16]).\n\nHowever, it contains a major timeline error: it implies the productive-to-dry transition happened after 2–3 days, whereas the transcript specifies mucus production for the first 4–5 days before becoming dry ([P-6]). It also inaccurately characterizes the cough as “now frequent and intense,” despite the patient stating intensity stayed “kind of the same” ([P-7]) and frequency did not increase ([P-8]). It omits the mucus description (“whitish clear”) and does not report absence of fever, stable frequency estimate, or spontaneity/triggers, all of which are part of the requested timeline details.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: cough onset (~2 weeks), persistence, other symptoms resolving by day 3–4, presence of cough-related chest soreness.\n\nKey elements missed or incorrect: (1) mucus duration (4–5 days) and appearance (whitish clear), (2) correct timing of transition to dry cough (after day 4–5), (3) sore throat timeline (first 2–3 days) and runny nose presence, (4) cough intensity staying the same over two weeks, (5) cough frequency staying stable and estimated 3–4 times/hour, (6) spontaneous/no triggers, (7) no fevers, (8) COVID test negative at onset and staying home (included in Gold). Overall, it captures less than half of the requested timeline specifics and misses several required components.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not supported or contradict the transcript: the answer places the productive-to-dry transition after 2–3 days (contradicts [P-6] which states 4–5 days), and suggests the cough is currently “frequent and intense,” whereas the patient reports unchanged intensity and no increase in frequency ([P-7], [P-8]). Other included points are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on symptom progression over the two-week period and does not introduce unrelated content. However, it does not fully answer the question’s specific requested details (mucus characteristics/duration, cough frequency/intensity changes, etc.)."
