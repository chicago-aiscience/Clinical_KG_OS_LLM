  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline elements (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertainty of attachment, >72 hours estimate [P-1, D-6]) and prior episode (bullseye rash, antibiotics, swollen tick ~10 years ago [P-3]). Minor discrepancies include omitting hope it was from hiking not gardening, specific discovery due to soreness 'earlier today,' exact knee crease location, and doctor's confirmation of non-engorged tick [D-4]; it slightly misattributes 'little bit swollen' to the site rather than primarily the tick, but core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers key timeline points: hiking Fri/gardening Sat [P-1], brought tick in container [P-1], uncertain timing/>72h [P-1,D-6]; comparison: prior rash/abx/swollen tick [P-3], current local red/tender/sore [P-1,P-3], less engorged tick [P-3]. Misses: hoped from hiking [P-1], soreness-prompted discovery 'earlier today' [P-1], embedded/stuck [P-1], current no larger rash [P-6], current tick 'pretty small' explicitly [P-4], doctor's grape analogy [D-4] (~80-90% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: timeline from [P-1,D-6], symptoms/location [P-1], prior/current contrasts [P-3]; no fabrications, minor interpretive phrasing (e.g., 'site ... little bit swollen') grounded in patient's descriptions of soreness and lesser engorgement.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response into timeline and comparison sections addressing the exact question elements (exposure unfolding Fri-Sat-discovery-presentation, symptom/engorgement contrasts to prior), with no off-topic content."
