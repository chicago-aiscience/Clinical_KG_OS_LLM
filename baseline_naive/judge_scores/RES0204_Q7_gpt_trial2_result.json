  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely inaccurate compared with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not provide the chronological order of onset, duration of symptoms, change in cough severity, or comparison to prior similar episodes. In fact, the transcript clearly states: cough duration 4–5 days (P-2, P-4), runny nose for the past couple of days (P-11), cough stayed the same (P-7), and prior history noting never having a dry cough like this and prior runny noses not lasting this long (P-24). The only correct elements are that the cough was identified as dry (D-5/P-5), runny nose was discussed, and chest X-ray/COVID swab were proposed (D-37, D-39).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) cough described as dry. \nKey points missed: (1) cough started 4–5 days before visit; (2) cough was non-productive throughout; (3) cough severity stable/not improving; (4) runny nose started later and lasted only a couple of days (relative timing vs cough); (5) clear nasal discharge; (6) comparison to prior history (never had dry cough like this; runny noses never lasted this long); (7) contextual note that this was novel for patient and no SOB/wheeze history per mother. Overall coverage is far below 20%.",
    "faithfulness": "While the answer does not invent new clinical facts, it repeatedly claims that information is absent when it is explicitly present in the transcript (duration, timing sequence, stability of cough, prior-experience comparison). These are multiple contradictions of the source, reducing faithfulness. The cited X-ray/COVID swab proposals are faithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured around the asked elements (timing, duration, severity change, comparison), but it largely fails to answer them by incorrectly asserting the transcript lacks the relevant details. It also adds some minor tangential context (X-ray/COVID swab) not required by the question."
