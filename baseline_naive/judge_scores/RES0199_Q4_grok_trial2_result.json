  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately states the condition as 'covid' (matching Gold's 'COVID-19'), test as 'swab', turnaround time as '24 to 48 hours', and alternative diagnosis as 'another viral illness', with no factual errors or contradictions compared to Gold Answer and directly supported by [D-52].",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: condition to rule out (COVID/covid), diagnostic test (swab), expected turnaround time (24-48 hours), alternative diagnosis if negative (another viral illness). Misses additional details in Gold like isolation for 14 days, contact tracing if positive, and supportive management, but these are not core to the question's key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript (e.g., 'rule out covid', 'take a swab', '24 to 48 hours', 'another viral illness'); accurate citation; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer uses bullet points to precisely address each part of the question (condition, test, turnaround time, alternative diagnosis) with no off-topic content."
