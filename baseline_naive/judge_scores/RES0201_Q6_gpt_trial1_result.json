  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the clinician’s stated assessment that the patient’s symptoms are consistent with common COVID-19 symptoms and the planned management steps: COVID swab testing and a chest X-ray, plus isolation guidance. It correctly states the key isolation condition: isolation until results return, and continued isolation if symptoms persist even with a negative test. No statements contradict the Gold Answer. The only minor issue is that it attributes specific symptoms (e.g., difficulty swallowing, muscle aches, fatigue) as the features aligning with COVID-19, whereas the transcript does not explicitly list which symptoms prompted that conclusion—only that “some” symptoms do [D-43].",
    "completeness": "Covers the Gold Answer’s key required elements: (1) overall assessment (COVID-19 symptom alignment), (2) both diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), (3) isolate until test result, and (4) continue isolating if still symptomatic despite a negative result. It omits the contextual plan detail noted in the Gold Answer that the clinician would review with/speak to the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps [D-1, D-44], which is part of the broader management plan but not central to the question’s specified elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by [D-43]. The isolation instructions and both diagnostic tests are explicitly stated. The only mildly unverifiable detail is specifying which exact symptoms “align with common symptoms of COVID-19,” since the transcript does not enumerate them at that point—though those symptoms are present elsewhere in the transcript and the clinician did say “some of your symptoms” are consistent with COVID-19 [D-43].",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by summarizing assessment, listing diagnostic tests, giving isolation instructions, and specifying the condition requiring ongoing isolation after results. No meaningful tangents."
