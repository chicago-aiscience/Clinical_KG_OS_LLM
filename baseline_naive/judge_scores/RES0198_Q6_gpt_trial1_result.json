{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s end-of-visit plan: working diagnosis of viral URI/common cold with COVID considered due to symptom overlap; supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold); COVID swab ordered with results in ~48 hours; isolate at home and await public health instructions. No statements contradict the Gold Answer; additions (e.g., “rule in or out COVID”) are consistent with ordering a COVID swab.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core elements requested: diagnosis, both specific supportive-care recommendations (hydration, Tylenol Cold), the diagnostic COVID swab ordered today, and public health guidance (isolate at home, avoid others, await results, further instructions from public health). Misses one management-plan expectation explicitly stated in the Gold Answer/transcript: symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve and that there isn’t much beyond supportive care.",
    "faithfulness": "All included elements are directly supported by [D-39]. No hallucinated medications, tests, or guidance. Minor rephrasing (\"rule in or out\") remains grounded in the stated purpose of COVID testing.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question and stays focused on the end-of-visit management plan components."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, well-grounded, and highly relevant, but slightly incomplete because it omits the doctor’s expectation-setting that symptoms may take a few weeks to resolve and that care is mainly supportive."
