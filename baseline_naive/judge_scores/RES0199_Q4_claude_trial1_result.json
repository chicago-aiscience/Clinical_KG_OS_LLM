  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all the key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab test as the diagnostic method, the 24-48 hour turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. All information is factually consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main components required by the question: (1) the condition to rule out (COVID-19), (2) the diagnostic test and turnaround time (swab, 24-48 hours), and (3) the alternative diagnosis (another viral illness). However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the rationale for ruling out COVID-19 ('symptoms overlap'), the 14-day isolation instruction, the public health contact tracing mention, and the supportive management approach. These are supplementary details that add context but are not core requirements of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is fully grounded in the transcript, specifically citing [D-52] as the source. All claims made can be verified in the transcript: the COVID-19 diagnosis, the swab test, the 24-48 hour timeframe, and the alternative viral illness diagnosis are all explicitly stated by the doctor in [D-52]. The answer includes appropriate citation and makes no fabricated claims.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what condition to rule out, what test was ordered with its turnaround time, and what alternative diagnosis was considered. It is focused and contains no irrelevant information. The answer is structured clearly with bullet points that map directly to the question components."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-grounded, and highly relevant response to the clinical question. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, specifies the swab test with its 24-48 hour turnaround time, and notes the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness. The answer is fully faithful to the transcript with appropriate citation. While it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer (isolation instructions, contact tracing, management approach), it comprehensively addresses all core components of the question."
