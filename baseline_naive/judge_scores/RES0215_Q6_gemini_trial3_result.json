  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the absence of a plan. It claims the transcript does not contain the doctor's explicit statement for next steps, whereas [D-58] explicitly outlines a physical exam, consulting a physician, and returning to discuss the plan. It also only identifies one environmental factor (air filters), missing smoking, carpets, pets, and fireplaces.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer. It misses 100% of the stated plan components and approximately 80% of the environmental factors (smoking, pets, carpets, fireplace, housing type).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails to ground its conclusion in the provided text. By stating the information is missing when it is present in the final turn of the doctor ([D-58]), it exhibits a significant failure in information retrieval from the source.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the prompt but provides a 'not found' response for the primary part of the question despite the information being available in the text, making it largely unhelpful for the user's query about the plan and environment factors. It only successfully identifies one minor detail (air filters)."
