  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer aligns with most facts in Gold Answer: correctly identifies productive cough with red spots (though omits 'yellow custard' specificity from P-6), fever and chills (citation to P-5 is acceptable as it mentions fever start, Gold uses P-8 for details), exertional dyspnea (P-10), and pleuritic chest pain worsening with deep breaths/coughing (P-19). Minor discrepancies: describes sputum vaguely as 'gunk' without yellow detail; calls red spots 'hemoptysis' (accurate enough but Gold specifies blood-tinged sputum); inaccurately describes pleuritic pain as 'sharp' while transcript/Gold note 'dull'; omits smoking risk factor and full pain details (constant at rest). Core facts correct, no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: productive cough/red spots (partial, misses yellow sputum P-6); fever (P-8 equiv), chills (P-9); exertional dyspnea (P-10/11); detailed pleuritic pain (partial, covers worsening but misses constant/dull/at rest P-18-21); pleural involvement reasoning. Missed: precise sputum description, full pain baseline details (constant even lying still), smoking history (P-37/38) as predisposing factor. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable: cough [P-1/4], red spots/gunk [P-4/6], fever [P-5/8], chills [P-9], dyspnea [P-10], right pain worsening on inspiration/cough [P-17/19]. Minor issues: fever citation slightly off but present; introduces 'sharp pain' for pleuritic (transcript says 'dull' P-21, typical description but not verbatim); 'objective systemic signs' slightly stretches subjective reports. No multiple hallucinations, mostly grounded with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing specific transcript findings (with citations) supporting LRTI/pneumonia and explaining pleuritic pain's role in localizing to lower tract/pleural involvement. Structured response perfectly focused, no tangents."
