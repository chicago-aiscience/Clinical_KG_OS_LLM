  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies viral infection as the diagnosis and cites clear discharge, symptom duration, and the doctor's statement from D-39. However, it significantly misses critical differentiating evidence explicitly stated in the Gold Answer: (1) absence of fever, cough, sore throat, headache, and other systemic symptoms that rule out bacterial infection; (2) lack of environmental exposures, no known allergies, and no prior episodes that rule out allergic causes; (3) the nephew's daycare exposure as a plausible viral source. These omissions represent substantial factual gaps in the analysis of differential diagnosis evidence.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the key evidentiary points. It addresses clear discharge, one-week duration, and nasal congestion/rhinorrhea. However, it entirely omits: (1) absent features (no cough, fever, chills, sore throat, shortness of breath, headache, post-nasal drip) that argue against bacterial infection; (2) no environmental exposures, no known allergies, and no recent similar episodes that argue against allergic etiology; (3) the daycare exposure context; (4) symptom progression from stuffiness to runny nose. These are major components explicitly detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful to the transcript with accurate citations [P-1], [P-5], [D-39]. However, there are issues: (1) The phrase 'knowledge graph further corroborates this' suggests an external source not present in the transcript, constituting a minor hallucination; (2) The claim about 'chronic nature' is somewhat misleading—one week is acute, not chronic; (3) The interpretation of 'common cold implies absence of severe symptoms' is inference rather than explicitly stated evidence from the transcript. Most claims are verifiable but there are problematic elements.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about evidence for viral versus allergic/bacterial causes. It maintains focus on symptom characteristics (runny/stuffy nose, clear discharge), duration (one week), and diagnostic reasoning. However, it provides limited analysis of the differential diagnosis—barely mentioning why bacterial or allergic causes were ruled out—which is central to the question. The response is relevant but incomplete in addressing the full scope of the question regarding comparative evidence."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the viral diagnosis and cites some supporting evidence (clear discharge, symptom duration, nasal congestion). However, it significantly lacks completeness by omitting crucial differentiating evidence: absent features arguing against bacterial infection (no fever, cough, sore throat, headache), absent exposures/allergies arguing against allergic causes, and exposure context (daycare nephew). The response covers approximately 40-50% of key points from the Gold Answer. Faithfulness is generally adequate with accurate transcript citations, though it contains a reference to a non-existent 'knowledge graph' and some interpretive overreach. Relevance is maintained but the differential diagnosis analysis is shallow, barely explaining why bacterial and allergic causes were ruled out."
