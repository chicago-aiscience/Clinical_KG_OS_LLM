  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms (cough and runny nose) and the nature of the cough (dry/non-productive). However, it fails to state the appearance of the nasal discharge, claiming it was 'being assessed' rather than reporting the patient's specific answer ('pretty clear') found in the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the duration of the cough (4-5 days), the duration of the runny nose (couple of days), the specific appearance of the discharge (clear), the fact that the cough stayed the same in severity, and all pertinent negatives (no sore throat, chest pain, wheezing, or shortness of breath).",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the transcript. The citations [D-5, D-11, D-12] are accurate, although the answer stops short of the patient's response in P-12.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question but fails to provide the specific detail requested regarding the appearance of the nasal discharge, despite that information being available in the source text."
