  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it characterizes it as an 'acute exacerbation,' whereas the Gold Answer more precisely identifies 'exercise-induced bronchoconstriction' and 'atopic predisposition' based on the triggers. The core diagnosis is consistent.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several critical points found in the Gold Answer: 1) The spontaneous resolution of symptoms with rest (a key feature of asthma), 2) The nocturnal symptoms mentioned in P-43 and P-44, and 3) The pertinent negatives (lack of fever, phlegm, etc.) that rule out infectious causes. It covers about 60% of the reasoning provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinations references to a 'Knowledge Graph' and uses [KG] tags for citations. No Knowledge Graph was provided in the source text. While the transcript-based citations are accurate, the inclusion of nonexistent external sources reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the diagnosis and citing specific findings from the transcript as requested."
