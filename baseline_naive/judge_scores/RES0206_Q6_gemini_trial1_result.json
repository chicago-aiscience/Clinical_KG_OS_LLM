  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is perfectly aligned with the clinical facts presented in both the Gold Answer and the transcript. It accurately lists the components of the physical exam, the specific diagnostic test mentioned (COVID swab), the consultation with the attending, and the differential diagnosis of COPD exacerbation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points of the doctor's plan. It includes the physical exam, COVID testing, attending consultation, decision criteria (labs/vitals), and clinical impression. It misses the specific mention of temperature as a vital sign (which the Gold Answer includes by referencing D-11) and the mention of the patient's agreement, but these are minor omissions relative to the core clinical plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely grounded in the transcript, specifically drawing from D-43. It does not introduce any information not present in the text or the Gold Answer.",
    "relevance": "The response directly and exclusively addresses the question about the doctor's comprehensive plan, organizing the information into logical categories that match the prompt's requirements."
