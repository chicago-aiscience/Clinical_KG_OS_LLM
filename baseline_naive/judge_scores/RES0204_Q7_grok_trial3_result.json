  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript lacks information on symptom chronology (cough first for 4-5 days [P-2,P-4], runny nose later for couple days [P-11]), duration, severity changes (stayed the same [P-7]), and prior history (novel dry cough, past runny noses shorter [P-24]), directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript; this represents major factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: cough onset 4-5 days ago first/dry/non-productive/stayed same/not improving; runny nose couple days later/clear; novel vs prior (no prior dry cough, past runny noses shorter). Generated covers 0% of these, instead denying their existence; <20% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims of no chronological order, no durations (contradicts P-2/P-4/P-11), no severity changes (contradicts P-7), no prior comparisons (contradicts P-24) are unverifiable and false; multiple hallucinated absences; citations like [D-1],[D-5] accurate but minor/irrelevant to denials; largely fabricated by omission claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response directly matching question elements (timing, duration, severity, prior comparison) with sections, minor tangent on clinical context (xray/swab); mostly relevant."
