  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer outlines phases including smoking reduction, teenage anxiety, recent academic stress, and chest pain onset, aligning with Gold's main points, but omits key specifics like smoking start at age 18 [P-18], escalation to 10 cigarettes/day over past 2 years [P-18], 8-year anxiety-free period [P-22], father's heart attack timing [P-8,P-30], and precise thesis stress details [P-15,P-16]; relationships are vaguely connected via risk factors and triggers, differing from Gold's stress/anxiety progression.",
    "completeness": "Covers smoking current status and reduction [P-14], teenage anxiety [P-21], recent weeks stress and studying [P-4,P-15,P-16,P-28], chest pain ~1.5 weeks ago [P-2]; misses smoking initiation/escalation timeline, 8-year gap, father's heart attack relation to fear, anxiety recurrence hints [P-22], pain patterns when alone [P-9,P-29] (~60% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like smoking details [P-14], anxiety history [P-21], stress [P-4,P-28], pain description [P-3,P-4,P-6] verifiable in transcript; however, multiple references to non-existent 'knowledge graph' for smoking-CV link [P-8 misattributed], studying-pain causation are hallucinations; some plausible inferences (e.g., stress trigger) but not all directly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Structures timeline and phase relationships directly addressing the question's sequence (smoking -> anxiety -> stress -> pain), with minor tangents like treatments and KG mentions; focused overall."
