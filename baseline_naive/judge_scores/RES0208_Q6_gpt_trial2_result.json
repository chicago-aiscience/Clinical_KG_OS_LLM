  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the ordered tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), the planned chest/physical exam, the 24–48 hour results timeline, the self-isolation instruction to stay away from everyone including the wife, and that admission vs discharge depends on results—all consistent with the Gold Answer. Minor inaccuracy/overreach: it implies the public health nurse would contact the patient if they go home, whereas the transcript specifies the nurse would advise what to do if results are positive (not explicitly tied to discharge). It also states the tests are used to “confirm” COVID, which is not stated in the transcript (the doctor says COVID cannot be ruled out).",
    "completeness": "Covers the key elements from the Gold Answer: (1) physical exam/chest exam planned, (2) diagnostic tests: chest X-ray + COVID swab, (3) self-isolation instructions including distancing from wife, (4) results expected in 24–48 hours, (5) public health nurse guidance if positive (though phrased less precisely), and (6) disposition based on results. It does not explicitly mention the Gold Answer’s clarification that no specific numerical thresholds/criteria were provided (i.e., only that results would guide the decision).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly grounded in [D-37]. However, the mention of a “knowledge graph” and that the procedures are used to confirm a COVID diagnosis is not present in the transcript and introduces an external assertion. The public health nurse statement is slightly re-framed (conditional on going home rather than explicitly on a positive result). Overall, only minor unverifiable embellishments.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing tests, exam plan, isolation instructions (and who provides follow-up instructions), timeline, and admission vs discharge criteria, with no significant tangents (aside from the brief ‘knowledge graph’ sentence)."
