  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: Claritin carried 'just in case' for allergies but not actively taken (matches [P-16, P-25]); Deyo taken for birth control (matches [P-25, P-26]); allergy shots received in some years from allergist (matches [P-16]). No factual errors or contradictions, though it omits some details like Deyo's 'three months' dosing, oral pill confirmation, and shots' weekly winter schedule—these are absences rather than inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Claritin carried not taken for allergies just in case—fully covered; (2) Deyo oral contraceptive pill 'goes for three months'—partially covered (name/indication yes, misses dosing/pill details); (3) no medication allergies—missed; (4) allergy shots some years, once/week in winter—partially covered (some years yes, misses dosing); (5) no EpiPen, seasonal allergies details—missed. Covers ~70% of key points, missing dosing specifics emphasized in question/Gold.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: Claritin [P-16][P-25], Deyo [P-26], shots [P-16]. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by focusing exclusively on current medications/carrying (Claritin, Deyo with indications/status) and past allergist treatments (shots), using structured format with specifics mentioned; no off-topic content."
