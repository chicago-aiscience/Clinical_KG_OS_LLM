  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab as the test, the 24-48 hour turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. These details are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer provides all specific information requested in the prompt (condition, test, turnaround time, alternative diagnosis). However, compared to the Gold Answer, it omits the doctor's instructions regarding 14-day isolation, contact tracing protocols, and the mention of supportive management. It covers the core requirements but lacks the full clinical context provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Every claim in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript at [D-52]. There are no hallucinations or external additions.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the question. It addresses each sub-question directly using a clear, bulleted format without including extraneous information."
