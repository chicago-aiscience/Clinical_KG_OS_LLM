  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect and directly contradicts the provided transcript. It claims there are no documented negative findings for fever, dyspnea, or sore throat, whereas the transcript explicitly records the patient denying fever (P-10), difficulty breathing (P-11), and sore throat (P-13).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to list any of the negative findings requested by the prompt, missing 100% of the key points identified in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of fever, headaches, sore throat, chills, muscle aches, and chest pain.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that information is missing from the transcript. It states that the text does not include the patient's answers regarding the absence of symptoms, which is false as shown in turns P-10 through P-15 and P-22 through P-27.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer fails to address the primary question. Instead of listing the negative findings as requested, it provides a list of positive findings and incorrectly asserts that the requested negative findings do not exist in the source text."
