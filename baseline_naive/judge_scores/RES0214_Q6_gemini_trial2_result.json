  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab and the isolation recommendation. However, it incorrectly states that the doctor concluded the encounter by asking about the flu shot. In the transcript, after the flu shot discussion, the doctor specifies the actual concluding steps: consulting with a supervising physician and returning. It also fails to mention the physical examination mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two of the four key components found in the Gold Answer: the immediate next step of a physical examination [D-52] and the plan to consult the supervising doctor before returning [D-55]. It covers the test and the isolation but omits the clinical workflow steps.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided (swab, isolation, flu shot question) is present in the transcript. No hallucinations were detected, though the chronological placement of the flu shot question as the 'conclusion' is slightly inaccurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's requirements regarding management plan, tests, and next steps, although its coverage of 'next steps' is less thorough than the Gold Answer."
