  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly explains the >72-hour estimate using the Friday hiking and Saturday gardening timeline and cites the doctor’s explicit statement in [D-6]. However, it is incorrect in claiming the transcript contains no information about Strathroy or the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map. The transcript clearly includes both: the patient hiked in “Strathroy along the creek” [P-12], and the doctor references the Ontario Lyme distribution map and concludes Strathroy is “close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point,” supporting antibiotics [D-13]. This is a significant contradiction of the source and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) patient was outdoors Friday/Saturday and noticed tick later; (2) doctor estimated attachment >72 hours and used that to justify prophylactic antibiotics.\nKey points missed: (1) patient explicitly identified Strathroy as the hiking location [P-12]; (2) doctor used the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map and assessed Strathroy as geographically concerning [D-13]; (3) the combination of duration + geographic risk leading to moving forward with antibiotics [D-13]. Overall, it covers roughly the duration rationale but omits (and incorrectly denies) the geographic rationale.",
    "faithfulness": "While the duration-related statements are grounded in [P-1] and [D-6], the answer introduces an unfaithful claim that there is no mention of Strathroy or the Ontario Lyme distribution map in the transcript. This is directly refuted by [P-12] and [D-13]. Thus, it contains a major transcript-contradicting assertion.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the question topic (attachment duration and geographic justification), but it fails to answer the second component by incorrectly asserting the map/Strathroy discussion is absent. This makes it only partially responsive to the full question."
