  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer. It correctly identifies the test, isolation period, and supportive care. It uses the term 'analgesics' instead of the transcript's 'anseads' (NSAIDs), which is a minor lack of specificity but not factually incorrect.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses two details found in the gold answer: the expected 24-48 hour window for test results and the mention of a possible alternative viral illness if the COVID-19 test is negative. It covers approximately 80% of the gold answer's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly grounded in the transcript segment [D-52]. There are no hallucinations or external information added.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the user's question, including the diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care recommendations."
