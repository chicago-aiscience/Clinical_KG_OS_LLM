  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key symptoms supporting URI diagnosis (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, subjective fever) and appropriately notes the absence of sputum production and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, it introduces elements not in the Gold Answer, such as extensive discussion of 'knowledge graph' and 'diagnostic indicators' that aren't mentioned in either the transcript or Gold Answer. The core factual content aligns well with the Gold Answer's clinical reasoning.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: dry cough, scratchy throat, fever, headache, absence of sputum/phlegm, no GI symptoms, and no joint pain. It includes the brother's cold exposure and general malaise. However, it misses the specific timeline emphasis (3-4 days as typical URI progression) and doesn't mention the doctor's summary at D-58. The allergy discussion is present but framed differently than needed.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is largely grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1], [P-7], [P-9], etc. However, it repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' and 'clinical knowledge base' that don't exist in the provided materials, suggesting hallucinated framework. The clinical interpretations themselves are reasonable and traceable to the transcript, but the meta-structure claiming to derive from a 'knowledge graph' is fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses how Jessica's symptoms support URI diagnosis and appropriately discusses symptom presence and absence. The clinical reasoning is relevant throughout. However, the extensive framing around 'knowledge graphs' and 'diagnostic indicators' adds unnecessary meta-commentary that, while related to the diagnostic process, doesn't directly answer the question as straightforwardly as the Gold Answer does."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates strong clinical reasoning and correctly identifies the key symptoms supporting URI diagnosis while appropriately noting relevant negative findings. It covers most essential points from the Gold Answer with accurate transcript citations. However, it loses points for introducing a fabricated 'knowledge graph' framework not present in the source materials (faithfulness issue) and for somewhat verbose structuring that obscures the direct clinical reasoning. The core medical content is sound, but the presentation includes hallucinated meta-elements."
