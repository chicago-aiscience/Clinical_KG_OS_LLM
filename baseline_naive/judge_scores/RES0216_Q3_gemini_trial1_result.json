  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer. It correctly identifies the diagnosis (asthma recurring) and the primary symptoms and history used to reach it. It accurately cites the exclusion of cardiac causes due to lack of pain.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers several key points (history of asthma, exertion-related symptoms, lack of cardiac pain, and the plan for a therapeutic trial). However, it misses two significant components found in the Gold Answer: 1) The clinical feature of the patient limiting/skipping their medication (skipping night doses and lacking a rescue inhaler), which the doctor specifically highlighted as a reason for the recurrence (D-34). 2) The exclusion of new environmental triggers (P-33). Because it misses the 'medication reduction' point, which is a central part of the doctor's 'linking' logic, it is partially complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. The citations provided ([P-1], [P-7], [P-16], [D-35], etc.) are accurate and correspond to the relevant text.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the combination of factors and how the doctor linked them. It stays focused on the clinical reasoning process."
