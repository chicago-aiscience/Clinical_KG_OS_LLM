  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All stated recommendations match the Gold Answer/transcript: COVID swab ordered; results expected in 24–48 hours; advised 14-day isolation; specifically mentioned isolating from the younger sister; and ER return precautions for high temperature, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, or fainting. No contradictory or incorrect statements are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key elements asked in the question and several management items from the Gold Answer (COVID swab + turnaround time, 14-day isolation, isolate from younger sister, ER precautions). However, it omits several additional management points present in the Gold Answer: acknowledgment of possible false-negative COVID swab, possibility of another circulating viral illness if negative, explicitly that no medications were prescribed/supportive observation while awaiting results, and the school requirement for a COVID test to return.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (primarily D-44). No clear hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what was asked (diagnostic test, isolation instructions/duration, and who to isolate from). The added ER precautions are still part of management and remain relevant."
