  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core diagnosis as a viral infection/common cold and notes the COVID overlap, matching the Gold Answer and transcript. Supportive care (hydration, Tylenol Cold) is correct. Diagnostic swab and public health guidance (isolation, 48 hours, public health follow-up) align well. Minor discrepancies include not quoting 'most likely' precisely, omitting 'today' for swab, and not mentioning symptom duration expectations or limited treatment options, but no major factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnosis (viral cold, COVID overlap), supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (swab, 48h results), public health (isolation at home, no contact, further public health instructions). Missed: explicit 'few weeks to resolve', 'not much besides supportive care', and 'swab done today'. Covers ~85-90% of Gold Answer points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims are directly verifiable in [D-39] of the transcript. Citations primarily accurate to [D-39], but includes unexplained [KG] tags after several points, which are not in the transcript (hallucinated citations). Phrasings like 'rule in or out COVID-19' are implied but not verbatim; overall mostly grounded with minor unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured perfectly around the question's required elements (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance), with no off-topic content or tangents."
