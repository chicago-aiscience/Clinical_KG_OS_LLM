  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the clinician assessed for erythema migrans/bullseye rash and that it was absent. It also correctly identifies the proposal to send the tick to a lab for species identification. However, it implicitly treats this as the only diagnostic test, omitting other proposed evaluation steps from the Gold Answer (blood serology/titers; physical exam). No direct factual contradictions are introduced, but the citation to [P-3] is weaker/earlier than the clearest denial in [P-6].",
    "completeness": "Key absent clinical features in the Gold Answer: erythema migrans (covered), joint pain (missed), fever/systemic illness (missed), headaches (missed), “feeling well otherwise” (missed), and no other bites/exposures on self/husband (missed). Proposed diagnostic/evaluation steps in Gold Answer: physical exam (missed), tick ID in lab (covered), bloodwork for titers/serology (missed), consult supervising physician (missed). Overall, it captures only a small subset of required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims made are supported by the transcript: rash inquiry/absence and sending the tick to the lab are explicitly mentioned. It does not fabricate tests or symptoms. Minor issue: it cites [P-3] for current rash absence, whereas the more direct denial occurs in [P-6], but this is still consistent with the transcript. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the question (absent Lyme features assessed; tests proposed). However, it is substantially incomplete and therefore only partially addresses what was asked."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded for the bullseye rash assessment and tick lab ID, but it omits multiple other screened-for absent symptoms and misses proposed blood serology and physical exam, making it notably incomplete."
