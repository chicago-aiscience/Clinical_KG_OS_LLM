  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several major factual errors. It incorrectly identifies the initial onset as one month ago, whereas the patient and Gold Answer state it was three months ago (at a pole dancing class). It also explicitly states that there was no mention of fevers, which directly contradicts the transcript (P-4) where the patient mentions feeling 'hot at night' in the past couple of days. Additionally, it fails to mention that the sputum became green specifically three days ago.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses three out of the four key temporal milestones: the 3-month initial onset, the 3-day duration of the productive cough, and the 2-day duration of the subjective fevers. It only correctly identifies the 1-month duration for sleep disruption.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript. It claims there is no mention of subjective fevers despite a clear statement in [P-4]. It also misinterprets [P-19] and [P-21] as the initial onset of the cough, whereas those segments specifically refer to the duration of the sleep disruption, ignoring the 3-month onset mentioned in [P-2].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it follows the structure of the prompt and attempts to address each point requested, though the information provided is largely incorrect."
