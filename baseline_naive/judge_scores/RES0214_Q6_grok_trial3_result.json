  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID swab as the specific test ordered [D-53] and the self-isolation recommendation for the patient and husband [D-53, D-54], matching the Gold Answer. However, it inaccurately frames the flu shot question [D-53] as the concluding next step and states that the ongoing plan depends on swab results, omitting the physical exam [D-52] and consultation with the supervising doctor [D-55] as the actual stated next steps per the Gold Answer and transcript. This introduces significant discrepancies in the next steps portion.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) COVID-19 swab ordered [covered], (2) self-isolation for patient and husband [covered], (3) physical exam as next step [missed], (4) consult supervising doctor and return [missed], (5) patient agreement [missed, minor]. Covers approximately 50% of key points (test and isolation).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about COVID swab, self-isolation, and 'keep to yourself' are directly verifiable in [D-53, D-54]. Flu shot question is verifiable in [D-53], but presenting it as the 'concluding' next step and inferring 'ongoing plan depends on swab' introduces minor interpretive stretch not explicitly stated as next steps (actual next: exam [D-52], consult [D-55]). No major fabrications; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question's elements (test ordered, precautionary measures for patient/husband, next steps), using bullet points matching the query, with only minor inaccuracy in next steps content keeping it highly focused."
