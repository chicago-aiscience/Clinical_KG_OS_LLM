  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the assessment implying COVID-like symptoms, the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation including sister, false negative possibility, alternative viral illness if negative, and exact warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting spells). No contradictions or errors; minor omission of the asthma differential (not central to the question) does not detract from full consistency.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: assessment (symptoms consistent with COVID), COVID swab & TAT (100%), isolation period incl. sister (100%), false negatives (100%), alternative diagnosis if negative (100%), warning signs with examples (100%). Misses only the peripheral asthma note from [D-45], covering >99% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-44]: swab/24-48h, isolation/14 days/sister, false negatives, another viral illness, warning signs (high temp, neuro/seizures, weak/dizzy, fainting). Citation accurate; no unverifiable or hallucinated content; assessment grounded in doctor's statements.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly focused on the question's elements (assessment/plan, test/TAT, isolation, alt dx/false neg, warning signs/examples); bullet structure directly mirrors query with no tangents or off-topic content."
