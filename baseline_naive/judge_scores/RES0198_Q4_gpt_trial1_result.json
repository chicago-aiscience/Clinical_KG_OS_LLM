  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the rule-out condition, a COVID swab as the ordered test, a 48-hour turnaround time, and the instruction to isolate at home and avoid seeing others. These match the Gold Answer and are supported by the transcript (P-1, D-39). No clinically meaningful incorrect statements were introduced. The mention of a “knowledge graph provided” is extraneous but not a factual clinical error about the case.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) COVID-19 rule-out, (2) swab ordered today, (3) results expected in 48 hours, (4) isolate at home/not see anyone else. Missing element: the additional instruction that once results return the patient will receive “further instructions from public health.” It also did not explicitly note “today,” though the test is correctly described. Overall, it captures most but not all details.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate citations (P-1, D-39). The only ungrounded piece is the meta-phrase “knowledge graph provided,” which is not in the transcript, but it does not affect the clinical content. No hallucinated clinical details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question (condition to rule out, test, turnaround time, and instructions while awaiting results) with no meaningful tangents."
