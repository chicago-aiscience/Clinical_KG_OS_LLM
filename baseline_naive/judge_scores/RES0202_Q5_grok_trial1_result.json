  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the mother's suspicion of school as the source via correct citations [P-1, P-2], correctly states no known sick contacts outside school per [P-38], notes lack of specific school sick contacts (aligning with no known but 'hard to say'), and confirms no school notification per [P-39]. However, it has minor discrepancies by not fully conveying the 'kinda hard to say' nuance for school contacts and omitting Gold's additional points like school test requirement [P-41], no travel [P-40], and no environmental exposures [P-37], which support narrowing to school.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: school central/suspected [P-2/P-1], symptoms post-school [P-1], no outside sick contacts [P-38], no school notification [P-39]; partially covers school contacts ambiguity. Missed: explicit 'kinda hard to say' [P-38], school COVID test requirement for return [P-41], no travel [P-40], no environmental issues [P-37]. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: [P-2] quote accurate, school suspicion from [P-1/P-2], no outside contacts from [P-38], no specific school contacts/school notification from [P-38/P-39]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around school as suspected source, sick contacts (school vs. outside), and school notifications, perfectly matching the question with no tangents."
