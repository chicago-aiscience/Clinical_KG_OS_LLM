  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies dry cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing as classic asthma symptoms matching the Gold Answer and transcript (P-1, P-14, P-15). It notes asthma diagnosis since age 8 (P-2) and bronchodilator relief (P-1), consistent with Gold. However, it omits chest tightness (P-20, explicitly in question and Gold), does not specify the dramatic increase from once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week (P-8), misses wheezing frequency exceeding use (P-17), triggers (P-9, P-11), and lack of infection indicators. No direct contradictions, but minor discrepancies in detail and scope.",
    "completeness": "Covered: dry cough (P-1, P-14), shortness of breath (P-1, P-19 implied), wheezing (P-15), asthma history (P-2), bronchodilator helps and increased use (P-1, P-8 vaguely), timeline (two weeks, P-13). Missed: chest tightness (P-20), exact bronchodilator frequency escalation (P-8), wheezing more frequent than use (P-17), triggers like exercise/cold (P-9, P-11), comprehensive screening for infections/new conditions (P-21 to P-28, key to differentiating from new condition), medication adjustment suggestion (D-43). Covers ~60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: symptoms (P-1, P-14, P-15), bronchodilator use increase and relief (P-1, P-8), history (P-2), two weeks (P-13), family history (P-32). Citations accurate. Minor unverifiable/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph supports' (no such element in transcript), vague baseline frequency ('potentially less frequent' vs specific P-8). No major fabrications; mostly grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by linking specified symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheezing; omits chest tightness) and bronchodilator increase to worsening asthma vs new condition. Includes relevant evidence from transcript. Minor tangents: family history, knowledge graph. Highly focused overall."
