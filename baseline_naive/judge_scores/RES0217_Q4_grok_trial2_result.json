  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the bullseye rash was assessed and found absent, supported by transcript references [D-6] and [P-3], which aligns with Gold Answer's description (though Gold primarily cites [P-6]); it correctly notes the tick lab test proposal [D-6], consistent with Gold. No factual contradictions or errors in stated claims, but limited scope; minor citation nuance as [P-3] precedes [D-6] but still describes current lesion accurately. Core facts match Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: Clinical features absent - bullseye rash, joint pain [D-7/P-7], fever/illness [D-8/P-8], headaches [D-19/P-19-20], feeling well [D-18/P-18], no other bites [P-9]. Tests - physical exam, tick to lab [D-5/6/18], blood serology [D-18], physician consult [D-13/22]. Generated covers only bullseye rash and tick lab test (~20% coverage: 2 out of 10+ points). Misses all other features and tests.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript: bullseye rash inquiry/denial in [D-6]/[P-3] and implicitly [P-6]; tick lab in [D-6] and reiterated [D-18]; prophylactic antibiotics context [D-6]. Citations accurate; no hallucinated facts or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by identifying one clinical feature (bullseye rash) assessed/absent and one diagnostic test (tick lab), using structured format with transcript citations; no irrelevant content or tangents, fully focused on query elements."
