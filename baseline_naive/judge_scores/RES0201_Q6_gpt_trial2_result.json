{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer: it identifies the clinician’s assessment that symptoms are consistent with COVID-19, specifies the two diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), and correctly states the isolation requirements (isolate until results; continue isolating even if negative if still symptomatic). No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "It covers the key elements asked in the question and emphasized in the Gold Answer: overall assessment (COVID-like symptoms), diagnostic tests (COVID swab, chest X-ray), isolation instructions (until results), and the condition for continued isolation after results (persistent symptoms despite a negative test). It does not include the additional contextual plan element noted in the Gold Answer that the clinician would confer with the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps, but that point is ancillary to the question’s required components.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript, especially D-43 (COVID swab, isolation until results, possible continued isolation if still symptomatic even if negative, and chest X-ray). The answer does not introduce extraneous tests, diagnoses, or instructions not present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what was asked: assessment, tests, isolation instructions, and criteria for continued isolation after results. No meaningful tangents."
