  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states onset ~3 days before the visit and that the patient noticed symptoms during a walk/dog-walk context. However, it contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript does not explicitly state whether symptoms improved/worsened/remained static; in fact, the patient explicitly says it is “staying the same” and “pretty steady” (P-2, P-3). It also inaccurately implies symptoms mainly “appear” with walking, whereas the patient reports a baseline tightness that is “kind of always there” and worsens with certain activities (P-9).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) onset ~3 days; (2) first noticed while walking the dog; (3) inspiratory nature/tightness with breathing in; (4) walking worsens symptoms in general. Key points missed: (1) explicit statement that symptoms are staying the same/steady; (2) no specific trigger (“just kind of came on”); (3) baseline constant tightness; (4) other exacerbating situations (getting up out of chair, taking a big breath in); (5) specific functional impact of reducing walks from a couple per day to typically one; (6) no missed work and agreement that day-to-day function largely intact but noticeable limitation.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded in the transcript (onset timing, inspiratory tightness, association with walking). However, there are notable ungrounded/inaccurate elements: reference to a “provided knowledge graph” (not in transcript), the implication that seeking care suggests progression, and the incorrect claim that progression was not explicitly stated. These reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the chest tightness timeline, triggers/exacerbators, and impact on walking. It has minor irrelevant framing (knowledge graph mention) but otherwise addresses the question’s components."
