  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies that the patient had not tried any treatments or medications and accurately lists the doctor's recommendations for a COVID-19 swab and self-isolation instructions.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary points (no prior treatment, COVID test, and isolation instructions). However, it misses a few secondary details present in the Gold Answer: the specific timeframe for results (1-2 days), the patient's confirmation of taking no regular medications, and the doctor's mention of potential further tests and consultation with a supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is faithful to the transcript and uses appropriate citations. It does mention a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not part of the provided text, but the clinical facts themselves are entirely grounded in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question (prior treatments and recommended interventions/instructions) without unnecessary filler."
