  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect. It claims that the transcript contains only patient dialogue ([P-1] through [P-23]) and lacks doctor's responses labeled [D-X]. However, the Source Transcript clearly contains doctor dialogue from [D-1] through [D-48], including the critical closing statement in [D-47] that directly answers all three parts of the question. The Generated Answer contradicts the Gold Answer entirely and misrepresents the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address any of the three required components: (1) the doctor's stated plan to review the story with supervising doctors, (2) the summary assessment of a 3-month cough worsening over 3 days with greenish sputum and no constitutional symptoms, and (3) that next steps would be guided by the supervising physician's assessment. It covers 0% of the Gold Answer's key points, instead incorrectly claiming the information is unavailable.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination by claiming doctor dialogue is absent from the transcript when it clearly exists throughout. The 'Knowledge Graph Assessment' section appears to fabricate a structured analysis not present in the source. While it correctly notes some patient symptoms, the fundamental premise that doctor responses are missing is false and represents fabricated content about the transcript's structure.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. Instead of providing the requested information about the doctor's plan, assessment, and guidance for next steps, it incorrectly claims this information is unavailable. The clinical summary provided is tangential and does not answer what was asked. The response is entirely off-topic regarding the actual question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally flawed, incorrectly claiming that doctor dialogue is absent from the transcript when it clearly exists from [D-1] through [D-48]. This false premise leads to a complete failure to answer any part of the three-part question about the doctor's plan, assessment, and guidance. The answer contradicts the Gold Answer entirely, covers none of its key points, contains hallucinated claims about the transcript's structure, and provides irrelevant tangential information instead of addressing the question. All dimensions receive the lowest score."
