  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main diagnostic reasoning: clear discharge [P-5], symptom type (stuffy/runny nose), duration of one week, and the supportive care approach. However, it omits several key facts from the Gold Answer: (1) absent features like no cough [P-4], no sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills [P-7], no post-nasal drip [P-6]; (2) symptom progression from stuffiness to runny [P-3]; (3) evidence against allergies (no exposure to allergens [P-22], no allergies [P-28], no recent similar episodes [P-9]); (4) evidence against bacterial cause (no fever, no headache [P-14], clear vs colored discharge); (5) daycare exposure source [P-11]. The answer is factually accurate for what it includes but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the Gold Answer's key points. It addresses: clear discharge quality, symptom type (runny/stuffy nose), one-week duration, and supportive care approach. However, it entirely misses the critical 'absent features' that rule out bacterial/other causes (no cough, fever, sore throat, headache, post-nasal drip), the detailed evidence against allergic etiology (no allergen exposure, no known allergies, no prior episodes), the symptom progression pattern, and the potential viral exposure source (nephew in daycare). These omissions significantly reduce completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: stuffy/runny nose [P-1], clear discharge [P-5], one-week duration [P-1, P-2], doctor's viral infection conclusion [D-39], supportive care and swab recommendation [D-39]. No hallucinated facts are present. The answer is well-grounded in the source material, though it could have extracted more information that was present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about evidence supporting viral over allergic/bacterial causes. All four numbered points relate to diagnostic reasoning. However, point 4 about 'Context and Diagnostic Refinement' is somewhat tangential, discussing COVID-19 testing protocol rather than directly explaining why viral vs allergic/bacterial. The core content is highly relevant, with only minor drift in the final point."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate information about the viral infection diagnosis, correctly citing clear discharge, symptom type, and duration. However, it covers only about 40-50% of the key diagnostic evidence from the Gold Answer, missing critical absent features (no fever, cough, colored discharge) that rule out bacterial causes, and the detailed evidence against allergic etiology (no allergen exposure, no allergies, no prior episodes). While fully grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations, the answer's incompleteness significantly limits its clinical value for understanding the full diagnostic reasoning."
