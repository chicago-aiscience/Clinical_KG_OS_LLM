  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine/OTC for seasonal allergies and no prescribed medications, matching Gold. However, it omits explicit statement on no treatments for current respiratory episodes (key Gold point from P-33/P-34) and past infections not requiring antibiotics (P-16). Minor error in referring to 'the patient' (mother speaking of daughter). 'Knowledge graph' reference is inaccurate as no such thing in transcript. Core facts are consistent, minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) No meds/treatments for current wheezing/SOB episodes, resolve on own (P-33/34); 2) Occasional OTC Reactine/antihistamines for seasonal allergies (P-35/36); 3) No prescribed medications (P-36/46/47); 4) Past viral infections no antibiotics (P-16). Covered: 2 and 3 (~50%). Missed: 1 and 4.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on Reactine/OTC for allergies and no prescribed verifiable in P-35/36 (contextual), citations accurate. However, 'knowledge graph' confirming Reactine as OTC is hallucinated/not in transcript. Minor misattribution to 'patient' vs mother. Some unverifiable/hallucinated elements but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists medications/treatments (allergies) and addresses prescribed (none), aligning with question on current respiratory/other conditions and prescribed meds. Implicitly covers no current meds by omission in list, no irrelevant content."
