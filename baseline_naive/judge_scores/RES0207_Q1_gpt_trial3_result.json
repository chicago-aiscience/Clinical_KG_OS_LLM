  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All included statements match the transcript and the Gold Answer: sudden shortness of breath [P-1], seizure the prior night [P-8], and a measured temperature of 37.4 [P-5]. No contradictory or false details are introduced. The only issue is omission (e.g., cough), not factual inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) sudden-onset shortness of breath, (2) seizure last night/epilepsy as neurological issue (partially—epilepsy history not stated), (3) objective fever measurement 37.4. Key points missed: cough as a respiratory symptom and that it was dry/no sputum and began that morning; temperature unit (°C) and that it was measured that morning. Overall coverage is substantial but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate citations; no hallucinated symptoms or measurements were added.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question by listing respiratory and neurological symptoms and the objective fever measurement, without unrelated tangents."
