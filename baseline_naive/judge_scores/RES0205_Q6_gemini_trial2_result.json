  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect regarding the source text. It claims the transcript only contains patient statements ([P-2] through [P-35]), whereas the transcript clearly includes 38 turns by the doctor (D-1 through D-38). Consequently, it fails to provide the doctor's plan, the physical exam components, or the process for next steps.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer missed all key points from the Gold Answer. It did not mention the heart/lung auscultation, the consultation with the supervising physician, or the plan to reconvene with the patient. It instead provided irrelevant details about the patient's diet and COVID-19 test.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a false claim about the transcript itself, stating it consists exclusively of patient statements. This is a direct contradiction of the provided text, which includes a full dialogue between doctor and patient.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address any part of the question. It explicitly states it is not possible to answer the question, despite the information being present in turns [D-1] and [D-37]."
