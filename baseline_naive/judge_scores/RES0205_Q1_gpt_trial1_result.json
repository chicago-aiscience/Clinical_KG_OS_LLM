  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the key ongoing symptom of a 2-week cough that is now dry and notes earlier mucus production. However, it contains notable inaccuracies/overstatements: (1) it labels the chest discomfort as “chest pain” as a persisting symptom, whereas the patient denied chest pain and described only mild soreness after excessive coughing; (2) it includes “acid reflux” as a current symptom in the context of the two-week illness, but in the transcript reflux is a chronic condition unrelated to the acute complaint. These issues make the response only partially accurate overall.",
    "completeness": "Gold answer key items covered: persistent 2-week cough; earlier mucus that resolved; now dry cough; some chest discomfort with coughing (though imprecisely described). Key items missed: sore throat (first 2–3 days, resolved); runny nose (initial, resolved); specific mucus description and duration (whitish/clear, 4–5 days); cough frequency (3–4 times/hour); spontaneous/no triggers; stable intensity and frequency; explicit pertinent negatives (no dyspnea, no fever, no N/V, no abdominal pain). Overall coverage is well under 50% of the gold details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are traceable to the transcript (cough duration, early mucus, now dry cough, chest discomfort when coughing, reflux history). The main faithfulness issue is framing reflux as a symptom of the two-week illness (contextual misattribution) and overstating chest pain rather than cough-related soreness. These are distortions rather than fully fabricated facts.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on symptoms during the illness and which resolved vs persisted. The inclusion of acid reflux is a minor tangent because it is not part of the acute two-week illness symptoms asked about. Otherwise, it addresses the question."
