  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The four reported symptoms are correctly identified as fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, and muscle aches, consistent with the Gold Answer. The denied symptom list (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing) matches the Gold Answer, but the Generated Answer’s rationale is partly incorrect: it claims the patient ‘effectively denied’ these symptoms merely by not reporting them initially, whereas the transcript shows she explicitly denied them when asked (e.g., nausea/vomiting [P-5], neck stiffness [P-7], headache [P-8], cough [P-10], difficulty swallowing [P-24–P-26]). It also incorrectly cites [P-1] as support for the denials.",
    "completeness": "Includes all four key reported symptoms from the Gold Answer. It also includes all five clinically significant denied symptoms asked about in the question. However, it omits the paired denial of vomiting alongside nausea (Gold: ‘nausea and vomiting’), and it does not capture the specific swallowing clarification (‘it just hurts’ but can swallow solids/liquids without coughing/aspiration).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded as written: the claim that ‘by not reporting these symptoms… she effectively denied them’ is an unsupported inference and contradicts the fact that explicit denials occurred later. Citations for denied symptoms are inaccurate (pointing to [P-1] rather than [P-5], [P-7], [P-8], [P-10], [P-24–P-26]). Overall, key content is present but documentation/citation is unreliable.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question (four reported symptoms and denials of the specified symptoms). Minor extraneous commentary about [P-1] not including those symptoms and the incorrect inference about ‘effective denial’ reduces focus slightly."
