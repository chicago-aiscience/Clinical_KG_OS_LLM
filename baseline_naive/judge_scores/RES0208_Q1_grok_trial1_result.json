  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is mostly factually accurate with correct citations to transcript for symptoms like loss of taste (minor quote mangling with double negative but intent matches [P-4]), dry cough [P-8], muscle aches [P-20], feverish sensation [P-4], loss of appetite [P-4], and malaise [P-1]. However, it inaccurately states the patient 'believes he may be having more than usual' headaches [P-11], contradicting the transcript where he says 'I don't think I'm getting any more than usual'; main points of symptoms are correct but this is a notable error, plus omission of some symptoms leads to partial consistency with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: loss of taste [P-4], dry cough [P-7/8], muscle aches [P-20/21], fever [P-4], decreased appetite [P-2/4/18], headaches [P-11-13]. Missed: diminished sense of smell [P-6] and its novelty [P-5], sore throat [P-9], denial of runny nose/congestion [P-10], general weakness [P-2]. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-4], [P-8], [P-20]). Minor issues: taste quote slightly mangled ('I don't really feel like I couldn't really taste' introduces confusing double negative, but paraphrases correctly); headache description hallucinates 'more than usual' belief contradicting [P-11]. Mostly grounded, minor unverifiable interpretive detail.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by categorizing symptoms exactly as specified (sensory changes, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional) with no off-topic content or tangents."
