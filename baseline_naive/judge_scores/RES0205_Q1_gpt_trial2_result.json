  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the key ongoing symptom of a 2-week cough that is now dry and notes early mucus. However, it inaccurately frames “chest pain” as a present symptom: the patient explicitly denies chest pain and instead reports chest soreness only after coughing a lot ([P-15], [P-16]). It also lists “acid reflux” as a current symptom, which is a chronic condition mentioned in past history rather than a symptom of the two-week illness asked about.",
    "completeness": "Captured: persistent 2-week cough; transition from early mucus to dry cough; vague reference to early “flu symptoms.”\nMissed key resolved symptoms: sore throat (first 2–3 days) and runny nose (initially), and the description of mucus as whitish/clear and lasting 4–5 days.\nMissed key persisting details: cough frequency (3–4 times/hour), spontaneous/no triggers, unchanged intensity/frequency over time, and the nuance of chest soreness only with excessive coughing.\nAlso omitted explicitly denied associated symptoms (e.g., fever, dyspnea), which are included in the gold answer’s symptom inventory.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (cough, earlier mucus, early flu-like symptoms, reflux as a condition). However, the answer misrepresents the chest symptom (pain vs soreness after coughing, and the patient denies independent chest pain), which reduces faithfulness. Including acid reflux as part of the illness symptoms is not supported by the question context and is not presented as part of the acute two-week complaint.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on illness-related symptoms (cough course, early flu-like symptoms). However, adding acid reflux is not responsive to the question about symptoms during the two-week illness and introduces irrelevant history."
