  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the quality ('sharp', 'strong') and duration (20 minutes). However, it suggests physical exertion/running might be a trigger, which contradicts the patient's statement in [P-10] that they don't think it gets worse with exercise and that walking stays the same.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it omits the initial description of the pain as 'uncomfortable' or 'odd' [P-2], and completely fails to mention the situations where the pain resolves (talking to people, doing hands-on tasks), which was explicitly requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims regarding quality and duration are well-supported by the transcript. The suggestion that physical exertion is a trigger is speculative and leans toward hallucination given the patient's denial in [P-10].",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it ignores the second half of the situational prompt ('versus resolve'). It focuses only on when the pain occurs."
