  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key asthma-consistent symptoms reported in the transcript (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) and correctly links increased bronchodilator reliance to worsening asthma in a patient with established asthma. However, it contains minor inaccuracies/weak citations (it cites D-14 for dry cough, but the patient’s confirmation is P-14) and it omits an important symptom explicitly asked in the question (chest tightness), which makes the symptom-combination claim not fully accurate relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) classic asthma symptom cluster including dry cough, SOB, wheeze, **chest tightness**; (2) known asthma since age 8; (3) bronchodilator provides relief; (4) rescue use increase **from once every ~2 weeks to 5–6x/week**; (5) wheezing occurs even more often than inhaler use; (6) triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen/spring); (7) negative infectious screen (no URI, fever, sick contacts, travel, anosmia, productive cough, GI symptoms); (8) implies asthma exacerbation/med adjustment. Generated Answer covers (1) partially (misses chest tightness), (2), and (4) only qualitatively (no baseline→current frequency numbers), but misses (3), (5), (6), (7), and (8). Overall it captures less than half of the Gold Answer’s key supporting elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (dry cough, SOB, wheeze, increased inhaler use, asthma history, family history). The mention that a “knowledge graph supports” the conclusion is not present in the transcript and is an ungrounded addition. Aside from that and a minor citation issue, it does not introduce major fabricated clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on whether the symptom pattern plus increased bronchodilator use indicates worsening asthma rather than a new condition. However, it does not directly address the full symptom combination specified in the question (it omits chest tightness) and does not explicitly include the dramatic change in use frequency (once/2 weeks → 5–6/week), reducing how directly it answers what was asked."
