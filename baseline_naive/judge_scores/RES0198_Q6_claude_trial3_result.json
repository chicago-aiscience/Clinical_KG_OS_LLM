  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. Both identify the working diagnosis as a viral infection/common cold, list the same supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold), mention the COVID swab test with 48-hour results, and describe the isolation instructions and public health follow-up. The Generated Answer correctly cites [D-39] throughout and does not introduce any factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) working diagnosis of viral infection/common cold, (2) supportive care recommendations including hydration and OTC medications (Tylenol Cold), (3) expectation that symptoms take time to resolve, (4) COVID swab ordered for today with 48-hour turnaround, (5) isolation instructions while awaiting results, and (6) follow-up instructions from public health after results. The Generated Answer includes all essential elements, though it structures them slightly differently using bullet points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in [D-39]. The answer accurately cites the doctor's statement about viral infection, the supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold), the COVID swab test, the 48-hour timeline, the isolation instructions, and the public health follow-up. There are no hallucinated facts or unsupported claims. The repeated [KG] citations appear to be formatting artifacts but don't represent hallucinations of content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question, which asked for the doctor's complete management plan including diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance. The answer is well-organized with clear sections for each component requested. There is no irrelevant content, and the answer stays focused on the management plan communicated at the end of the visit."

All information is accurately grounded in the transcript [D-39] with no hallucinations or factual errors. The answer is perfectly relevant and well-organized, addressing all aspects of the question systematically."
