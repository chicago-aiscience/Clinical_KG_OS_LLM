  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies that symptoms began ~2 weeks ago with an ongoing cough [P-2], that there were early “flu-like”/URI symptoms that resolved while the cough persisted [P-14], and that the cough is now dry after initially having mucus [P-5]. However, it contains notable inaccuracies compared with the Gold Answer: it implies the productive-to-dry transition occurred after 2–3 days, whereas the transcript specifies mucus for the first 4–5 days before becoming dry [P-6]. It also omits the mucus description (“whitish clear”) and overstates the cough as “frequent and intense enough” to cause chest pain; the transcript describes occasional cough-related chest soreness when coughing “too much,” not an overall increase in intensity/frequency [P-15, P-16].",
    "completeness": "It misses multiple key elements required by the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) mucus appearance (“whitish clear”) and correct duration (first 4–5 days) [P-6]; (2) explicit sore throat course (present 2–3 days then resolved) [P-13]; (3) runny nose and “everything else resolved” by 3–4 days [P-14]; (4) cough intensity staying the same over 2 weeks [P-7]; (5) cough frequency not increasing and estimated 3–4 times/hour [P-8, P-9]; (6) spontaneous/no trigger [P-10]; (7) no fever at any point [P-12]; (8) COVID test negative at onset and stayed home awaiting improvement [P-35, P-36]. Overall, it captures only a portion of the requested timeline details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are generally grounded in the transcript (persistent cough ~2 weeks, early mucus then dry, other symptoms resolved). However, several details are not supported or are misrepresented: the 2–3 day timing for the productive-to-dry transition is inconsistent with [P-6], and citing [P-13] as “flu-like symptoms for the first two or three days” is not precise (that line is specifically about sore throat). The characterization of the cough as currently “frequent and intense enough” is more interpretive than stated and not aligned with the patient reporting stable intensity/frequency [P-7, P-8].",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on symptom progression over time, which is what the question asks. It does not add unrelated content, but it fails to address several requested components (mucus characteristics/duration, frequency/intensity trend, fever, triggers), making it only partially responsive to the full prompt."
