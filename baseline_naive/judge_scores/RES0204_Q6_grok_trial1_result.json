  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details the plan including initial chat/exam/consult/return [D-1], specific tests (CXR might per supervising [D-37], COVID swab standard [D-39]), age-appropriate explanations, consultation details [D-37], follow-up arrange tests/return with doc [D-40], agreement/thanks. Generated covers consultation, both tests with accurate cites/phrasing, follow-up/next steps. Minor discrepancy: Generated sequences tests 'following consultation' but transcript proposes tests before/while planning consult [D-37-40]; omits physical exam of lungs/heart [D-1]; no mention of explanations. Core facts consistent, minor issues.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: structured plan (chat/exam/consult/return), CXR (might/supervising), COVID swab (standard), explanations (age-appropriate), consultation (go get supervising doc), follow-up (arrange/return/talk next steps), acknowledgment. Generated covers: consultation, both tests, follow-up/next steps (with goal mention). Misses: physical exam [D-1], age-appropriate explanations [D-38-39], exact 'arrange' phrasing, patient agreement. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: consultation [D-1,D-37], CXR [D-37], COVID swab reason/paraphrase accurate [D-39], follow-up [D-1,D-37,D-40], Rollercoaster [D-37]. Citations precise. Minor unverifiable: 'preliminary findings' implies exam/review but transcript shows history done, exam planned not performed; 'current health climate' plausible paraphrase of 'these symptoms lately'. No hallucinations, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around question elements (consultation, tests, follow-up) with clear headings matching query; no off-topic content, perfectly addresses describing the communicated plan."
