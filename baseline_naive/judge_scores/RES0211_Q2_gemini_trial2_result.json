  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the medications identified (Claritin, Deyo) and the past treatment (allergy shots). It correctly states she is not currently taking Claritin but has it with her.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific details requested by the prompt and present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the dosing/frequency details: the birth control 'goes for three months' and the allergy shots were administered 'once a week for a little while, like in the winter.' It also fails to mention that she does not carry an EpiPen, which is relevant to the prompt's question about what she is 'carrying.'",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All points mentioned are supported by the provided text with correct citations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant and directly addresses the prompt's questions about current medications and past treatments."
