  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition both patient (P-1) and doctor (D-39) agreed needed ruling out, matching Gold. Test as 'swab' for COVID-19 (D-39), turnaround '48 hours' (D-39), and isolation instructions (D-39) are exact matches. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'acknowledged' vs 'stated') but no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key question elements: condition (COVID-19 with citations), test (swab), turnaround (48 hours), instructions (isolation). Matches Gold's core points; omits minor details like 'today' for test and post-results public health instructions, but these are not central to 'instructions while awaiting' (covers ~95%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-1, D-39). No hallucinations; mentions 'knowledge graph' but facts grounded in provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the four-part question with bullet points; no off-topic content."
