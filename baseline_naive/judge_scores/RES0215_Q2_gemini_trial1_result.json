  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding the medications it mentions (Reactine for allergies and the lack of prescribed medications). It matches the Gold Answer's information for those specific points.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a key part of the question: it does not mention whether any treatments are used for the 'current respiratory episodes' (the Gold Answer specifies that the mother gives nothing and they resolve with rest). It also omits the historical detail that past viral infections did not require antibiotics.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is generally grounded in the transcript. However, it references a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the provided source text (a minor hallucination of source attribution, though the medical fact itself is in the transcript).",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but fails to address the first half of the prompt regarding treatments for the current respiratory episodes, focusing only on the allergies and prescription status."
