  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Ventolin (misspelled as Ventilin) and Spiriva as prior respiratory inhalers from [P-11], matching Gold. However, it incorrectly states no non-respiratory medications were mentioned, missing atorvastatin ('Torva Staten') from [P-38/D-39]. It denies a specific Ventolin frequency despite [P-12] stating ~10 times past week. It also incorrectly claims no discontinued medications, ignoring the diuretic stopped without approval [P-35/P-36]. These are significant omissions and contradictions to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: (1) Ventolin & Spiriva; (2) Ventolin ~10x/week [P-11/P-12]; (3) atorvastatin [P-38]; (4) discontinued diuretic w/o approval [P-35/P-36]. Generated covers only (1) partially (~25%), misses (2),(3),(4) entirely (<20% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on inhalers verifiable [P-11]. But 'no non-respiratory drugs' ignores [P-38]; Ventolin frequency claim ignores [P-12] quantification; discontinued med denial ignores [P-35/P-36]. Multiple ungrounded negations/hallucinated absences.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response directly around question's three parts (meds, Ventolin freq, discontinued med), with headings; no off-topic content, fully focused despite errors."
