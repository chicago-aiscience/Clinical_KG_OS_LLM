  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It misses the patient's most concerning symptom (difficulty breathing) and the reduced sense of taste. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims that symptoms like cough, runny nose, fever, and chest pain were not explicitly denied, when the transcript clearly shows the patient answering 'No' to each of these specific questions.",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete. It misses two major reported symptoms (difficulty breathing and reduced sense of taste) and fails to list six out of the seven explicitly denied symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a false claim that the symptoms were 'simply absent' and not 'explicitly denied'. This contradicts the source transcript where the patient explicitly denies these symptoms in response to the doctor's direct questions (P-15 through P-18, P-23).",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant in structure as it attempts to categorize symptoms as reported or denied, but the content within those categories is largely inaccurate or missing."
