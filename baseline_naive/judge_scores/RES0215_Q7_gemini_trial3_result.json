  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the nocturnal episode, stating it occurred 'during the visit,' whereas the transcript [P-43] clearly states it was 'one night' prior to the consultation. It also incorrectly attributes the 'fluctuating' pattern to historical infections [P-15] rather than the specific exercise-induced pattern of the current symptoms described in the Gold Answer (symptoms recurring with activity and resolving with rest).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention that the cough was non-productive (no phlegm). 2) It does not explain that the fluctuating symptoms resolved specifically with rest. 3) It omits pertinent negatives such as the absence of fever and the child appearing well between episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that a nocturnal episode happened 'during the visit' is a hallucination/misinterpretation of the transcript. The transcript says it happened 'one night' in the past. Other details are grounded in the text, but the linkage of the 'fluctuating' nature to 2-year-old infections is a slight distortion of the question's focus on the current 4-5 day progression.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, addressing all specific components of the question (onset, trigger, pattern, cough, and nocturnal episode) using the provided headers."
