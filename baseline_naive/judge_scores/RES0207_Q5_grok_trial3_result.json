  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies medication non-adherence as a risk factor with accurate citations to [P-9] and [P-23] for forgetting Keppra, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it factually errs by stating no hereditary risk factors or family history exist, directly contradicting the transcript [P-26] where the patient states 'epilepsy runs in the family. My mom had it,' which the Gold Answer highlights as key. It also incorrectly denies family history relation to the epilepsy diagnosis. These are significant contradictions on core elements.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) hereditary risk (epilepsy runs in family, mom had it [P-26]); (2) medication non-adherence (missed Keppra [P-23], due to daughter's birthday [P-24], infrequent seizures normally [P-9]); (3) family history relates to patient's epilepsy diagnosis; (4) combination precipitated seizure. Generated covers medication non-adherence partially ([P-9], Keppra [P-23]) but misses context ([P-24], [P-9] details), entirely omits hereditary/family history and relation to diagnosis. Covers ~25-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Medication claims verifiable in transcript [P-9, P-23]. However, asserts no hereditary factors or family history despite explicit [P-26] evidence, fabricating absence. References non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' for Keppra, which is hallucinated (not in transcript). Multiple unverifiable negative claims and external reference indicate hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to directly address medication risks, hereditary risks, and family history per the question, with bullet points mirroring question components. Minor irrelevant mention of 'Knowledge Graph,' but no major off-topic content."
