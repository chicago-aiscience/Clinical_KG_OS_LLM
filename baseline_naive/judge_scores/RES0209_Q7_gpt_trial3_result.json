  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the asthma diagnosis at age eight (P-2) and describes the recent exacerbation symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheeze) consistent with the transcript (P-1, P-15). However, it inaccurately cites “last two weeks” as coming from D-14 (the timeline clarification is at P-13/D-13), and it implies a “long-standing” history without noting the patient is now 10 (i.e., ~2-year history). It also fails to report the key quantified bronchodilator frequencies (once every two weeks baseline; now 5–6 times/week).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: diagnosis at age 8; current exacerbation over ~2 weeks; presence of dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing; increased bronchodilator use in general terms.\nKey points missed: patient now age 10 (2-year history); baseline bronchodilator use “once every two weeks”; current near-daily use “5–6 times per week”; that wheezing occurs more often than inhaler use (uses only when very hard to breathe); nighttime symptoms every other day/every two days; chest tightness; typical triggers (exercise/cold) and some seasonal pattern; denial of infectious precipitant screening (no sick contacts, no fever, etc.). Overall coverage is well under half of the Gold Answer’s clinical progression details.",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “knowledge graph” and “[KG]” are not present in the provided source. There is also a citation error (assigning the ‘last two weeks’ timeframe to D-14). Most symptom statements are otherwise supported by the transcript, but the inclusion of non-transcript sources and incorrect citation reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on the topic of symptom progression and bronchodilator use and does not introduce major tangents. However, it does not directly answer the full evolution requested (especially the quantified baseline vs current use and intervening features like nocturnal symptoms and wheeze frequency), making it only partially responsive."
