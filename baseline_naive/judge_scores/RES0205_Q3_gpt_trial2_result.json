  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated, consistent with the patient’s statement that they had a COVID test and did not have it (P-35). It correctly states the test result was negative. The cited cough duration and dry nature are consistent with the transcript (P-2, P-5). A minor issue is that it frames the investigation as prompted mainly by persistent cough and hospital work; while true, the Gold Answer emphasizes additional specific prompting factors (flu-like symptoms, workplace concern).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) diagnosis investigated = COVID-19; (2) prompting evidence: hospital worker/occupational exposure, viral/flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose), persistent cough, coworkers’ fear/need to rule out COVID, PPE use noted; (3) testing: done at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior; result negative; stayed home awaiting resolution. Generated Answer includes (1) COVID-19, (part of 2) persistent cough + hospital worker, and (3) negative test. It omits the initial flu-like symptoms, coworker concern, timing of the test (~2 weeks ago at onset), PPE/being careful, and staying home after testing.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript: COVID test and negative result (P-35), persistent cough and dry cough (P-2, P-5), hospital worker status (P-34/P-17). The statement that hospital work “may heighten suspicion” is a reasonable inference but not explicitly stated as the reason for testing in the transcript; still, it does not introduce concrete false facts.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements (diagnosis investigated, evidence prompting investigation, and what testing showed) without irrelevant tangents."
