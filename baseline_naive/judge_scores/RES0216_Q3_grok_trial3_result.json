  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma reoccurring as the top differential (matching Gold's D-35) and links presenting symptoms (chest tightness, dyspnea on exertion from P-1, P-7), history of asthma (P-16), absence of cardiac pain (D-36), and proposes rescue puffers (D-35). However, it inaccurately frames 'current use of salbutamol' (P-25) as a linking factor without noting the key Gold point of medication limitation (skipping evening dose P-19, no rescue refill P-17/18, D-34). It also adds 'physically listening to lungs' as confirmation plan (accurate from D-35 but minor). Core facts align with minor discrepancies on medication nuance.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) D-35 top differential ✓; (2) asthma history P-16/P-29 ✓; (3) medication limiting (skipping night P-19, no rescue P-17/18, D-34) ✗ (only mentions salbutamol use, misses non-adherence); (4) symptoms chest tightness/exertion/difficulty breathing P-1/7/9/10 ✓ partially; (5) patient notes different but related P-16 partial; (6) no triggers P-33 ✗; (7) no cardiac indicators D-36 ✓; (8) therapeutic trial rescue puffers D-35 ✓. Covers ~60-70% (symptoms, history, cardiac ruleout, trial), misses medication non-compliance (central to Gold), triggers.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: symptoms P-1/P-7; history P-16; salbutamol P-25; cardiac D-36; rescue puffers/physical exam D-35. Citations accurate to transcript. No hallucinations; interpretations like exertion-related and ruling out cardiac directly from D-36/D-35. Grounded throughout.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by detailing symptom-history linkage to asthma diagnosis, with structured breakdown mirroring question's focus on combination and doctor's reasoning process. No off-topic content."
