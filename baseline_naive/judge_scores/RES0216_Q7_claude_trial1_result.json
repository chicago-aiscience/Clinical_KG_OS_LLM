  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors and omissions compared to the Gold Answer. Most critically, it fails to mention that the patient explicitly stated symptoms have been 'staying the same' [P-2, P-3], instead stating this information is not in the transcript. It also misses key details about baseline symptoms being 'always there' but worse with activity [P-9, P-10], the specific exacerbating factors (getting up from chair, taking deep breaths), and the quantified impact on walking frequency (reduced from multiple walks to one per day) [P-22]. The answer does correctly identify the 3-day timeline, walking as triggering activity, and general nature of symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It addresses: onset timing (3 days), first occurrence during walk [P-4], walking as exacerbating factor, and impact on daily routine. However, it completely omits: the explicit statement that symptoms are 'staying the same' [P-2], the 'nothing in particular' trigger [P-3], baseline persistent nature of symptoms [P-9], additional exacerbating factors (rising from chair, deep breaths) [P-9], specific reduction from multiple walks to one walk daily [P-22], no missed work [P-22], and the assessment that symptoms are noticeable but not dramatically impairing [P-23].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript but contains one significant error. It incorrectly states 'The transcript does not explicitly state whether the symptoms have improved, worsened, or remained static' when the patient clearly says 'I think it's staying the same' [P-2] and 'it's been pretty steady' [P-3]. All other claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-16]. No hallucinated content is present, but the failure to acknowledge explicitly stated information is a faithfulness issue.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question and stays focused on the requested information about symptom development, evolution, triggering activity, exacerbating factors, and impact on walking routine. All content is relevant to the question. However, the organization could be clearer, and some bullet points overlap in content rather than distinctly addressing each aspect of the multi-part question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a partially correct response that addresses the main aspects of the question but contains significant omissions and one factual error. It correctly identifies the 3-day timeline, walking as the triggering and exacerbating activity, and general impact on routine. However, it fails to include the patient's explicit statement that symptoms are 'staying the same,' omits multiple key exacerbating factors (rising from chair, deep breaths), and lacks specific quantification of the functional impact (reduction from multiple to one walk daily, no work missed). The faithfulness is compromised by incorrectly claiming the transcript doesn't state symptom progression when this is explicitly addressed. The answer remains relevant throughout but would benefit from more complete coverage of the source material."
