  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses critical reported symptoms like difficulty breathing (P-7 to P-11), reduced sense of taste (P-19 to P-22), and details such as sore throat worsening (P-4) and fatigue/muscle aches timing (P-26); it incorrectly treats past mono sore throat as a current symptom detail; for denials, it only lists loss of smell and falsely claims other screened symptoms (cough P-15 'No', runny nose P-16 'No', headaches P-17 'No', chest pain P-18 'No', fever P-23 'I don't think so') were not explicitly denied, contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered partially: sore throat onset and severity (partial), difficulty swallowing food (yes), fatigue and muscle aches (yes); completely misses difficulty breathing, reduced taste, sore throat progression, symptom timings/details, and all but one denial (loss of smell); covers ~30% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms and citations (P-2, P-5, P-25) are verifiable in transcript; loss of smell denial (P-19) accurate; however, the note hallucinates that cough/runny nose/etc. were not explicitly denied despite direct 'No' responses in transcript (P-15 to P-18), introducing erroneous interpretation.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around reported symptoms and explicitly denied commonly screened symptoms, matching the question's two parts with no off-topic content aside from minor past history mention."
