  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error by claiming that there is 'no information available' regarding the patient's family history or hereditary risk factors. In the transcript, the patient explicitly states, 'Yeah, epilepsy runs in the family. My mom had it' [P-26].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer only addresses the medication-related risk factors (Keppra non-adherence). It fails to cover the hereditary risk factors and the specific connection between family history and the epilepsy diagnosis, which were key components of the Gold Answer and the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits a failure in faithfulness by asserting that the provided clinical information does not specify hereditary factors or family history. This is a negative hallucination, as the information is clearly present in the source text at turn [P-26].",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it correctly identifies the medication-related risk, it completely misses the other half of the prompt regarding heredity and family history."
