  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer in all clinical details. It correctly identifies the tests (X-ray, COVID swab), the examination (chest), the isolation instructions (staying away from wife), the timeline (24-48 hours), and the decision criteria (based on results).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all parts of the multi-part question, including the specific person (public health nurse) mentioned in the context of follow-up instructions.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript [D-37]. However, the mention of a 'knowledge graph' is an external reference not found in the source text, which technically constitutes a minor breach of faithfulness to the provided source, though it does not affect the clinical accuracy.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, structured well to address each sub-component of the prompt, and contains no unnecessary tangents other than the brief 'knowledge graph' meta-comment."
