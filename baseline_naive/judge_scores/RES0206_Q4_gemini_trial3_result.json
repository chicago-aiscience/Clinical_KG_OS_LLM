  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19) and the test ordered (COVID swab). However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain details about social contacts. The Gold Answer and transcript clearly specify the patient had contact with a sick friend while walking dogs [P-20]. The Generated Answer incorrectly attributes the consideration solely to clinical symptoms like fever and sputum production.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the condition and the test but completely misses the third part of the question regarding social contacts. It fails to mention the sick friend or the dog-walking context, which is a key component of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a 'hallucination of absence.' It claims the information about social contacts is not in the transcript, whereas [P-20] and [D-21] explicitly discuss this topic. This is a direct contradiction of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, addressing each part of the prompt directly, even though the content provided for the third part is factually incorrect."
