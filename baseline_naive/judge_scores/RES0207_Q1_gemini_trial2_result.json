    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate regarding the symptoms it lists (shortness of breath, seizure, temperature of 37.4). It does not contradict the Gold Answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is significantly less complete than the Gold Answer. It misses the second respiratory symptom (dry cough), which was explicitly requested by the plural 'respiratory symptoms' in the prompt. It also omits contextual details like the duration/timing of symptoms, the patient's epilepsy diagnosis, and all pertinent negatives included in the Gold Answer.",

    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's questions, though it fails to identify all the symptoms mentioned in the source."
