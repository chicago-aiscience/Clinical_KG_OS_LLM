  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the '40-year smoking history' is not mentioned in the transcript, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence [P-35: 'I smoked for 40 years'] and [P-34: quit two years ago]; it fails to link smoking to COPD causation as in Gold, instead relying on medication and a non-existent knowledge graph; correctly identifies COPD diagnosis [P-27] and medication [P-28], COVID suspicion [D-43], and chest X-ray [D-43], but core factual relation is wrong.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 40-year smoking [P-35]/quit 2y [P-34] causes COPD [P-27]; new/worsening/constant SOB unlike past [P-8-11]; CXR [D-43]; COVID alignment [D-43]; lives alone/retired/minimal exposure [P-33,39,12]. Generated covers COPD/meds, SOB/COVID symptoms, swab/CXR, vulnerability; misses smoking history entirely (denies it), quit timing, SOB specifics (new/constant/worsening/unlike past), patient context (alone/retired/exposure). Covers ~30-40% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims smoking history absent from transcript (false, [P-35]); cites non-existent 'knowledge graph' [KG] repeatedly for symptoms/COVID/meds; verifiable parts: COPD [P-27], med [P-28], sore throat [P-2], COVID note/swab/CXR [D-43]; multiple hallucinations including KG invention and denying transcript facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around smoking-COPD relation (though erroneously) and COPD relevance to SOB/suspected COVID (vulnerability, eval needs); minor tangents via KG references but focused on question."
