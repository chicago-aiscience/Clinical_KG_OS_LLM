  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer by stating there is “no information available” about (1) father’s allergies, (2) cousin’s asthma, (3) brother’s recent cold, and (4) farm/COVID home-schooling situation—each of which is explicitly documented in the transcript ([P-33], [P-30], [P-39], [P-41]-[P-45]). It also introduces an unsupported claim that a “Knowledge Graph indicates” a diagnosis of common cold, which is not present in the transcript or Gold Answer. While it correctly restates some symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, feeling hot) and her allergy history, the core requested contextual interpretation is incorrect and missing.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: essentially none of the requested contextual linkage (family history relevance, allergy season not started, brother as likely viral exposure, relative isolation due to farm/home-schooling/COVID, no travel, dog only reducing animal exposure). Key points missed: all of the above. The answer instead focuses on symptoms and an unsupported diagnosis claim, failing to address the collective relationship asked in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not faithful to the transcript: it claims absence of information that is clearly present, and it adds an extraneous ‘Knowledge Graph’ diagnosis of common cold. It also implies night sweats are part of the symptom set, whereas the transcript documents the clinician asked about night sweats and the patient mainly reports feeling hot; it is not documented as true night sweats. Overall, the response contains major ungrounded or contradictory assertions.",
    "relevance": "The question asks how the family history, brother’s cold, and living situation collectively relate to current symptoms. The Generated Answer does not provide that relationship and instead claims the information is unavailable, then shifts to summarizing symptoms and an unsupported diagnosis. This is only minimally related to the question."
