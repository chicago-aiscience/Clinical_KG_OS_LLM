  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s prescribed medication for epilepsy (matches Gold: P-23, P-8). It is also true that the patient forgot to take their medication (P-9). However, it does not provide the specific situational trigger for the missed dose (daughter’s birthday / altered dinner routine), which is required by the question and included in the Gold Answer. The statement about being “supported by the knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) medication = Keppra, (2) chronic condition = epilepsy, (3) that a dose was missed/forgotten.\nMissed: the specific circumstance causing the missed dose—daughter’s birthday celebration, changed routine, celebration earlier, no usual dinner time leading to forgetting; also the context that this was an isolated lapse rather than ongoing adherence issues and the link the patient made between missing the dose and having a seizure.",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is grounded in the transcript (Keppra and forgetting the med). The reference to a “knowledge graph” as supporting evidence is not present in the transcript and is an unverifiable addition, though it does not change the clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic and attempts to answer both parts, but it fails to answer the key part of the second question (the specific circumstance leading to the missed dose), so it is only partially responsive."
