  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer specifies 'fevers and fatigue and muscle aches' strictly for general infectious process (constitutional symptoms). 'Difficulty breathing' is grouped by Gold as part of 'additional distinct symptoms' for COVID concern, along with 'sore throat and cough'. Generated Answer incorrectly adds 'difficulty breathing' to infectious process symptoms (factual error vs Gold) and omits it from COVID symptoms (another discrepancy), listing only sore throat and cough. While symptoms are from transcript, this misgrouping contradicts Gold's precise categorization of doctor's citations. Main symptoms are correct, but significant attribution errors. Score: 3.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1. Infectious process: fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (covered, but wrongly adds SOB). 2. Additional COVID symptoms: difficulty breathing + sore throat + cough (covers only 2/3, misses SOB). 3. Taste/smell not explicitly cited in D-36 assessment (not addressed). 4. Respiratory focus basis for COVID, leading to swab/isolation (not covered). Covers core symptoms but incomplete distinctions and misses ~30% of precise points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from D-36: 'fevers and fatigue and muscle aches, and then the difficulty breathing... sore throat and cough'. Citations accurate [D-36]. No unverifiable or hallucinated content; grouping debatable but grounded in transcript wording. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response to match question's two-part query (infectious process symptoms vs additional COVID symptoms), with bolding and direct phrasing. No off-topic content. Score: 5."
