{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer's key facts: assessment links symptoms to COVID-19 (with correct examples from transcript), specific tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray) match exactly with proper citations, isolation instructions and conditions (isolate until results, continue if symptomatic even if negative) are verbatim consistent. No factual errors or contradictions; minor paraphrasing of X-ray purpose ('get an idea of what's going on in there') as 'evaluate internally/chest' is faithful.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: assessment phrasing and symptoms [100%]; two diagnostic tests [100%]; isolation until results and condition for continuation (symptomatic post-negative) [100%]. Missed: explicit link of X-ray to breathing difficulty (P-8/9/10) and COPD (P-27), 'heads up' framing, consultation with supervising doctor (D-1/D-44), patient acknowledgment (P-43/44). Covers ~85-90% of Gold's details, core elements fully addressed.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: symptoms (sore throat P-2, swallowing P-2, aches P-25, fatigue P-25), assessment/D-43 phrasing, tests D-43, isolation D-43. Citations accurate. No hallucinations; X-ray paraphrase grounded in context of breathing symptoms discussed earlier.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address question: assessment, management/tests, isolation instructions/conditions. No tangents or off-topic content; directly mirrors query components."
