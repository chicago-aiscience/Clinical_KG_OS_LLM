  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the details provided in the transcript and gold answer regarding specific tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, X-ray), monitoring (oxygen saturation, COVID swab), and therapeutics (steroids, antibiotics, oxygen, bronchodilators).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a few minor points mentioned in the gold answer: the 24-48 hour timeline for COVID results and the ongoing blood pressure monitoring discussed in [D-37]. It also categorizes the COVID swab as a monitoring procedure rather than a laboratory test.",
    "faithfulness": "All information in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript with correct citations provided for each point.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses all components of the user's question, providing a clear list of tests, imaging, monitoring, and interventions."
