  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the cough is dry and non-productive, matching the Gold Answer and transcript (D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6). It correctly notes the runny nose was reported (P-11). Citations are precise. No factual errors or contradictions, but it omits specifics like cough duration (4-5 days), stability ('stayed the same'), runny nose duration ('couple of days'), and exact nasal appearance ('pretty clear'), representing minor discrepancies while keeping core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) cough 4-5 days [P-2,P-4]; (2) dry [D-5,P-5]; (3) non-productive/no gunk [D-6,P-6]; (4) stayed the same [P-7]; (5) runny nose couple days [P-11]; (6) pretty clear [P-12]; (7) never had dry cough before/past runny shorter [P-24]; (8) pertinent negatives (no sore throat [P-9], chest pain [P-15], SOB/wheeze [P-28]). Covered: (2) dry cough, (3) non-productive, runny nose existence. Missed: (1),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8). Covers ~30-40% of key points, mainly core symptoms and cough nature but incomplete on durations, nasal specifics, history, negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: dry cough confirmed [D-5,P-5]; non-productive implied and stated [D-6,P-6]; runny nose [D-11,P-11]; assessment of nasal characteristics (clear/watery/thick/color) [D-12]. Citations accurate [D-5, D-11, D-12]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists the two respiratory symptoms (cough, runny nose) with requested characteristics (dry/non-productive cough; notes assessment of nasal discharge), perfectly focused on the question with no off-topic content."
