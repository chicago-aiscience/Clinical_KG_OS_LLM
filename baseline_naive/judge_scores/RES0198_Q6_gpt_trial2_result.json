{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s end-of-visit plan in D-39: working diagnosis of a viral infection/common cold; supportive care with hydration and OTC medication like Tylenol Cold; COVID swab ordered today with results in ~48 hours; isolation at home while awaiting results; and follow-up instructions from public health after results. Wording such as “rule in or out COVID-19” is a reasonable paraphrase of “we will also get a swab done for you today” due to symptom overlap, and does not contradict the transcript or Gold Answer. No material factual errors identified.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) diagnosis: viral infection/common cold; (2) supportive care: hydrate; (3) supportive care: OTC meds like Tylenol Cold; (4) COVID swab ordered today; (5) results expected in 48 hours; (6) isolate at home/not see anyone; (7) further instructions from public health after results. Missing from the Gold Answer: the explicit expectation-setting that symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve and the statement that there is “not much we can do besides supportive care.”",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by D-39. Minor paraphrasing (e.g., “avoid contact with others,” “rule in or out COVID-19”) remains faithful to the transcript’s meaning. No clear hallucinated recommendations or tests beyond what is stated.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested items: diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test ordered, and public health guidance. No meaningful irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, faithful, and highly relevant, but slightly incomplete because it omits the doctor’s expectation-setting that symptoms may take a few weeks to resolve and that little beyond supportive care is available."
