  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly explains the calculation for the 72-hour tick attachment duration based on the patient's activities on Friday and Saturday. However, it incorrectly states that information regarding Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map is missing from the transcript. This is a significant error, as these details are explicitly discussed in segments [P-12] and [D-13].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer only addresses the first half of the question. It fails to provide any information regarding the geographic justification (Strathroy's location and the Ontario map) which accounts for approximately 50% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits a significant grounding failure by claiming that specific information (Strathroy and the map) is not present in the transcript when it is clearly available in the source text provided. It appears the model only processed a limited subset of the transcript segments.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it addresses the first part of the multi-part question. However, the second part of the response is spent explaining why it cannot answer the second half of the question, which is unhelpful and based on an incorrect assessment of the source text."
