  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly reports blood-tinged sputum (“little spots of red”) [P-4], right-sided chest pain [P-17] that worsens with coughing and deep breathing [P-19], and systemic symptoms of fever/feeling off [P-5] and chills over the last two days [P-9]. It does not introduce clear factual contradictions. However, it omits key descriptors (e.g., sputum described as “yellow custard,” and chest pain described as constant and dull), which affects completeness more than accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Misses several key elements from the Gold Answer that are directly asked for:\n- Sputum color/appearance: omits “yellow custard” and that the red spots and yellow sputum started together [P-6, P-7].\n- Chest pain quality: omits that it is constant/“always there,” present even at rest/lying down, and described as dull [P-19, P-20, P-21].\n- Systemic symptoms detail: notes fever and chills but omits that fever was subjective (no measured temperature), started Monday, and persisted until the visit [P-8].\nAlso omits other symptoms in Gold Answer (dyspnea on exertion, sore/raw throat after coughing, prior runny nose, no weight loss), though not all are strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All included clinical claims are supported by the transcript and the cited lines (red spots in sputum [P-4], right-sided pain [P-17], worse with cough/deep breath [P-19], fever/feeling off [P-5], chills [P-9]). The mention of a “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript but does not add patient-specific facts.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the requested domains (sputum, chest pain, fever/chills) with no major tangents, but it fails to provide the specific requested descriptors (sputum color; chest pain quality), limiting how well it addresses the question."

  "summary": "The generated answer is accurate and transcript-grounded but omits key requested specifics—especially sputum color (“yellow custard”) and the constant/dull nature of the right-sided chest pain—making it notably incomplete."
