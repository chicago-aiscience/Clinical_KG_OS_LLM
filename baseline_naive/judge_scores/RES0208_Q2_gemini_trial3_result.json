  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer. It correctly identifies Avodart for prostate enlargement and Tums for reflux, and accurately explains the patient's independent change to his reflux regimen based on dietary findings.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key points required by the prompt: it lists both current medications, their specific indications, and details the independent change (discontinuing previous medication) along with the reason (identifying trigger foods).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is strictly grounded in the transcript [P-25, P-26, P-27]. While it identifies Tums as calcium carbonate, this is a standard clinical interpretation of the brand name mentioned in the transcript and does not detract from the faithfulness of the report.",
    "relevance": "The response is perfectly focused on the question asked. It provides a structured breakdown of the medications, conditions, and the specific change requested without irrelevant information."
