  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer and transcript. It states there are “no documented negative findings” for fever, dyspnea, sore throat, etc., but the transcript explicitly documents these negatives: no fever (P-10), no difficulty breathing (P-11), no headaches (P-12), no sore throat (P-13), no chills/night sweats (P-14), no myalgias/weakness (P-15), no chest pain (P-22), and dry cough with no sputum/blood (P-7), plus no triggers (P-21). It also omits several additional negatives noted in the Gold Answer (no chronic conditions, meds, surgeries/hospitalizations, allergies, family history). The mention of a “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript or Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key negatives from the Gold Answer largely missing: fever, dyspnea, headache, sore throat, chills/night sweats, myalgias/weakness, chest pain, sputum/blood, cough triggers, and the additional health-history negatives (no chronic conditions, meds, surgeries/hospitalizations, allergies, family history). The Generated Answer includes only positive symptoms (loss of taste/smell, dry cough) and provides no correct list of review-of-systems negatives or their clinical significance as requested.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are contradicted by the transcript (e.g., claiming absence of documented negative findings when they are clearly present). It also introduces an unverifiable element (“knowledge graph”) not present in the source. Overall, the response is not grounded in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to address the question about negative findings and their role in the clinical picture, but it largely fails to do so because it denies the existence of the negative ROS findings and instead focuses on positive symptoms. It is partially on-topic but does not answer the asked prompt."
