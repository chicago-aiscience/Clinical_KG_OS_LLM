  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the age of diagnosis, the duration of the current exacerbation (two weeks), and the core symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing). However, it lacks the specific frequency data (once every two weeks vs. 5-6 times per week) which were explicitly provided in the question and the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points found in the gold answer: the patient's current age (10), specific triggers (exercise, cold air, seasonal pollen), specific symptoms like chest tightness and nighttime occurrences, and the nuance that wheezing occurs more frequently than medication use. It also fails to restate the specific usage frequencies mentioned in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is faithful to the transcript. It mentions a 'knowledge graph' [KG] which was not provided in the context, but the clinical facts themselves are grounded in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but remains at a very high level. It summarizes the evolution of the condition but omits the quantitative details about bronchodilator usage and the specific symptom profile (nighttime symptoms, triggers) requested by the context of 'evolution over time'. Scales of 1-5 reflect this lack of depth compared to the Gold Answer's comprehensive detail set.The response mentions [KG] as a source which is not present in the input provided to the evaluator, indicating a minor hallucination of source reference but not factual content. It also ignores the specific data points provided in the question itself (1/2 weeks vs 5-6 times/week).  Average score calculated on 4, 2, 5, 4 is 3.75.  Rounded to 3.75/5. Let's adjust slightly: Completeness is poor because it ignores details explicitly provided in the prompt's question. Relevance is good but not perfect because it glosses over the 'evolution' details (triggers/night symptoms). Correctness is high. Faithfulness is high despite the KG citation label. Completeness: 2, Correctness: 4, Faithfulness: 5, Relevance: 4. Average 3.75. Let's finalize the numbers."
