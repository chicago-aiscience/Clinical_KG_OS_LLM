  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer matches the gold answer’s timeline: cough begins Wednesday night after coming home fine; cough persists and worsens Thursday with notable tiredness; by Friday the cough worsens further and fever appears for the first time (>100°F, possibly ~100.1–101°F), along with decreased appetite/disinterest in breakfast. No statements contradict the transcript or gold answer, and the temperature range given is consistent with [P-1, P-2]. Minor detail omissions (e.g., explicitly calling the cough “little dry”) do not make the included facts incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Key gold points covered: (1) cough first appeared Wednesday night; (2) cough worsened over the three days; (3) fatigue/tiredness emerged by Thursday; (4) fever emerged on Friday with approximate measured values; (5) decreased appetite on Friday. Key gold points missed: mild runny nose noted Friday [P-16]; suspected loss of taste [P-17] (though decreased appetite was included); explicit mention that Wednesday had no other symptoms; the mother’s explicit stepwise summary [P-12]; and the correction from “five days” to “three days” [P-4]. Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript citations provided (P-1, P-2, P-15, P-17). No extra symptoms or timings are introduced beyond what is stated. The answer stays within the Wednesday–Friday window and does not hallucinate details.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question by providing a day-by-day evolution from Wednesday evening through Friday, specifying cough onset, progression in severity, and timing of fever and other systemic symptoms (fatigue, decreased appetite). No irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded day-by-day timeline that answers the question, but it omits several gold-answer details (runny nose, suspected taste loss, and the explicit correction/summary of symptom duration)."
