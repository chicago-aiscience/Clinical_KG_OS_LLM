  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the patient had not tried any medications/treatments prior to the visit (consistent with the patient’s explicit “No, I haven't tried anything” at P-9) and correctly identifies the clinician’s main recommendation: COVID-19 testing via swab and self-isolation until results, with the caveat to continue isolating if symptoms persist even with a negative test (all consistent with D-39). It does not introduce incorrect clinical actions or medications.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) patient tried nothing prior to visit, (2) COVID-19 test via swab recommended, (3) self-isolate until results and possibly longer if symptoms persist.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (1) patient also confirmed taking no regular medications (D-24/P-24), (2) test turnaround estimate of “a day or two” (D-39), (3) mention that there might be other tests and that the clinician would review with the supervising doctor (D-40). Overall, it captures the core plan but omits several specific details requested/implied by the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (P-9; D-39). However, the closing line referencing a “Knowledge Graph” is not present in the transcript and implies reliance on external information, making that portion unverifiable from the provided source. No major hallucinated clinical events beyond that.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on what the patient tried before the visit and what the doctor recommended during the consultation, including isolation instructions. The brief “Knowledge Graph” remark is a minor tangent but does not substantially detract from addressing the question."

  "summary": "Accurate on the main self-treatment and recommended COVID swab/isolation plan, but misses several specific details from the gold answer (no regular meds, result timing, possible further tests/supervising physician) and includes a minor unverifiable ‘Knowledge Graph’ reference."
