  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes three epidemiological factors: husband's prior similar illness suggesting household transmission (prioritizing COVID), limited outside contacts supporting household spread over independent exposures, and lack of flu shot making influenza plausible but COVID prioritized for testing. Generated Answer covers these core facts accurately (husband's illness quoted correctly, household isolation, flu shot role), with doctor's prioritization of COVID matching Gold. Minor discrepancies include unsubstantiated claim that symptoms 'indicate COVID per knowledge graph' (not in Gold or transcript) and framing symptoms as key to COVID prioritization, but core epi facts and doctor's reasoning are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Husband's week-long symptoms [P-19/20], doctor notes household transmission prioritizes COVID [D-51/53]; 2) Limited contacts (home work [P-23/42], staying home [P-22], hiking [P-18], no sick contacts [P-17]) supports household tx; 3) No flu shot [P-53/D-53] allows flu as differential but COVID first. Generated covers all three: husband's illness for COVID priority, shared household/limited contact for infectiousness/isolation, no flu shot for flu possibility but COVID focus. Misses specific details like hiking/no sick contacts but captures 80-99% essence.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like husband's illness [P-19/20], doctor's COVID prioritization/isolation [D-53/54], flu shot [D-53/P-53] verifiable with accurate citations. However, 'knowledge graph' indicating symptoms diagnose COVID is fully fabricated (no such graph in transcript); assertion that fever/sore throat 'indicate a diagnosis of covid' or provide 'overwhelming evidence' for COVID is hallucinated (doctor calls both possibilities, no symptom specificity stated); 'treatment protocol' of isolation is interpretive but grounded. Multiple hallucinated elements present.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three specified epi factors (husband, household/contact, flu shot) and their role in shaping COVID-primary vs flu-secondary DDx, mirroring question. Minor tangents on symptoms and 'knowledge graph' but overall perfectly focused on epi influences per transcript."
