  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript contains only Patient responses (P-1 to P-28) with no Doctor dialogue (D-turns), which is false as the transcript includes numerous Doctor turns (e.g., D-1 to D-33). It fails to identify any conditions or questions, directly contradicting the Gold Answer's detailed listing of six ruled-out conditions (traumatic injury, cardiac disease, infectious illness, asthma, primary dyspnea, inherited arrhythmia) with specific citations. No factual alignment; entirely erroneous.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers six key conditions with specific questions/lines of inquiry and patient denials: (1) Traumatic injury [D-5]; (2) Cardiac [D-10, D-20, D-11]; (3) Infectious [D-12, D-27]; (4) Asthma [D-23/24]; (5) Dyspnea [D-19]; (6) Arrhythmia [D-31/32]. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, providing no identifications or citations.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of all Doctor dialogue, despite the transcript being fully grounded with alternating D and P turns (e.g., D-1 prompts patient's chest pain clarification in P-1). No claims are verifiable; entirely fabricated transcript description. Patient history details mentioned are present but irrelevant to the false premise.",
    "relevance": "The question requires listing specific doctor-screened conditions ruled out via questions/responses; Generated Answer refuses to answer based on a false transcript claim, providing no relevant content or analysis."
