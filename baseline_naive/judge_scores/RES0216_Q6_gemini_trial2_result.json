  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the recurrence of asthma as the primary assessment, the plan to listen to the lungs, the recommendation for rescue puffers (salbutamol), and the contingency to 'come back to the table'. It accurately reflects the core clinical facts provided in the transcript and aligns with the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points: assessment, physical exam (lungs), initial treatment (rescue puffers), and contingency. However, it misses two details mentioned in the gold answer: the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician ('the doc') and the explicit mention of a 'one thing at a time' stepwise approach mentioned in D-36.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally grounded in the transcript. However, it includes an external reference '[KG]' (Knowledge Graph) which is not part of the provided source transcript, constituting a minor hallucination or artifact from the model's internal processing. It correctly identifies the patient's mention of salbutamol from P-25.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the user's question regarding assessment, physical exam, first-step treatment, and contingency plans."
