  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the asthma history and the lack of a rescue inhaler. However, it fails to address the 'skipping the evening dose' of the maintenance inhaler, which was a specific component of the question. It quotes P-17 to say the patient takes the daily inhaler, but omits the context from P-19 where the patient admits to skipping half the prescribed dosage.",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete as it misses one of the three core elements of the prompt: the self-directed decision to skip the evening dose of the maintenance inhaler. It also misses clinical details found in the Gold Answer such as the patient's report of increased phlegm, hoarseness, and the sensation feeling 'different' than previous episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer repeatedly cites a 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' which is not present in the provided source transcript. This is a significant hallucination of an external source/structure to justify clinical links that should have been drawn from the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question and attempts to structure a relationship between the history, symptoms, and medication issues, although it omits a key part of the requested analysis."
