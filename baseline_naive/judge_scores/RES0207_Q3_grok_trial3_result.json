{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer's core facts: missed Keppra dose linked to seizure on the same/previous night per patient's attribution, with direct quote from P-9 showing recognition. No factual errors or contradictions; minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'probable cause' vs. 'directly connected') but consistent with patient's view emphasized in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: missed dose (Keppra identified P-23) as cause of seizure (P-8 context), patient's explicit recognition via P-9 quote. Missed: details of disrupted dinner routine and daughter's birthday from P-24 explaining the lapse; infrequency of seizures from P-9; spontaneous nature in response to D-9; explicit note of no clinician confirmation. Covers ~60-70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: P-9 quote exact; P-8 confirms seizure/epilepsy night before; P-23 names Keppra. Patient attribution phrased accurately without adding unsubstantiated clinician opinion. Citations precise, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of question: explains connection (missed dose precipitating seizure via patient attribution) and evidence of patient's recognition (P-9 quote with context), no off-topic content."
