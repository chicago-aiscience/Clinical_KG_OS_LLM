  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum, hemoptysis) and most systemic symptoms (fever, sinus pressure). It correctly identifies the cough as the most bothersome. However, it includes 'High Blood Pressure' as a systemic symptom of the acute worsening, whereas the transcript [P-22] identifies it as a chronic medical condition mentioned in response to a question about general history.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two symptoms mentioned in the gold answer: reduced exercise tolerance (specifically the difficulty walking the dog/around the block [P-4]) and the mild headache [P-14]. It also omits the pertinent negatives listed in the gold answer, although these were not explicitly requested as 'symptoms reported'.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms listed are grounded in the transcript with correct speaker citations. No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the specific question regarding respiratory and systemic symptoms and the most bothersome symptom."
