  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine/OTC for seasonal allergies [P-36] and no prescribed medications [P-36], consistent with Gold. However, it omits the explicit statement that no medications are given for current respiratory episodes [P-33, P-34] and past viral infections requiring no antibiotics [P-16]. It introduces an unverifiable 'knowledge graph' claim not in Gold or transcript, which is a factual error. Core facts are accurate, but discrepancies exist.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies [P-36], no prescribed meds [P-36]. Missed: no treatments for current wheezing episodes [P-33, P-34], reaffirmations of no regular meds [P-46, P-47], past infections no antibiotics [D-16, P-16]. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine/OTC for allergies and no prescribed meds are directly verifiable [P-36]. 'Knowledge graph' reference is hallucinated, not in transcript. Minor issue with 'patient reported her daughter' (mother speaking). Some unverifiable details but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists medications (Reactine for allergies) and confirms no prescribed, addressing question on current/other conditions and prescriptions. Implicitly covers no current respiratory meds by omission, but focused; minor irrelevance from 'knowledge graph'."
