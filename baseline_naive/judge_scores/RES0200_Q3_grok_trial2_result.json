  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer identifies three specific symptoms (worsening cough with details from P-1/P-5, sputum changes from P-6, increased dyspnea from P-8) plus COPD history (P-2/P-11) leading to diagnosis, linked explicitly in D-52. Generated Answer correctly identifies worsening cough and increased dyspnea with partial citations (P-1, D-52) and COPD history linkage, but completely omits sputum changes (a cardinal symptom per Gold and question), underrepresenting the combination. Doctor's D-52 quote matches but Generated presents only two symptoms as 'the specific combination,' discrepant with Gold's three. Main point of worsening symptoms + COPD = exacerbation is correct, but significant omission of one key symptom makes it partially accurate. Score: 3.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) worsening cough details/cites (P-1,P-5), 2) sputum change detail/cite (P-6), 3) dyspnea details/cite (P-8), 4) COPD history details/cites (P-2,P-11), 5) doctor's synthesis/linkage (D-52 quote/details). Covered: 1 (briefly), 3 (briefly), 4 (briefly), 5 (partially). Missed: 2 entirely, detailed descriptions/cites for all. Covers ~60% of key points (two of three symptoms + linkage/history). Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated verifiable in transcript: symptoms reported in P-1, confirmed/worsened in D-52; COPD history referenced there. Citations [P-1],[D-52] accurate and directly support claims. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; sputum omitted but not fabricated. Fully grounded. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly identifies symptom combination (worsening cough + dyspnea), ties to COPD history, quotes doctor's linkage from D-52, structured to answer question precisely with no off-topic content. Perfectly focused despite omission. Score: 5"
