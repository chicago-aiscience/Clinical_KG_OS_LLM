  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states 'The transcript does not contain any information regarding a specific medication the patient had tried prior to the visit,' when in fact the patient explicitly mentions trying decongestants in [P-10]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies this. The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol Cold as the recommended medication, but completely misses the patient's assessment of the decongestant's effectiveness ('worked a little bit'). This is a major omission of a key fact directly stated in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses only 2 of 3 required components and does so incompletely. It fails to identify the prior medication (decongestants), misses the patient's actual assessment of effectiveness ('worked a little bit'), and only partially covers the doctor's recommendations (mentions Tylenol Cold but omits staying hydrated, the timeline of 'a few weeks' for resolution, and the context about supportive care for viral infections). Coverage is approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a critical unfaithful claim by stating no medication information exists in the transcript when [P-10] clearly documents the patient tried decongestants. This is a direct contradiction of verifiable transcript content. The statement about 'doesn't seem to be getting any better' is taken from [P-1] but misapplied to answer a question about medication effectiveness rather than overall symptom trajectory. The Tylenol Cold recommendation is accurately cited from [D-39].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address all three parts of the question (prior medication, effectiveness assessment, and doctor's recommendation) but provides incorrect or incomplete information for each component. The structure is relevant to the question format, but the content fails to properly answer what was asked, particularly regarding the prior medication trial and its effectiveness."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. Most critically, it incorrectly claims no prior medication information exists in the transcript, when the patient clearly states trying decongestants in [P-10]. This represents both a factual error and a faithfulness issue. The answer also fails to capture the patient's nuanced assessment of the decongestant's effectiveness ('worked a little bit') and provides only partial coverage of the doctor's recommendations, omitting important details about hydration, timeline, and supportive care context. While the answer attempts to address the question's structure, the substantial inaccuracies and omissions result in a below-average evaluation."
