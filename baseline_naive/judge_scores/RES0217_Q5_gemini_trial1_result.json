  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the duration reasoning (72+ hours based on Friday/Saturday activities) but incorrectly claims that the transcript does not mention Strathroy or the Lyme disease distribution map. These details are clearly present in segments [D-12], [P-12], and [D-13] of the provided transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer only covers the first half of the prompt regarding the attachment duration. It fails to answer the second half of the question regarding geographic risk and the Ontario map, incorrectly stating that this information is missing.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on faithfulness by claiming information is absent from the transcript when it is explicitly there. It misidentifies the segments provided ([D-5], [D-6], [D-17]) as the only relevant ones, whereas [D-13] contains the key map information.",
    "relevance": "The response is partially relevant as it addresses the first part of the question. However, the second half of the response is a meta-discussion about the supposed absence of information rather than an answer to the clinical question."
