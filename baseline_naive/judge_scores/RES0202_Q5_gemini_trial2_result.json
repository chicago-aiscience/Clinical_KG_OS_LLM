  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the school as the suspected source of illness due to symptoms starting after school on Wednesday, the mother's concern about COVID-19 at school, and the lack of sick contacts outside the school environment.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but omits a few nuances present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it misses the detail regarding the school's requirement for a COVID test result to return so they can notify other families of potential exposure (P-41). It also omits the context that other sources (travel and home environment) were ruled out, which further emphasizes school as the likely source.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using direct quotes and appropriate citations. It accurately reflects the mother's uncertainty about sick contacts at school versus her certainty about lack of contacts outside school.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and exclusively addresses the components of the question: school attendance as a factor, sick contacts (school vs. outside), and school notifications."
