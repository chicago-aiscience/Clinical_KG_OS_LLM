  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error in its summary, stating that hay fever is being controlled through dietary changes, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer clearly state the diet is for acid reflux. It also fails to explicitly state the clinical link between acid reflux and persistent cough, which is a core point in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key clinical connections provided in the Gold Answer: it does not mention that reflux is a recognized contributor to cough, that hay fever suggests airway sensitivity, or that the occupational role represents an increased risk for infectious exposure. It focuses more on the social impact of the cough at work rather than the clinical risk associated with the profession.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a link between hay fever and dietary management in the final paragraph. While most other details are grounded in the transcript, this misattribution is a notable lapse in faithfulness to the source text.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant as it structures itself around the three specific components requested in the prompt (reflux, hay fever, and occupation) and addresses the persistent nature of the cough."
