  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the content of the transcript. It explicitly states that information regarding the duration of the cough (4-5 days), the timing of the runny nose (past couple of days), the change in severity (stayed the same), and the comparison to prior experiences (never had a dry cough like this, previous runny noses were shorter) is missing from the transcript, when all of these points are clearly present in the provided text.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the 4-5 day duration for the cough, the 2-day duration for the runny nose, the stability of the cough severity, and the specific historical comparisons provided by the patient in P-24.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer demonstrates a significant failure in grounding. It hallucinates the absence of information that is explicitly stated in the transcript (e.g., claiming there is no mention of severity changes when P-7 clearly addresses this).",
    "relevance": "While the answer is structured to address the components of the question, it fails to provide any of the requested information, instead offering incorrect negative assertions that the data is unavailable."
