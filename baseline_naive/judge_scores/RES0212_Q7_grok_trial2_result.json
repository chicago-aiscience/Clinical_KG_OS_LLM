  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states the initial onset of the cough as approximately one month ago, citing [P-19] and [P-21] which refer to sleep disruption duration, not onset; the Gold Answer and transcript [P-2, P-13] clearly indicate three months for onset. It omits the intermittent dry nature for two months and misplaces the productive sputum timeline (three days ago per [P-12], not specified). Sleep disruption timing matches Gold (one month). It erroneously claims no mention of subjective fevers despite [P-4] describing feeling hot at night in the past couple days. These are significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3-month onset [P-2,P-13], 2 months dry intermittent [P-2], 1-month sleep disruption [P-19,P-21], 3-day productive greenish sputum [P-2,P-9,P-12], couple days subjective fevers [P-4], doctor's summary [D-47]. Generated covers sleep disruption (1 month) partially and sputum description but misses onset (says 1 month instead of 3), intermittent phase, exact productive timing, fevers entirely, and summary; covers ~25-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims of 1-month onset misinterpret [P-19,P-21] (sleep-related, not onset; transcript has 3-month cough [P-2]); productive sputum verifiable [P-9] but timeline ungrounded (ignores [P-12]); sleep accurate; fevers hallucinated as absent despite direct transcript evidence [P-4 'feeling like hot at night in the past couple days']. Multiple misinterpretations and omissions indicate poor grounding.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response as a bullet-point timeline directly addressing onset, sleep, productivity, and fevers as per question, with no off-topic content, though inaccurate; highly focused on query elements."
