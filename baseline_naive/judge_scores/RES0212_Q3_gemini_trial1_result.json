  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as pneumonia/LRTI. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating that the transcript 'does not explicitly contain the word \"fever\"' and that the patient does not report it. In reality, the doctor explicitly asks about fevers in [D-4] and the patient describes feeling 'hot at night' in [P-4], which is the definition of a subjective fever. The generated answer uses 'fatigue' and 'sleep' from [P-19] as a substitute for fever evidence, which is clinically inaccurate in this context compared to the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the three requested clinical features but misses key context provided in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the chronicity of the cough (the 3-month history) which is crucial for the 'acute-on-chronic' diagnosis mentioned in the Gold Answer. It also lacks the mention of negative findings (lack of weight loss or night sweats) used to refine the diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails faithfulness by claiming the transcript lacks the word 'fever' (it appears in [D-4]) and by ignoring the direct evidence of subjective fever in [P-4] ('feeling like hot at night'). It instead attributes the 'subjective fever' section to tiredness and poor sleep [P-19], which is a hallucination of the relationship between those symptoms and the specific prompt requirement.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant as it follows the structure of the prompt, addressing the diagnosis and the three specific features requested."
