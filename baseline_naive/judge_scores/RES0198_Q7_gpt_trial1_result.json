  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the symptoms began about one week prior and were not improving. However, it contains major factual errors versus the Gold Answer/transcript: (1) it claims the transcript does not specify which symptom appeared first, but the patient clearly states it was “pretty stuffy at first” [P-3]; (2) it denies any shift in predominant symptom, but the patient explicitly says “now it’s mostly running” [P-3]; (3) it concludes the symptoms were intermittent rather than constant, contradicting the patient’s clarification that symptoms were “pretty constant for the past week” [P-8]. It also incorrectly ties “a little bit” to nasal discharge/consistency—“a little bit” refers to fatigue [P-15].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: ~1 week duration; lack of improvement. Key elements missed or contradicted: congestion first; progression from congestion to rhinorrhea; reconciliation of initial “on and off” with later “pretty constant”; possible influence of decongestants on symptom change. Overall coverage is well under full and includes contradictions of central points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not faithful to the transcript: it says order is unspecified (contradicted by [P-3]); says no shift in predominance (contradicted by [P-3]); asserts intermittent pattern as the final characterization (contradicted by [P-8]); and misattributes “a little bit” to discharge/consistency (hallucinated/miscited from [P-15]).",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on the requested timeline (first symptom, change over the week, constant vs intermittent), but it answers these components incorrectly and introduces irrelevant/misinterpreted detail about discharge."
