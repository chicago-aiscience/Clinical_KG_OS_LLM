  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain the clinical findings or symptoms the patient does not exhibit during physical activity. Turn [P-28] in the provided transcript explicitly lists 'short of breath', 'wheezing', and notes these are absent 'even with physical activity'.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide the specific clinical findings requested in the second half of the question (shortness of breath, wheezing, absence during physical activity), claiming the information is missing.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is not present in the source text when it is clearly stated in turn [P-28]. It attributes its identification of asthma to a 'Knowledge Graph' rather than the transcript itself.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant; it identifies the condition but refuses to answer the second part of the query based on a false premise that the data is missing from the source text."
