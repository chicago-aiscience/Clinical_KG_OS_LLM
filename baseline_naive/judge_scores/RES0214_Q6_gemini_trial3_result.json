  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly correct but contains a minor discrepancy regarding 'next steps'. It identifies the COVID-19 swab and self-isolation correctly. However, it lists asking about the flu shot as a concluding 'next step', whereas in the transcript, this was a clinical question asked during the encounter. The actual immediate next steps mentioned in the transcript and gold answer were the physical examination and the clinician consulting with the supervising doctor.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers about 50-60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It successfully identifies the test (COVID swab) and the precautionary measures (self-isolation for both). However, it completely misses two critical components of the management plan: the immediate next step of a physical exam and the plan to consult the supervising physician before returning.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript. All claims, including the mention of the flu shot and the swab/isolation, are directly supported by the text. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses each part of the user's multi-part question, although its content for the 'next steps' portion is less comprehensive than the Gold Answer."
