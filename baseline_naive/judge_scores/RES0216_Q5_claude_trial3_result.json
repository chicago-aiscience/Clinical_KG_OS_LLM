  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states the patient skipped their 'evening dose of their maintenance inhaler,' but does NOT mention this was a self-directed decision to reduce from twice-daily to once-daily dosing [P-19]. The answer correctly identifies the failure to refill the rescue inhaler and the asthma history. However, it incorrectly references a 'Knowledge Graph' multiple times ([KG] citations), which does not exist in the source transcript. The core relationship between medication changes and symptom recurrence is captured, but with less precision than the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions: (1) asthma history, (2) failure to refill rescue inhaler for years, (3) symptoms consistent with asthma recurrence, and (4) lack of rescue medication during symptoms. However, it MISSES critical details: the specific twice-daily to once-daily reduction of maintenance inhaler [P-19], the patient's reasoning ('didn't feel needing it') [P-19-P-20], the doctor's explicit D-34 summary connecting these factors, the specific symptom characteristics (diffuse, worsened by exertion/deep breathing), and the patient noting symptoms feel 'different' [P-16]. The Gold Answer's depth regarding the self-directed nature of both medication changes is not fully captured.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains multiple hallucinations. It repeatedly cites a 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' that does not exist in the transcript (appears 8+ times). Phrases like 'the Knowledge Graph identifies,' 'Knowledge Graph links,' are fabricated. While the clinical facts about asthma history, rescue inhaler non-refill, and symptom recurrence ARE grounded in the transcript, the KG citations represent significant hallucinated content. The actual clinical connections made are verifiable (P-16, P-17, P-19), but the attribution mechanism is invented. Approximately 30-40% of the answer consists of or relies on these fabricated KG references.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about how asthma history, medication decisions (skipping evening dose, not refilling rescue inhaler), and new symptoms relate. The structure follows the question's logic: establishing asthma history, documenting medication changes, and connecting these to current symptoms. However, the extensive KG references add irrelevant distraction. The core clinical reasoning is on-topic, but presentation suffers from these tangential fabrications. About 70% of content is directly relevant to the specific question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer captures the basic clinical relationship between the patient's asthma history, medication non-compliance (not refilling rescue inhaler), and symptom recurrence, earning moderate correctness and completeness scores. However, it suffers from significant faithfulness issues due to repeated citations of a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph,' which constitutes hallucinated content appearing throughout the response. While the core clinical facts are grounded in the transcript, the attribution mechanism is fabricated. The answer also lacks important details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific self-directed reduction from twice-daily to once-daily maintenance inhaler dosing and the doctor's D-34 summary explicitly connecting these factors. The relevance is reasonable but diminished by the distracting KG references. Overall, this represents a partially accurate response significantly undermined by systematic hallucination."
