  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors and omissions compared to the Gold Answer. It fails to mention that symptoms have been 'staying the same' (explicitly stated in P-2, P-3), incorrectly states the transcript doesn't mention symptom progression, and omits critical information about the patient reducing walks from multiple to one per day (P-22). It also fails to mention other exacerbating factors like getting up from a chair and taking deep breaths (P-9).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: initial onset during a walk (P-4), three-day timeline, walking as an exacerbating factor, and impact on daily routine. However, it completely misses: the 'staying the same' progression statement, the baseline 'always there' quality of symptoms, specific reduction from multiple walks to one walk daily, other exacerbating factors (chair, deep breaths), work impact assessment, and the functional impact discussion between patient and doctor.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it makes one significant error by claiming 'The transcript does not explicitly state whether the symptoms have improved, worsened, or remained static' when P-2 clearly shows the doctor asking this question and the patient responding 'I think it's staying the same.' This represents a failure to accurately represent information present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses most aspects of the question including symptom development, triggering activity, exacerbating factors, and impact on walking routine. However, it provides incomplete coverage of the evolution aspect and functional impact details that were specifically requested in the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a partially adequate response that addresses the main question components but contains significant gaps in completeness and correctness. It correctly identifies the three-day timeline, initial onset during walking, and exacerbating factors, but critically fails to mention the explicitly stated 'staying the same' progression (P-2) and omits important details about reducing walks from multiple to one daily (P-22). The answer also misses other exacerbating factors like getting up from chairs and taking deep breaths. While mostly grounded in the transcript, it incorrectly claims information about symptom progression is absent when it was directly stated. The response addresses the question's core elements but lacks the thoroughness and accuracy expected for clinical documentation."
