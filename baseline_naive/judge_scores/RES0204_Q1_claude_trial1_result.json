  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main respiratory symptoms (dry/non-productive cough and runny nose) and accurately characterizes the cough as non-productive. However, it fails to provide the complete characterization of the nasal discharge. The Gold Answer specifies the discharge was 'pretty clear' [P-12], but the Generated Answer only mentions that characteristics 'were being assessed' without providing the actual answer given by the patient. This is a factual omission.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main symptoms but is significantly incomplete. It lacks: (1) the specific timeline (4-5 days for cough, couple of days for runny nose), (2) the actual description of nasal discharge as 'pretty clear', (3) that the cough stayed the same in severity, (4) pertinent negatives (no sore throat, chest pain, wheezing, shortness of breath), and (5) patient's statement about never having a dry cough like this before. It covers approximately 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is largely faithful to the transcript. The characterization of the cough as dry/non-productive is accurate and cited correctly [D-5]. However, the statement that nasal discharge characteristics 'were being assessed' is misleading - while the doctor did ask about it [D-11, D-12], the patient actually provided an answer ('It's pretty clear' [P-12]) that should have been included. The answer doesn't hallucinate facts but fails to extract information that was clearly provided.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about respiratory symptoms and their characteristics. It focuses on the two main symptoms (cough and runny nose) and attempts to describe their nature. However, it could be more complete in answering what was specifically asked about the 'appearance of the nasal discharge' by providing the patient's actual response rather than noting it was being assessed."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main respiratory symptoms (dry cough and runny nose) but provides incomplete information. While it accurately characterizes the cough as non-productive with proper citation, it fails to include the patient's description of the nasal discharge as 'pretty clear' and omits important details like timelines, symptom progression, and pertinent negatives. The answer is largely faithful to the transcript but misses key information that was explicitly provided by the patient."
