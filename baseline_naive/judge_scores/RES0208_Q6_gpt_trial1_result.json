  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on the core plan: chest exam/physical exam, chest X-ray, COVID swab, isolate from everyone including wife if discharged, results in 24–48 hours, and disposition based on results. A minor inaccuracy is that it implies a public health nurse would contact the patient if they go home (generally), whereas the transcript/Gold specify the public health nurse would advise what to do if results are positive. It also adds a non-transcript statement about a “knowledge graph,” though this does not change the clinical plan.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) planned chest-focused physical exam, (2) chest X-ray, (3) COVID swab, (4) self-isolation away from everyone including wife if discharged, (5) 24–48 hour result timeline, (6) public health nurse role, and (7) admission vs discharge contingent on test results. Minor gap: does not clearly preserve the Gold’s condition that public health nurse instruction is specifically if the test is positive; also does not explicitly note that no numeric thresholds were provided (though it does not invent any).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by [D-37]. However, the mention of a “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript and is therefore an ungrounded addition. The public-health-nurse contact is slightly overgeneralized beyond the transcript’s ‘if positive’ framing.",
    "relevance": "The response is well-focused on the requested management-plan components (tests, physical exam, isolation instructions and from whom, timeline, and admission vs discharge criteria). Minor irrelevant content appears in the ‘knowledge graph’ sentence."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer and covers nearly all requested plan elements, with minor overgeneralization about public health nurse follow-up and a small ungrounded ‘knowledge graph’ addition."
