  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fully matches the Gold Answer in factual content: assessment that symptoms align with COVID-19 (with accurate symptom examples from transcript), exact diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray with matching paraphrases), and precise isolation instructions (until results and continued if symptomatic even if negative). No discrepancies or errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers 100% of Gold Answer key points: assessment [D-43], COVID swab and chest X-ray tests [D-43], isolation until results [D-43], continued isolation if symptomatic post-negative test [D-43]. Minor Gold details like COPD/breathing context, consulting physician, and patient acknowledgment are absent but not core to the question's specified elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-43] for assessment, tests, and isolation; listed symptoms (sore throat, swallowing issues, aches, fatigue) match patient reports [P-2, P-25]; chest X-ray paraphrase grounded in 'get an idea of what's going on in there'; accurate citations; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around overall assessment, management plan with specific tests, isolation instructions, and exact conditions for continued isolation; no off-topic content."
