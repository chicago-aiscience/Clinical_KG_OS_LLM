  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for high cholesterol with accurate citations [P-25, P-26], consistent with Gold. However, it incorrectly states no over-the-counter medications are taken, directly contradicting the transcript and Gold where patient reports taking Tylenol [P-14] for symptoms with partial effectiveness ('helps a little bit'). Reference to a 'knowledge graph' is not present in the provided transcript or Gold, introducing an unverified element. This represents significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Lipitor for cholesterol [covered]; (2) only medication confirmed [partially implied]; (3) Tylenol OTC for fever/symptoms, effectiveness 'helps a little bit' [missed entirely]; (4) no other meds; (5) non-medication relief noted [not covered]; (6) additional context like no allergies. Covers only ~25% (prescribed med), misses all OTC and effectiveness, which are central to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Lipitor claims verifiable in [P-25, P-26]. OTC denial not grounded—directly contradicts [P-14] 'I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit.' Knowledge graph reference hallucinated (absent from transcript). Symptom citations [P-15,17,19] accurate but misused to deny OTC use. Multiple ungrounded claims (absence of OTC, external graph).",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around prescribed/OTC meds, conditions, but fails on OTC/effectiveness part of question. Knowledge graph note is minor tangent, but overall focused on query."
