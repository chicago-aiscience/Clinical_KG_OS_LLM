  "full_text": " So what brings you into the clinic today? Hi. So I've just, like, for, I don't know, like three or four days, I've been having a huge ride off and broke the skulls with the cracky. I just feel kind of crappy overall. I think my head's pounding. Yeah. Your head's pounding. Do you have a headache right now? Yeah, a little bit. I just kind of feel just, like, you. OK. And you say you've been feeling that for three to four days now? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. What did you first notice? I first noticed that my throat was kind of scratchy and then I started coughing, but it's really like dry. OK. So you haven't been bringing anything up with it? No. You can just flam? No, nothing. OK. You haven't been noticing it been running a temperature at home, have you? Hot favors. I have felt really hot. You felt hot at home? OK. Yeah. You've noticed any night sweats? By night sweats, I mean, you wake up, sheets are soaked. Uh, honestly, I felt hot, like, all the time. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, night I feel hot. During the day, too, I'm just like, I'm, I'm like, take, I'm wearing like just shorts and like a tank top and I just still feel really hot. OK. You know, I say skin changes, anything in your arms or legs, it looks weird, new rashes. I don't, I don't think so. I haven't really been looking, but, you know, I'm worries. And then aside from that, any nausea, any vomiting? No, not that. No, nothing like that, any diarrhea? No, no. Any aches in your joints anywhere? No, I mean, I'm tired, but I don't think they're not like hurting. OK. So aside from kind of this dry, cough feeling hot, that otherwise, you're feeling OK. You don't have any other real concerns aside from that. Yeah, just like, I just feel crappy. Like, OK. I really, I don't think, I know that's not like a, a real like way to say. I don't know, I know it, it's perfectly valid. We call it that malaise. And just speaking a little bit off. All right, so let's go talk about you for a little bit. But first, we'll get to that later. So any issues that you've seen a doctor for before? I have allergies usually in like the spring and the fall. Do you have any allergies to any medications? No, no, nothing like that. It's just like, again, really bad allergies. Like, I've seen an allergist. And some years I've gotten allergy shots, but like, not every year. Otherwise, I'll take the like, and clarify. This is like, this is maybe around, like, this is just before they normally start. So I don't really have them right now. OK. Probably like in a few weeks, they'd be really bad. Now, do any of these allergies make it difficult to breathe? Or do you feel like your face is swelling up? Like, it feels like a little bit plugged up. And like, what's that called like post nasal drip? But I don't really feel like I can't breathe. It's just like a little stuffy, eh? Yeah, exactly. And these shots of the allergies gave you. How often would you get those? Those are the ones that I'd have like once, usually like once a week for a little while, like in the winter before. OK. So you don't carry an happy pan with you? No, no, they said it's not like one of those allergies. It's just like, it's just like the seasonal ones, but they're just bad. OK. Sounds good. So you've seen an allergist. Any other doctors that you've seen in your life? Just like my family doctor. I don't really go very often. OK. Has there any health issues that you've had in the past? No. Like, I've been really healthy. It's just like the allergies and. OK. Any surgeries in your life? No. No. No? Are you taking any medications right now? Like, I take clarin for allergies, but I haven't like right now. I just like have it with me. I take route for control. What type of birth control do you take? In Deo. OK. And do you take that regularly? Yeah, it's just like the pill. It's like the one that goes for three months. Mm-hmm. OK. So you don't have NAUD just take the oral contraception? Yeah. Yeah, just the pill. God, I've got it. OK. And then, so you've never had asthma in your life, eh? No. OK. Any family history of asthma? Like my cousin. OK. What about your parents, brothers, sisters? No. Nothing like that? Do you know what exemis? Like, I've heard of it. OK. Anyone in the family have it? No. Like, the only thing like my dad has allergies too. OK. Kind of me. Dad has allergies. OK. Mother and father still alive? Yeah. Healthy? Yeah. OK. Good. OK. Do you live with them right now? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm in high school. OK. See, you live in a house with both your parents? OK. Any brother, sisters? Yeah, I have a little brother. So we'll see. It's like 14 now? OK. Has anyone in the family been sick recently? Uh, I think my brother, we had like a cold. He had a cold? Yeah. OK. But like we are doing our school from home now. So, like my mom works from home and my dad just works like on the farm. So no one's been like seeing anyone or going anywhere to get sick. OK. So sorry. Do you live on a farm? Yeah. OK. In London? Like just outside. OK. Any travel anywhere recently? No. Like I just came here. But like I don't really leave the house. So last two weeks, you haven't left the country? No. I like that. I wish. I don't know. Or is. You keep any animals on the farm? We have like a dog, but it's not like an animal farm. Got it. OK. And other questions? Are you sexually active? Uh, no. Well, you're taking the birth control? OK. So what was your last menstrual period? Um, like, uh, like I just got done like a week ago. A week ago? Mm-hmm. And you haven't been sexually active since then? No. OK. So the chance you've been pregnant is very low. Oh, yeah. I have. Like, yeah, I, it's been like a year. Got it. Got it. All right. Do you smoke cigarettes? No. Oh. Do you drink alcohol at all? Like before COVID, when I saw my friends, like, sometimes a little bit, but like, not really anymore. OK. How much would you drink when you went out? Oh, like, I mean, our parents would sometimes let us have like a couple of coolers, but like, OK. That was it. Got it. Any other drugs? Marijuana, cocaine. Like I tried marijuana once at a party, like a couple years ago. But like, I had, I had never did it again. Got it. So no, none of the harder drugs, cocaine, heroin? No. And I got to ask this question for everyone. Have you ever injected drugs or anything into your arm or your body? No. OK. All right. Thanks, Jessica. So just to summarize, you kind of had a three to four day dry cough with a little bit of fever, some headache. And just in terms, this quickly reviewing, then. So you haven't been bringing anything up. No one in contact with you has recently been sick. You don't have as many. You're not taking any medications aside from Claretin. And your little brother might have been sick about two weeks ago with kind of a common cold. And what we're hoping to get out of this visit is just to kind of next steps in order to go from here correct. Yeah. Like, I just want to know if I have to like take medicine or something. OK. All right. Perfect. Thank you very much. I'll do you have any more questions? No, I don't know. I don't have any more questions. I just like, if I can go home soon, you might go down. Sounds good. Thanks, Jessica.",
