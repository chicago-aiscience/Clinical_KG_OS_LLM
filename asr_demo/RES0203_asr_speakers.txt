[D-1] Have you wanted to tell me what grant you in today?
[P-1] Yeah, so for the past two days, I've noticed that I can't smell things as well as I used to be able to smell them.
[D-2] And I seem to have lost my sense of taste as well.
[P-2] And I have this mild dry cough.
[D-3] I'm just worried it's COVID.
[P-3] Okay, you said for a couple days.
[D-4] Yes, for two days.
[P-4] Okay.
[D-5] Okay. Have you ever had anything like this before?
[P-5] No, no, nothing like this.
[D-6] Okay. When you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone?
[P-6] Or if you taste a little bit, or how is that working for you?
[D-7] The smell isn't totally gone. I can still smell something if it smells really, really bad.
[P-7] And then I can taste really, really salty foods, but I can't taste normal things.
[D-8] Like I can't taste the banana.
[P-8] Okay.
[D-9] Has that been pretty consistent throughout the last couple of days? Or is it on and off?
[P-9] It's been pretty consistent, yeah.
[D-10] Okay.
[P-10] Does this dry cough, does that start at the same time?
[D-11] Yes.
[P-11] Okay. And when you say, or sorry, you said mild cough.
[D-12] And my next question was, do you feel like it's a dry cough?
[P-12] Are you producing any fudum, any blood, or is it not bringing up anything?
[D-13] It's dry.
[P-13] Okay.
[D-14] Okay. Has that gotten worse over the last couple of days?
[P-14] The dry cough.
[D-15] It's been pretty consistent as well.
[P-15] Okay.
[D-16] Is there anything to try to make it better? Have you taken any over the counter medications?
[P-16] No, I haven't tried anything.
[D-17] Okay.
[P-17] Okay.
[D-18] Have you had, in addition to these symptoms, have you had any fever?
[P-18] Fever is no fever.
[D-19] Okay.
[P-19] Any difficulty breathing?
[D-20] No.
[P-20] Okay.
[D-21] Any headaches?
[P-21] No, no headaches.
[D-22] Okay.
[P-22] Any sore throat?
[D-23] No.
[P-23] Okay. And we chill their night fun?
[D-24] No.
[P-24] Okay. Any in muscle aches or general weaknesses?
[D-25] I know.
[P-25] Okay.
[D-26] So generally, it seems like it's pretty well other than this loss of case flushed out and the dry cough.
[P-26] Is that correct?
[D-27] Yes.
[P-27] Okay.
[D-28] And then recently, have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick?
[P-28] No. Not that I can remember or...
[D-29] Yeah. Not that I can't remember.
[P-29] Okay. Have you traveled anywhere?
[D-30] I went hiking with my partner two weeks ago.
[P-30] I guess there were some people who kind of brushed by us, but other than that, I don't see where else I could have gotten this from.
[D-31] Okay. Was that hiking somewhere close by?
[P-31] Yeah. It was like half an hour from where we are.
[D-32] Okay.
[P-32] Are immunizations up to date?
[D-33] Yes.
[P-33] Okay.
[D-34] And can you think of any... for this dry cough, just to circle back to that?
[P-34] Can you think of anything that triggers it?
[D-35] Like cold to cold or being around... things like cats or dogs?
[P-35] Or any other environmental thing?
[D-36] No.
[P-36] Okay.
[D-37] Okay.
[P-37] And...
[D-38] Have you had any test pain? That's the other thing. I'm not sure if I asked you.
[P-38] No. No test pain.
[D-39] Okay.
[P-39] Okay.
[D-40] And in terms of your general health, do you... do you have any chronic conditions that you live with?
[P-40] No. No.
[D-41] Okay.
[P-41] Do you take any medications?
[D-42] No.
[P-42] Okay.

[D-47] Okay.
[P-47] And just in terms of your lifestyle, do you live with family?
[D-48] No.
[P-48] Okay. Do you live with a lung, with a partner, or roommate?

[D-50] And then is that in town here?
[P-50] Yes.
[D-51] Okay.
[P-51] And in general, do you eat a healthy diet?

[P-52] Yeah, I think so.
[D-53] Do you smoke?
[P-53] No.
[D-54] Okay.
[P-54] Do you drink alcohol?
[D-55] No.
[P-55] I have drank alcohol before, but not regularly.
[D-56] Okay.
[P-56] And as you know, on a...
[D-57] I have taken edibles before, but also not regularly.
[P-57] Okay. Any other drugs?
[D-58] No.
[P-58] Okay. Are you currently in high school?
[D-59] Yes. I am in my last year of high school.
[P-59] Okay. Is that going?
[D-60] Pretty good. Yeah. We're doing things online now.
[P-60] Okay. So you haven't really been out of the house?
[D-61] No.
[P-61] Okay.
[D-62] Okay.
[P-62] I think that's all my questions for now.
[D-63] I definitely like to get you a COVID plus.
[P-63] Just to consider your symptoms are consistent with some home and COVID symptoms.
[D-64] So basically that means that we would do a swab.
[P-64] It might not come up for a day or two.
[D-65] You definitely have to self-isolate between now and when you get the results back,
[P-65] potentially even if it's negative longer, if you're still having symptoms.
[D-66] Yeah.
[P-66] Otherwise, there are probably...
[D-67] There might be a couple of other tests we want to do.
[P-67] We made up more questions when we come back.
[D-68] So I'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today,
[P-68] but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next.
[D-69] Did you have anything else you want to do, Tom?
[P-69] That I didn't ask you about or any questions.
[D-70] No. Thank you so much.
[P-70] Okay. Well, thanks for coming in today.
[D-71] We'll definitely be taking care of shortly.
[P-71] Thank you.
[D-72] Okay. Thank you.
