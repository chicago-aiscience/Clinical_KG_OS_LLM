[D-1] what brings you all in today.
[P-1] Hi.
[D-2] So I just flooded my son.
[P-2] So he's five.
[D-3] Essentially when he, uh,
[P-3] so to do, uh,
[D-4] when he got home from school and Wednesday,
[P-4] he seemed fine,
[D-5] but he,
[P-5] I don't know, that night he started to have a bit of like a car.
[D-6] I just seemed like a little dry cough,
[P-6] but obviously I just wanted to keep him home.
[D-7] Keep him safe and not like,
[P-7] if there anything if he was sick.
[D-8] So he stayed at home on Thursday and
[P-8] he was like having a bit of a cough.
[D-9] And then
[P-9] yesterday,
[D-10] it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired.
[P-10] Uh, sorry.
[D-11] Today, today is Friday.
[P-11] Um, he was like,
[D-12] his cough is like getting a bit worse.
[P-12] I've been taking his tent the whole time.
[D-13] And I got like a little high.
[P-13] Um, today,
[D-14] uh, what was it?
[P-14] My thermometer says it was high.
[D-15] I'm just like trying to remember.
[P-15] It was, it was, um,
[D-16] it was like over a hundred.
[P-16] So,
[D-17] uh, okay.
[P-17] A hundred and one or something,
[D-18] or maybe a hundred point one.
[P-18] If the anyways, it was, so I just thought I should probably bring him in
[D-19] because I was really worried about him and, you know,
[P-19] thought he could have maybe got COVID and get school or something.
[D-20] Yeah, for sure.
[P-20] Um, okay.
[D-21] So just to clarify,
[P-21] he's had this cough and fever for the past five,
[D-22] five days.
[P-22] Okay.
[D-23] Um, okay.
[P-23] So let's focus on the cough.
[D-24] Sorry.
[P-24] It's been more like three, three days, like one day, when he came home and then,
[D-25] um,
[P-25] and then today's Friday.
[D-26] So yeah, sorry.
[P-26] Today's Friday.
[D-27] Okay.
[P-27] Okay.
[D-28] Yep.
[P-28] Sure.
[D-29] Uh, so,
[P-29] is this cough a productive cough or is it kind of a dry cough?
[D-30] Uh,
[P-30] I think it's dry.
[D-31] I haven't noticed him like sitting.
[P-31] Not many think.
[D-32] Um,
[P-32] yeah, he's,
[D-33] yeah,
[P-33] it's been like little cough.
[D-34] Okay.
[P-34] And
[D-35] he is, he's not bringing up any sputum or blood.
[P-35] No.
[D-36] No.
[P-36] Okay, good.
[D-37] Okay.
[P-37] And does he sound easy at all to you?
[D-38] No.
[P-38] No, no, no, no.
[D-39] But I've noticed.
[P-39] Okay.
[D-40] How about short of breath?
[P-40] Um,
[D-41] I don't think so.
[P-41] Like he,
[D-42] usually he's a really active kid and he has, he hasn't been running,
[P-42] um,
[D-43] a lot outside in the past couple days.
[P-43] So maybe he,
[D-44] maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing, but also I think he's just been tired in general.
[P-44] Okay.
[D-45] Yeah.
[P-45] Okay.
[D-46] And
[P-46] is his coffin getting worse with certain times of the day?
[D-47] Like is it worse at night in the morning?
[P-47] I think it's kind of just there the whole day.
[D-48] Okay.
[P-48] And does it,
[D-49] how does it sound?
[P-49] Does it sound like a barkey cough?
[D-50] Does it sound
[P-50] um,
[D-51] a car?
[P-51] What is, what would you say the quality of his, of the sound of the coffees?
[D-52] Uh,
[P-52] I,
[D-53] just sounds kind of dry.
[P-53] It's not like super loud.
[D-54] Okay.
[P-54] Okay.
[D-55] And,
[P-55] have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?
[D-56] Uh, like he's had cold before, but I haven't, like I haven't,
[P-56] like he, this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than, you know,
[D-57] having a regular cold.
[P-57] Okay.
[D-58] And,
[P-58] are his symptoms getting worse?
[D-59] I,
[P-59] I think so, because yeah, the first day he just seemed like
[D-60] a little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he, like, actually has a fever.
[P-60] Okay.
[D-61] And,
[P-61] um, is he complaining of anything like chest pain,
[D-62] or feeling like his heart's racing?
[P-62] Uh, no, I don't think so.
[D-63] No, okay.
[P-63] Um, does he have a sore throat?
[D-64] Hmm.
[P-64] Uh, I don't think so.
[D-65] Okay.
[P-65] Um, is he having any issues following food or fluids?
[D-66] No, I don't know if he's having trouble slowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite
[P-66] right now.
[D-67] Okay.
[P-67] Um, and is he,
[D-68] um, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?
[P-68] Maybe a bit of like a, like a runny nose.
[D-69] Okay.
[P-69] And, does he have any issues with smell or taste?
[D-70] Uh, like this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast.
[P-70] And he's wondering if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit.
[D-71] Okay.
[P-71] Uh, have a vision or hearing?
[D-72] I think those are fine.
[P-72] Okay.
[D-73] And, is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?
[P-73] No.

[D-87] Yeah, he hasn't, like, decided to, like, a vaccine, and then he hasn't had to go to the doctor,
[P-87] like, ever, like, many of his broken arm bones, so that was it.
[D-88] Okay.
[P-88] Um, so, no past illnesses and, I guess, no hospitalizations or surgeries, except for the broken
[D-89] arm.
[P-89] Exactly.
[D-90] Like, nothing.
[P-90] Okay.
[D-91] And were things normal with your, uh, pregnancy with him?
[P-91] Yeah, totally.
[D-92] Okay.
[P-92] Um, and then have it as a newborn, any complications after birth?
[D-93] Um, no.
[P-93] No, like, everything is, and it's really good.
[D-94] Okay.
[P-94] And then did he hit all his milestones, um, up till now?
[D-95] Yeah, okay.
[P-95] Okay.
[D-96] Um, any, does he have any allergies?
[P-96] Um, no, no, thanks, though.
[D-97] I mean, like, he hasn't really taken a lot of medicines, so it's hard to say, but, like, nothing.
[P-97] So far.
[D-98] Is he up to date with all his immunizations?
[P-98] Yeah.
[D-99] Yeah, okay.
[P-99] And in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?
[D-100] Uh, no, everyone's really healthy.
[P-100] Okay.
[D-101] And, um, are there, and who does he live with and where does he live?
[P-101] Uh, he lives with me and I have learned, and he has a little sister like this in town here.
[D-102] Okay.
[P-102] And, uh, is she healthy?
[D-103] Yeah, like she is healthy.
[P-103] Okay.
[D-104] Um, any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos, or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?
[P-104] No.
[D-105] No, okay.
[P-105] Um, has he been around any said contacts recently?
[D-106] Not like outside of school.
[P-106] Like, we know for sure not outside of school, and that he goes to school right now.
[D-107] So, um, kind of hard to say.
[P-107] Okay.
[D-108] They haven't, they haven't like contacted us about anything.
[P-108] Okay, sure.
[D-109] Um, and has he traveled anywhere recently?
[P-109] No.
[D-110] No, okay.
[P-110] Okay.
[D-111] Well, those are all the questions I have for you today.
[P-111] Was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?
[D-112] I don't think so.
[P-112] Um, like I realized that like, oftentimes, like, you don't really do much.
[D-113] Um, for kids when, you know, when it's just like a virus or something.
[P-113] But we do, I guess, need to have a COVID test to go back to the school, even if, you know, either way,
[D-114] because they want us to be able to say it's like the other kids have had a, uh, an exosure.
[P-114] Yeah.
[D-115] Yeah.
[P-115] Like, all right, go ahead.
[D-116] No, go ahead.
[P-116] Um, so that's the thing.
[D-117] I'm not interested.
[P-117] I wanted to see if it was that.
[D-118] And I mean, he does receive her.
[P-118] So that's kind of what they make her in the kids.
[D-119] They're doing it a little bit.
[P-119] Right.
[D-120] Yeah.
[P-120] Okay.
[D-121] So first thing is first we need to do a COVID swap just to make sure that he either has it or doesn't have it.
[P-121] And those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours.
[D-122] And we do suggest because of symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolated for 14 days.
[P-122] And that includes from his, his younger sister, if possible.
[D-123] And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives, but also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays.
[P-123] Um, if his symptoms get worse, uh, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms,
[D-124] like seizures or, um, if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fating spells, uh, please do take him to the ER.
[P-124] And, um, so for now, we'll just wait for those COVID swaps to come back.
[D-125] How does that sound?
[P-125] Yeah, sounds good.
[D-126] Okay.
[P-126] Thank you.
[D-127] I know where he's, um, and I should have mentioned, um, if it was just the cough or if he was just sort of breath or something like that,
[P-127] and he didn't have the fever, we would add everything like asthma, um, to the list of things he could be worked up for.
[D-128] But, um, right now it sounds like a, it sounds like an infection.
[P-128] Okay. Yeah, that's good to know.
[D-129] All right. Sounds great. Have a good day.
[P-129] You too, thanks.
