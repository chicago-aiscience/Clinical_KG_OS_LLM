[D-1] I'm going to have a chat with you and get an idea of what's going on and then I can go
[P-1] over it with the stuff room we'll come back together and talk to you about the next step.
[D-2] And that's on to you.
[P-2] Sounds great. Thank you.
[D-3] Awesome. Okay, so it says here that you've been having a source row. Can you tell me a
[P-3] little bit more about that? Sure. Yeah, the source row, it started about four days ago.
[D-4] And it's really, it's very sore. I can drink fluids, okay, but I'm even having some issues
[P-4] swallowing food.
[D-5] Okay, so you said four days ago?
[P-5] Yes, four days ago.
[D-6] Okay, so it's been kind of sore, some issues swallowing food. Okay, and over the last four days
[P-6] has it gotten worse better? I'm going to stay the same.
[D-7] Um, the source row has got, it's getting worse for sure.
[P-7] Okay, I've never had anything like this before.
[D-8] Um, I guess when I was younger, I had mono and I had a source row when I had that, yeah.
[P-8] Okay, is there anything that makes it worse or really anything that makes it feel better right now?
[D-9] Um, no, not really. I've tried, you know, I've tried gargling with
[P-9] salt water, I've tried some painkillers, like nothing, nothing seems to be working.
[D-10] Okay, um, okay, and you said you've also had some difficulty breathing?
[P-10] Yes, that started around the same time?
[D-11] That actually started yesterday and it's gotten me very concerned.
[P-11] Okay, I can understand how that would be concerning. We're definitely going to try to get to the
[D-12] bottom of it today. Okay, so third yesterday, I said, then has it gotten any worse? Is it the same?
[P-12] It's getting worse? Yeah.
[D-13] Do you feel like it's all the time or is it on and off?
[P-13] Um, it's just there all the time.

[D-70] I think that's bad about, uh,
[P-70] coverage of my questions for you right now.
[D-71] Is there anything else that you wanted to add that I didn't ask you about?
[P-71] Um, no, I don't think so.
[D-72] Okay.
[P-72] Um, why am I going to go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today?
[D-73] Uh, I'm just in just because some of your symptoms are in line with, uh,
[P-73] common symptoms of COVID-19 that will probably get a COVID swab.
[D-74] Uh, and what happens with that is since you do have the symptoms,
[P-74] you'll have to isolate until the result come back.
[D-75] And, uh, potentially after that,
[P-75] if you still have symptoms, even if it is negative.
[D-76] Uh, so that's just kind of a heads up on that maybe one of the next things that happens.
[P-76] We will probably get you a chest X-ray because we want to get an idea of what's going on in there.
[D-77] Um, did you have any other questions?
[P-77] Um, no, thank you very much.
[D-78] Okay. Well, thanks for chatting with me.
[P-78] We should be back shortly to kind of let you know what the next step is.
[D-79] Okay. Great. Thank you.
[P-79] Thank you.
