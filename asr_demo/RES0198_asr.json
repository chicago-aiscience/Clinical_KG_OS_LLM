Any other symptoms like sore throat, shortness of breath, fever or chills? No. No, okay. And is this like something that's constant or does it come and go? It's been pretty constant for the past week. Okay. Has this happened to you before at all? No. Well, I've actually had a cold before, but not recently. Maybe like five years ago. Okay. Have you tried any over-the-counter medications at all? I've tried like e-congestants, and that's not, well, I guess my nose is running now, so that worked a little bit. Okay. Okay. And have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently? No, I don't think so. I have a nephew who I live with who goes to daycare. Okay. And has he been sick at all? No, he's been fine. Okay. Any recent travel? No. No. Okay. Any headaches or nausea or vomiting? No. Nothing like that. Okay. Any fatigue? A little bit. Okay. Any loss of sense of taste or smell? No. I'm not that I've noticed. Okay. Any sort of like chest pain or racing sensation or racing with your heart or anything like that? No. Okay. Any changes in your bowel movements? No. How about your any difficulties in urinating? I know. Okay. Have you been sleeping and eating well? Yes. Okay. Any away changes like any significant weight loss recently? No. Nothing like that. Okay. At home or at work, home any exposure to like fumes, dust or animals? No. Okay. And have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? I've type 1 diabetes. Okay. And when were you diagnosed with that? When I was like seven? Okay. And so you have your insulin medication and you're are you all up to date with that? Yes. Okay. And do you see an endocrinologist? I do. Okay. All right. Any medications that you're on besides insulin? No. No. Okay. Any allergies at all? No. Okay. Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries before? No. No? Okay.

And currently do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or anything? No. Not okay. So not frequently, but maybe like once a month, I'll have an edible. Okay. Any other recreational drugs like cocaine, heroin, anything like that? Oh, no. No. And do you drink alcohol? No. And do you smoke tobacco? No. Okay. Yeah. Those were all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me? Yeah. How do I get rid of this? It's really been bugging me. Yeah. Kind of. So just the stuffiness and the runny nose. It seems like it's most likely a viral infection like the common cold. It takes a few weeks for the symptoms to get relieved, but there's not much that we can do besides supportive care. So make sure you get you stay well hydrated. You can use over the counter medications like Tylenol cold. If you to relieve some of your symptoms, but since right now we're in a pandemic, some of these symptoms can also be seen in COVID patients. So we will also get a swab done for you today and you should have the results back by 48 hours. And until then, we recommend that you say isolated in your own home and not see anyone else. And then once the results come back, you'll get further instructions from public health. Okay. That sounds great. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care. You too.",
