  "full_text": " Yeah. So you're a 26 year old, generally healthy, and sorry, back pain. Chest pain. Chest pain. Okay. One of the chest pains start. So I guess I don't know if I'd really call it pain. It's been just very uncomfortable. Like it just felt a little odd for like a week and a half. Uh, it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of like a very sharp, strong pain, uh, when I take a deep breath. Um, but I don't notice it all the time. It's just, it's often when, um, I'm sitting and studying or when I'm walking, when I'm walking to school. Okay. Did you have any accidents or injuries around that time? Uh, no, nothing that I can think of. Okay. Did it come on suddenly? Or is it more crowded? Yeah. It's, uh, no, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty well. I think the same each time it's kind of last like 20 minutes or so. Um, and I've tried Tylenol and I've tried Advil, um, and I've even tried like, uh, like an alkyfeltzer and it hasn't really helped very much. Okay. So it's pretty, it's not consistent throughout the day. It only happens at certain times of the day. Yeah. It'll come on for like 20 minutes, like here and there. Okay. Anything that you think triggers it? I don't, I don't really know. Uh, I, I was kind of worried, um, I was kind of worried that it could be a heart thing. I, I feel like it might, it might be, like it could be stress. Um, but I'm not really sure. And my dad had a heart attack last year. He was pretty young. He's like, it is 50s and it, it just kind of scares me because now he's having these heart problems. Okay. So these chest pains last for about 20 minutes. It only happens when you take a deep breath in. And after the 20 minutes, do they come and go? Is it something that gradually weans off or is it fairly sharp? It seems like it kind of goes away once I, once I'm at school and like talking to people and doing other things. It's kind of when I'm, I notice it when I'm on my walks when I'm alone or like when I'm studying alone more. Like maybe I have it when I'm talking to other people, but I don't really notice it. Okay. Does it get worse with exercise? Uh, I don't think so. It just kind of like when I'm walking to school, it kind of stays the same. I haven't done any strenuous exercise lately because I've just had so much schoolwork piling up. So you mainly get it at, so you can get it at rest, I should say. Exactly. Yeah. Like when I'm studying. Okay. Any fevers sick at all last a little while? Uh, no, no, I don't think so. No, you can feel well otherwise. Yeah, I mean besides just kind of feeling stressed. I like, I, I've been trying to quit smoking and that's been, that's been kind of hard and schools just very, very busy right now. When did he stop smoking? Um, so like I guess I'm trying to quit. I'm smoking less than I used to. I probably smoked five cigarettes a day, but it used to be a little bit more. Okay. Coming back to the stress, is there anything recently that's causing you more worries? Um, it's just that I'm doing my masters of social work and I'm getting towards the end and it's just, it's very scary because I'm working on my final thesis. There's just a lot involved and it's just making me very nervous. Okay. Is there anything special about the last couple of weeks? Is it maybe more stress than previously? Uh, I think just the time crunch of having to finish this, I've never felt like so, like there's so little time to do the work that I need to do. Got it. Have you ever felt this pain before? Anytime in your life? No, no, not before this. Okay. So it comes on several times a day, not necessarily triggered by anything. And he said, you smoke, when did he start smoking? Um, like when I was probably 18, I sometimes smoked a little and then I smoked a little more, um, maybe like 10 cigarettes a day for, uh, like the last two years, but then a few months ago, I've been, I've been cutting it in half. Okay. Now, what do you get this, this chest pain? Do you ever feel short of breath? Um, I, I, I think I, I make myself nervous with it and then I kind of start breathing faster, but I don't have a hard, I don't have a hard time breathing otherwise. And it's hard to get a deep breath because I get, it makes me really nervous. Does your heart ever flutter? Feel like it's skipping a beat? Um, um, don't only if I, only if I, uh, like if I, if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack that felt like that before, but not any other time. Okay. Don't get chest pain. All right. And just in terms of other things, so anything else you've seen the doctor form in the past, you mentioned anxiety attacks. Yeah. Um, like I talked to my family doctor that that when I was a teenager, but I really, uh, haven't, you know, seen my doctor for it anytime in the last like eight years or so. Anything else you've seen your family? Oh, sorry. No, nothing else. I just, I, that I was kind of, when I was in high school, I, I had those and then I really happened for a long time, but, um, lately I felt like this, like I could maybe get them again. So you've never had asthma as a child? Uh, no. And you don't have asthma now? No. Okay. Do you take any medications right now? Uh, no, like I take like a multivitamin, but that's it. Okay. And you live in London? Mm-hmm. I do like her school. Got it. You lived during your master's in social work. Have anyone been around you been in sick at all last little while? No, like I live alone. I haven't really seen very many people lately. Okay. And how do you manage stress when you do get it? Um, I try to, I try to like set some time aside just to read books that like I like to read instead of like school book at nighttime. And, um, I do really enjoy running. It's, I've been a little bit nervous to do it lately, but usually I run like a few times a week. Okay. And when you're pretty preoccupied, do you ever get the chest pain? Um, like what I'm really, when I'm working, like working with classmates or, uh, like thinking really, like if I'm talking to someone else, I don't really get it. Or if I'm like working on a task with my hand, but it's when I'm walking and I, I'm alone kind of with my thoughts. They're when I'm studying. That's when I, when I get it. Understood. And you said your father passed early from a heart attack. I'm sorry, but anyone else in your family, other your parents or mom, having a lot of shoes. Uh, he's alive. Like he had a heart attack. Just now he has to see a lot of heart doctors. Um, no, there's nothing else in my family like that. I don't really know like about my grandpa, like my dad's dad, but like he might have also, um, he just kind of, he just passed away young from, um, like an accident. So yeah, I'm not really sure. Got it. So no one has died suddenly with no explanation when they were young or while they were swimming. No, no one's ever talking about a rhythm. Is that word familiar to you? No, no, just my dad and his heart attack. That's like the only thing I know of. Okay. Sounds good. I think I've got all the information I need and I'll pass it on to the doctor. We'll take a look at you. Okay. Have a good time. Okay. Thank you.",
