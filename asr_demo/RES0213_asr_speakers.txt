[D-1] Yeah. So you're a 26 year old, generally healthy, and sorry, back pain.
[P-1] Chest pain.
[D-2] Chest pain. Okay. One of the chest pains start.
[P-2] So I guess I don't know if I'd really call it pain. It's been just very
[D-3] uncomfortable. Like it just felt a little odd for like a week and a half.
[P-3] Uh, it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of like a very sharp, strong pain, uh, when I take a deep breath.
[D-4] Um, but I don't notice it all the time. It's just, it's often when, um, I'm sitting and
[P-4] studying or when I'm walking, when I'm walking to school.
[D-5] Okay. Did you have any accidents or injuries around that time?
[P-5] Uh, no, nothing that I can think of.
[D-6] Okay. Did it come on suddenly?
[P-6] Or is it more crowded? Yeah. It's, uh, no, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty well.
[D-7] I think the same each time it's kind of last like 20 minutes or so.
[P-7] Um, and I've tried Tylenol and I've tried Advil, um, and I've even tried like, uh,
[D-8] like an alkyfeltzer and it hasn't really helped very much.
[P-8] Okay. So it's pretty, it's not consistent throughout the day.
[D-9] It only happens at certain times of the day.
[P-9] Yeah. It'll come on for like 20 minutes, like here and there.
[D-10] Okay. Anything that you think triggers it?
[P-10] I don't, I don't really know. Uh, I, I was kind of worried, um,
[D-11] I was kind of worried that it could be a heart thing.
[P-11] I, I feel like it might, it might be, like it could be stress.
[D-12] Um, but I'm not really sure.
[P-12] And my dad had a heart attack last year.
[D-13] He was pretty young.
[P-13] He's like, it is 50s and it, it just kind of scares me because now he's having these heart problems.
[D-14] Okay. So these chest pains last for about 20 minutes.
[P-14] It only happens when you take a deep breath in.
[D-15] And after the 20 minutes, do they come and go?
[P-15] Is it something that gradually weans off or is it fairly sharp?
[D-16] It seems like it kind of goes away once I, once I'm at school and like talking to people and doing other things.
[P-16] It's kind of when I'm, I notice it when I'm on my walks when I'm alone or like when I'm studying alone more.
[D-17] Like maybe I have it when I'm talking to other people, but I don't really notice it.
[P-17] Okay. Does it get worse with exercise?
[D-18] Uh, I don't think so.
[P-18] It just kind of like when I'm walking to school, it kind of stays the same.
[D-19] I haven't done any strenuous exercise lately because I've just had so much schoolwork piling up.
[P-19] So you mainly get it at, so you can get it at rest, I should say.
[D-20] Exactly. Yeah.
[P-20] Like when I'm studying.
[D-21] Okay.
[P-21] Any fevers sick at all last a little while?
[D-22] Uh, no, no, I don't think so.
[P-22] No, you can feel well otherwise.
[D-23] Yeah, I mean besides just kind of feeling stressed.
[P-23] I like, I, I've been trying to quit smoking and that's been, that's been kind of hard and schools just very,
[D-24] very busy right now.
[P-24] When did he stop smoking?
[D-25] Um, so like I guess I'm trying to quit.
[P-25] I'm smoking less than I used to.
[D-26] I probably smoked five cigarettes a day, but it used to be a little bit more.
[P-26] Okay.
[D-27] Coming back to the stress, is there anything recently that's causing you more worries?
[P-27] Um, it's just that I'm doing my masters of social work and I'm getting towards the end and it's just,
[D-28] it's very scary because I'm working on my final thesis.
[P-28] There's just a lot involved and it's just making me very nervous.
[D-29] Okay.
[P-29] Is there anything special about the last couple of weeks?
[D-30] Is it maybe more stress than previously?
[P-30] Uh, I think just the time crunch of having to finish this, I've never felt like so,
[D-31] like there's so little time to do the work that I need to do.
[P-31] Got it.
[D-32] Have you ever felt this pain before?
[P-32] Anytime in your life?
[D-33] No, no, not before this.
[P-33] Okay.
[D-34] So it comes on several times a day, not necessarily triggered by anything.
[P-34] And he said, you smoke, when did he start smoking?
[D-35] Um, like when I was probably 18, I sometimes smoked a little and then I smoked a little more,
[P-35] um, maybe like 10 cigarettes a day for, uh, like the last two years, but then a few months ago,
[D-36] I've been, I've been cutting it in half.
[P-36] Okay.
[D-37] Now, what do you get this, this chest pain? Do you ever feel short of breath?
[P-37] Um, I, I, I think I, I make myself nervous with it and then I kind of start breathing faster,
[D-38] but I don't have a hard, I don't have a hard time breathing otherwise.
[P-38] And it's hard to get a deep breath because I get, it makes me really nervous.
[D-39] Does your heart ever flutter? Feel like it's skipping a beat?
[P-39] Um,
[D-40] um,
[P-40] don't only if I, only if I, uh,
[D-41] like if I, if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack that felt like that before, but not any other time.
[P-41] Okay.
[D-42] Don't get chest pain.
[P-42] All right.
[D-43] And just in terms of other things, so anything else you've seen the doctor form in the past,
[P-43] you mentioned anxiety attacks.
[D-44] Yeah. Um, like I talked to my family doctor that that when I was a teenager, but I really,
[P-44] uh, haven't, you know, seen my doctor for it anytime in the last like eight years or so.
[D-45] Anything else you've seen your family?
[P-45] Oh, sorry. No, nothing else. I just, I, that I was kind of, when I was in high school,
[D-46] I, I had those and then I really happened for a long time, but, um, lately I felt like this,
[P-46] like I could maybe get them again.
[D-47] So you've never had asthma as a child?
[P-47] Uh, no.
[D-48] And you don't have asthma now?
[P-48] No.
[D-49] Okay. Do you take any medications right now?
[P-49] Uh, no, like I take like a multivitamin, but that's it.
[D-50] Okay. And you live in London?
[P-50] Mm-hmm. I do like her school.
[D-51] Got it. You lived during your master's in social work.
[P-51] Have anyone been around you been in sick at all last little while?
[D-52] No, like I live alone. I haven't really seen very many people lately.
[P-52] Okay. And how do you manage stress when you do get it?
[D-53] Um, I try to, I try to like set some time aside just to read books that like I like to read instead of
[P-53] like school book at nighttime. And, um, I do really enjoy running.
[D-54] It's, I've been a little bit nervous to do it lately, but usually I run like a few times a week.
[P-54] Okay. And when you're pretty preoccupied, do you ever get the chest pain?
[D-55] Um, like what I'm really, when I'm working, like working with classmates or, uh,
[P-55] like thinking really, like if I'm talking to someone else, I don't really get it.
[D-56] Or if I'm like working on a task with my hand, but it's when I'm walking and I,
[P-56] I'm alone kind of with my thoughts. They're when I'm studying. That's when I, when I get it.
[D-57] Understood. And you said your father passed early from a heart attack. I'm sorry,
[P-57] but anyone else in your family, other your parents or mom,
[D-58] having a lot of shoes. Uh, he's alive. Like he had a heart attack. Just now he has to see a lot of heart
[P-58] doctors. Um, no, there's nothing else in my family like that. I don't really know like about
[D-59] my grandpa, like my dad's dad, but like he might have also, um, he just kind of, he just passed away
[P-59] young from, um, like an accident. So yeah, I'm not really sure. Got it. So no one has died suddenly
[D-60] with no explanation when they were young or while they were swimming. No, no one's ever talking
[P-60] about a rhythm. Is that word familiar to you? No, no, just my dad and his heart
[D-61] attack. That's like the only thing I know of. Okay. Sounds good. I think I've got all the
[P-61] information I need and I'll pass it on to the doctor. We'll take a look at you. Okay. Have a good
[D-62] time. Okay. Thank you.
