  "full_text": " What brings you in today? So I have COPD and it's usually pretty manageable with my coffers and that, but just in the last three days, I feel like it's gotten a lot worse. I feel like I'm coughing more often and I'm now producing more students. I have a green, yellowy and I'm not using it as a foodie. I even noticed that there was a little blood a couple times when I was like really coughing hard. I think it's harder to breathe than usual. I have home often, I don't think I was quite there yet, but these last few days it's been really hard to breathe. Okay, so what's this has happened in the past three days? Have your symptoms gotten better or worse over this time? I feel like they've been maybe getting a little worse. They definitely haven't gotten better. Okay, and has this ever happened to you before? I've had some troubles like when I've been sick before where the cough has gotten pretty bad. This is probably the worst that I've had, but I have had some mycio-bees that made worse by being sick. I see. Okay. Well, I guess the first thing we're going to do, how bad is your shortness of breath? I've had a walk here fine, but I normally can walk around the block and I go for a walk usually a couple times a day to walk my dog. It's been a little bit trickier to do that. I see. Okay. Have you ever had any cost liations in the past specifically for thecio-bees, exacerbations? I haven't stayed over in the hospital. I'd like come to emerge a couple times. How many times? I think twice. You'd be over the last like three years. When were you diagnosed with thecio-bees? You four or five years ago? Was it formally diagnosed using the proper testing? Yeah. They referred me to a lung doctor. I see. Okay. And how do you have any fevers or chills? I feel like I may have had a fever last night. I don't really want to. Do you check your temperature? I don't have a thermometer at home. I have no problem. We can check your temperature here. I would say I had a fever. Have you had any other symptoms? Have you had a runny nose or a steppe? No knee pain in your sinus? I think I've had a bit of a pressure in the sinus area. The cost has been the thing that's been the most bothersome. Have you had a sore throat at all? No. Okay. A headache? Maybe a little bit. Any nausea or vomiting? Any diarrhea or constipation? No. Downal pain? No. Okay. And have you recently lost weight unintentionally? No. No, I wish but no. Okay. Have you had any night sweats where you feel like you're branched in sweats at night? No. Nothing like that. And have you had any exposures to anyone who could potentially be sick? I think I meet my... I meet a couple of friends to walk our dogs together outside. And one of them was a bit sick for a bit. We try not to get too close but maybe... I don't know, maybe sometimes we walk a little too close. We feel too safe because we're like outside. Okay. And did your friend get a COVID test done? No. That's okay. But you mentioned that you had a COPD that was diagnosed four or five years ago. Any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with? Um... Yeah, I have a high blood pressure. Okay. And are you taking any medications? I'm not... I've been talked about it but I decided to try to change my lifestyle as much as I could first. And I've also done that for the COPD. It's generally... I've been really trying to take care of it but I feel like I maybe got sick or something this time. Yeah. So my blood pressure is like, okay right now. I've had my blood pressure and then I lost weight and started this walking more. That's great. That's really, really good that you're taking better care of yourself. You should definitely continue doing that. Right. Of course, yeah. And you've mentioned that you have some buffers. How often do you use those? Um, the one that I use every day. Um, that I'm supposed to just use no matter what. And then the one that I use when, uh, kind of just when I need it, I probably use it like once every two weeks. Okay. Um, and you mentioned that your COPD is getting better. And affecting your life in any way, affecting the way that you're doing your daily activities at home or at work if you're working. Uh, I'm pretty okay except for like, if I get sick. So yeah, it's been, I think it's pretty well managed. Like I stay on the top of my lifestyle now. Um, that's good. Do you have any allergies? Uh, uh, no. Uh, no. No analogies to medications. No. Okay. Okay. Good. And, um, do you, uh, just a couple more sort of, uh, general questions? Um, have you traveled anywhere outside the province recently? No. I guess I should have asked you earlier, but have you noticed any change in your sense of smell? Uh, no, I don't think so. Any change in your sense of taste? Um, no, I don't think so. Any confusion or fuzzy, um, feeling? Uh, nope. Okay. Any, um, muscle aches in your body? Uh, uh, no. Okay. All right. Um, and, uh, just, uh, some questions about your living situation. Do you currently live alone? Uh, and I, you mentioned that you have a dog. Um, are there any, is there anyone, anyone else in the house? Uh, my husband. Okay. Um, do you, uh, currently work? Yeah. I, uh, like I've been working from home. Um, I work for the municipality. I see. Do you think you might have had any, uh, soldiers to say, a desk or a smoke or anything like that that could have worsened your symptoms? Oh, thank you so. Okay. Uh, and, uh, do you drink alcohol? Oh, very, very, very. Okay. Do you smoke? I, I used to, uh, I quit once a day that I had COPD. Um, I smoked half a day for, probably 20 years. Okay. Okay. And do you consume marijuana or any recreational drugs? No. Okay. Uh, all right. Well, I guess one more question. Are there any, um, lung diseases or heart conditions or cancers that run in the family? Uh, no, nothing that I can think of. All right. Well, that, um, those are all the questions I had for you. Um, uh, we will now do a physical exam and, and look at your vitals and listen to your, uh, chest. Um, it's likely that what you have right now is a COPD exacerbation, maybe just a, um, like an infection that you got, which, uh, worsened some of your COPD symptoms. Um, we would also have to rule out COVID, so we'll be doing a COVID swab. And, uh, we'll decide based on the, um, on your labs and your vital signs. It's, uh, and some other things, whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted or if you are, um, good to go home. I will also talk to my attending and we'll meet those decisions, uh, together and come back and talk to you. Does that sound good to you? Yeah. Sounds great. Thank you.",
