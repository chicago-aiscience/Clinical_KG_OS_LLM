[D-1] Let's find a solution to your movement.
[P-1] Are you ready to lay girl there today?
[D-2] Yes, I did. It was behind my left knee,
[P-2] kind of in the joint behind where it bends.
[D-3] It was stuck pretty good.
[P-3] It's still kind of red and tender there.
[D-4] I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore.
[P-4] Not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there.
[D-5] And I found this tick I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it.
[P-5] It's in like this little plastic container.
[D-6] And I don't really know when I got it.
[P-6] I was hiking on Friday.
[D-7] And then Saturday I was out in my garden.
[P-7] I hope they're not around my house.
[D-8] I hope that it was from hiking and not gardening.
[P-8] But I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well.
[D-9] Okay, so it sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors.
[P-9] 21st noticed it.
[D-10] Yeah.
[P-10] Okay, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me.
[D-11] Is it quite swollen or engorged?
[P-11] It's not too bad.
[D-12] I had actually had a take in the past.
[P-12] And this is a long time ago and maybe like 10 years.
[D-13] And I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about.
[P-13] And at that time, I remember I had to take any biotics for a bit.
[D-14] Well, this didn't look like that.
[P-14] It was more, it was just kind of soaring once a lot.
[D-15] I don't think it was as bad as that time and the tick that time.
[P-15] Sorry, I've kind of got enough track that time.
[D-16] It was quite swollen.
[P-16] This one was maybe a little bit but not as much.
[D-17] Okay.
[P-17] So just in terms of the tick size,
[D-18] it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long.
[P-18] So when ticks are feeding, they tend to engorge.
[D-19] They tend to swell up.
[P-19] So this looks more like a tiny little bugger.
[D-20] Does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?
[P-20] No, this one's pretty small.
[D-21] This one's pretty small.
[P-21] Okay.
[D-22] And I should mention that what obviously you had a take in the past.
[P-22] It's a concern for us as a disease called Lyme disease,
[D-23] just spread by an bacteria.
[P-23] But in fact, only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission,
[D-24] a transmittoria, aged for it.
[P-24] It's called a deer tick.
[D-25] And its coloration has got a little bit of a brown,
[P-25] but and there's some black legs.
[D-26] Does it look like that at all?
[P-26] I don't think so.
[D-27] I was looking at the pictures online.
[P-27] I was looking at the pictures, like the other kind of tick.
[D-28] But I just heard that.
[P-28] Yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme.
[D-29] Because it's kind of become more of a problem.
[P-29] So that was making me a bit nervous.
[D-30] Okay, absolutely.
[P-30] What we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it.
[D-31] But for tick flights in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for.
[P-31] So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday,
[D-32] that means that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours.
[P-32] So I think one way or another we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics.
[D-33] Just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just to make sure that time you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease.
[P-33] I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways.
[D-34] But it's a disease that we try our best to avoid.
[P-34] And just in terms of your symptoms, they say you've had a bite in the past.
[D-35] You've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash.
[P-35] Do you have that rash now?
[D-36] No, I don't.
[P-36] As far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too.
[D-37] It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see.
[P-37] But it's it looks a little red and it's like tender where the tick was.
[D-38] But I don't see that like larger circle rash.
[P-38] Okay, that's reassuring.
[D-39] Now anything else, it would be unlikely for you to have other symptoms.
[P-39] But just in case, do you have any other joint pain?
[D-40] Nope.
[P-40] Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish and lost a little while?
[D-41] No, no, I've been fine.
[P-41] Okay.
[D-42] And you removed that tick once you found it, you presented to me.
[P-42] Have you checked your body for any other possible bites?
[D-43] Oh, yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too, because we were just a little bit, you know,
[P-43] gave us a little bit of a scare.
[D-44] But no, there's been nothing else.
[P-44] That's good.
[D-45] And did you bring a pet with you at all when you're hiking in the gardening?
[P-45] No, I didn't.
[D-46] No.
[P-46] Okay, good.
[D-47] Any other family members, do you think might have been exposed?
[P-47] No, it was just me and my husband.
[D-48] Okay.
[P-48] And what geographic area were you in when you were hiking?
[D-49] We were in the straf Roy along the creek.
[P-49] Okay.
[D-50] I can do, if I remember, there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario.
[P-50] And we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not.
[D-51] Yeah, I curse it.
[P-51] It's like straf Roy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.
[D-52] So I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics.
[P-52] But of course, we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well.
[D-53] So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms,
[P-53] aside from the notices tick, the skin around it is fairly sore.
[D-54] And you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past.
[P-54] And since then, you haven't had too many health problems after that?
[D-55] No, no, I've been pretty healthy.
[P-55] Okay.
[D-56] And just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general?
[P-56] In regarding your health?
[D-57] Just for my cholesterol.
[P-57] Okay. Are you taking any medications for that?
[D-58] Yeah, I take a statin.
[P-58] I can't remember which one.
[D-59] Okay.
[P-59] Got it.
[D-60] And do you have any allergies?
[P-60] No.
[D-61] So no drug allergies?
[P-61] No.
[D-62] Okay.
[P-62] I was already talked about other exposures,
[D-63] so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around.
[P-63] So it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in.
[D-64] And he said he might have gone this from gardening,
[P-64] but you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks.
[D-65] Maybe just take a look.
[P-65] Ticks like to live on long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields.
[D-66] Just see if there's any hovering around to kind of make a waving motion with their legs.
[P-66] And sometimes you just spot, you might want to get some insecticide out there.
[D-67] But it sounds like this is fairly recent.
[P-67] Unfortunately, just for the length of time, this tick might be on you for.
[D-68] It's probably safer than not to start you on some medications,
[P-68] but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick,
[D-69] that physical exam.
[P-69] And we might also send the tick off to local laboratories so they can identify the species for definitively,
[D-70] as well as my dissensum blood work just to see if there's any titers or any serology that make us
[P-70] a little bit more concerned for my disease.
[D-71] But aside from that, you've been feeling well up-the-wise.
[P-71] Yeah, totally fine.
[D-72] It was just a little tender there, and that's the only reason I looked.
[P-72] Okay, so no headaches.
[D-73] No.
[P-73] Nothing like that.
[D-74] Nothing like that.
[P-74] Nothing like that.
[D-75] Okay, excellent.
[P-75] All right, I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today.
[D-76] Do you have any questions for me, Jean?
[P-76] No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out.
[D-77] Okay, I'll go talk to the doctor.
[P-77] We'll come back and talk to you.
[D-78] Okay.
[P-78] Great.
[D-79] Thanks.
[P-79] Thanks, Jean.
