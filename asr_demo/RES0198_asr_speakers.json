And when were you diagnosed with that? When I was like seven? Okay. And so you have your insulin medication and you're are you all up to date with that? Yes. Okay. And do you see an endocrinologist?

Any other recreational drugs like cocaine, heroin, anything like that? Oh, no. No. And do you drink alcohol? No. And do you smoke tobacco? No. Okay. Yeah. Those were all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me? Yeah. How do I get rid of this? It's really been bugging me. Yeah. Kind of. So just the stuffiness and the runny nose. It seems like it's most likely a viral infection like the common cold. It takes a few weeks for the symptoms to get relieved, but there's not much that we can do besides supportive care. So make sure you get you stay well hydrated. You can use over the counter medications like Tylenol cold. If you to relieve some of your symptoms, but since right now we're in a pandemic, some of these symptoms can also be seen in COVID patients. So we will also get a swab done for you today and you should have the results back by 48 hours. And until then, we recommend that you say isolated in your own home and not see anyone else. And then once the results come back, you'll get further instructions from public health. Okay. That sounds great. Thank you. You're welcome. Take care. You too.",
