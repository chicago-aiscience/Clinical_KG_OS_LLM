[D-1] What brings you in today?
[P-1] So I have COPD and it's usually pretty manageable with my
[D-2] coffers and that, but just in the last three days, I feel like it's gotten a lot worse.
[P-2] I feel like I'm coughing more often and I'm now producing more
[D-3] students. I have a green, yellowy
[P-3] and I'm not using it as a foodie.
[D-4] I even noticed that there was a little blood a couple times when I was like really coughing hard.
[P-4] I think it's harder to breathe than usual.
[D-5] I have home often, I don't think I was quite there yet, but these last few days it's been
[P-5] really hard to breathe.
[D-6] Okay, so what's this has happened in the past three days? Have your symptoms gotten better or worse over this time?
[P-6] I feel like they've been maybe getting a little worse. They definitely haven't gotten better.
[D-7] Okay, and has this ever happened to you before?
[P-7] I've had some troubles like when I've been sick before where the cough has gotten pretty bad.
[D-8] This is probably the worst that I've had, but I have had some mycio-bees that made worse by being sick.
[P-8] I see. Okay. Well, I guess the first thing we're going to do, how bad is your shortness of breath?
[D-9] I've had a walk here fine, but I normally can walk around the block and I go for a walk usually a couple times a day to walk my dog.
[P-9] It's been a little bit trickier to do that.
[D-10] I see. Okay. Have you ever had any cost liations in the past specifically for thecio-bees, exacerbations?
[P-10] I haven't stayed over in the hospital. I'd like come to emerge a couple times.
[D-11] How many times? I think twice. You'd be over the last like three years.
[P-11] When were you diagnosed with thecio-bees?
[D-12] You four or five years ago?
[P-12] Was it formally diagnosed using the proper testing?
[D-13] Yeah. They referred me to a lung doctor.
[P-13] I see. Okay. And how do you have any fevers or chills?
[D-14] I feel like I may have had a fever last night. I don't really want to.
[P-14] Do you check your temperature?
[D-15] I don't have a thermometer at home.
[P-15] I have no problem. We can check your temperature here.
[D-16] I would say I had a fever.
[P-16] Have you had any other symptoms?
[D-17] Have you had a runny nose or a steppe?
[P-17] No knee pain in your sinus?
[D-18] I think I've had a bit of a pressure in the sinus area.
[P-18] The cost has been the thing that's been the most bothersome.
[D-19] Have you had a sore throat at all?
[P-19] No.
[D-20] Okay. A headache?
[P-20] Maybe a little bit.
[D-21] Any nausea or vomiting?
[P-21] Any diarrhea or constipation?
[D-22] No.
[P-22] Downal pain?
[D-23] No.
[P-23] Okay. And have you recently lost weight unintentionally?
[D-24] No. No, I wish but no.
[P-24] Okay. Have you had any night sweats where you feel like you're branched in sweats at night?
[D-25] No. Nothing like that.
[P-25] And have you had any exposures to anyone who could potentially be sick?
[D-26] I think I meet my...
[P-26] I meet a couple of friends to walk our dogs together outside.
[D-27] And one of them was a bit sick for a bit.
[P-27] We try not to get too close but maybe... I don't know, maybe sometimes we walk a little too close.
[D-28] We feel too safe because we're like outside.
[P-28] Okay.
[D-29] And did your friend get a COVID test done?
[P-29] No.
[D-30] That's okay.
[P-30] But you mentioned that you had a COPD that was diagnosed four or five years ago.
[D-31] Any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
[P-31] Um...
[D-32] Yeah, I have a high blood pressure.
[P-32] Okay. And are you taking any medications?
[D-33] I'm not... I've been talked about it but I decided to try to change my lifestyle as much as I could first.
[P-33] And I've also done that for the COPD. It's generally... I've been really trying to take care of it but I feel like I maybe got sick or something this time.
[D-34] Yeah.
[P-34] So my blood pressure is like, okay right now.
[D-35] I've had my blood pressure and then I lost weight and started this walking more.
[P-35] That's great. That's really, really good that you're taking better care of yourself.
[D-36] You should definitely continue doing that.
[P-36] Right.
[D-37] Of course, yeah.
[P-37] And you've mentioned that you have some buffers. How often do you use those?
[D-38] Um, the one that I use every day.
[P-38] Um, that I'm supposed to just use no matter what.
[D-39] And then the one that I use when, uh, kind of just when I need it, I probably use it like once every two weeks.
[P-39] Okay.
[D-40] Um, and you mentioned that your COPD is getting better.
[P-40] And affecting your life in any way, affecting the way that you're doing your daily activities at home or at work if you're working.
[D-41] Uh, I'm pretty okay except for like, if I get sick.
[P-41] So yeah, it's been, I think it's pretty well managed. Like I stay on the top of my lifestyle now.
[D-42] Um, that's good.
[P-42] Do you have any allergies?
[D-43] Uh, uh, no.
[P-43] Uh, no.
[D-44] No analogies to medications.
[P-44] No.
[D-45] Okay. Okay. Good.
[P-45] And, um, do you, uh, just a couple more sort of, uh, general questions?
[D-46] Um, have you traveled anywhere outside the province recently?
[P-46] No.
[D-47] I guess I should have asked you earlier, but have you noticed any change in your sense of smell?
[P-47] Uh, no, I don't think so.
[D-48] Any change in your sense of taste?
[P-48] Um, no, I don't think so.
[D-49] Any confusion or fuzzy, um, feeling?
[P-49] Uh, nope.
[D-50] Okay. Any, um, muscle aches in your body?
[P-50] Uh, uh, no.
[D-51] Okay. All right.
[P-51] Um, and, uh, just, uh, some questions about your living situation.
[D-52] Do you currently live alone?
[P-52] Uh, and I, you mentioned that you have a dog.
[D-53] Um, are there any, is there anyone, anyone else in the house?
[P-53] Uh, my husband.
[D-54] Okay.
[P-54] Um, do you, uh, currently work?
[D-55] Yeah. I, uh, like I've been working from home.
[P-55] Um, I work for the municipality.
[D-56] I see. Do you think you might have had any, uh, soldiers to say,
[P-56] a desk or a smoke or anything like that that could have worsened your symptoms?
[D-57] Oh, thank you so.
[P-57] Okay. Uh, and, uh, do you drink alcohol?
[D-58] Oh, very, very, very.
[P-58] Okay. Do you smoke?
[D-59] I, I used to, uh, I quit once a day that I had COPD.
[P-59] Um, I smoked half a day for, probably 20 years.
[D-60] Okay. Okay.
[P-60] And do you consume marijuana or any recreational drugs?
[D-61] No.
[P-61] Okay. Uh, all right.
[D-62] Well, I guess one more question.
[P-62] Are there any, um, lung diseases or heart conditions or cancers that run in the family?
[D-63] Uh, no, nothing that I can think of.
[P-63] All right. Well, that, um, those are all the questions I had for you.
[D-64] Um, uh, we will now do a physical exam and, and look at your vitals and listen to your, uh, chest.
[P-64] Um, it's likely that what you have right now is a COPD exacerbation, maybe just a, um,
[D-65] like an infection that you got, which, uh, worsened some of your COPD symptoms.
[P-65] Um, we would also have to rule out COVID, so we'll be doing a COVID swab.
[D-66] And, uh, we'll decide based on the, um, on your labs and your vital signs.
[P-66] It's, uh, and some other things, whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted or if you are, um, good to go home.
[D-67] I will also talk to my attending and we'll meet those decisions, uh, together and come back and talk to you.
[P-67] Does that sound good to you? Yeah. Sounds great. Thank you.
