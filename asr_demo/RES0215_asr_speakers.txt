[D-1] How can I help you today?
[P-1] Yeah, I brought I brought my eight-year-old daughter here because I've noticed that she's been quite weasy
[D-2] for the past four or five days and now she has a slight cough
[P-2] Sounds like she's a little short of breath. So I just wanted to get things checked out
[D-3] Okay
[P-3] so
[D-4] For the one at first present about four to five days ago. What did he notice? Notice first?
[P-4] I noticed that she was weasy
[D-5] and
[P-5] It's it seemed like she was having some difficulty taking in deep breaths
[D-6] Okay, now was this with any type of activity or just at rest?
[P-6] Yeah, she was playing tag with one of her cousins and
[D-7] She was quite out of breath after
[P-7] Okay, has she ever had anything like this before? No
[D-8] Like that. No, okay, and has it been fairly steady since then?
[P-8] Or has it been fluctuating? It's been fluctuating
[D-9] Okay, but it hasn't really gone away in a sense that you're still concerned coming now four days later
[P-9] Yeah, it's just it would she would have these these
[D-10] episodes but it would resolve on its own and then she would you know go back to doing some sort of activity
[P-10] And then she would have all these symptoms all over again, but when she rests
[D-11] Then it goes away. So I wasn't really sure to share what to think of it
