[D-1] So what brings you in?
[P-1] Okay, um
[D-2] So I have been coughing a lot over the past week or so
[P-2] and it's been pretty dry, but I've been coughing like
[D-3] almost non-stop throughout the day and I'm feeling very short of breath and
[P-3] I have my bronchodilator helps, but I find I'm using it a lot now
[D-4] Oh, if you know that you have asthma for
[P-4] I was diagnosed when I was eight
[D-5] You're 10 now
[P-5] That's right. So you're using your bronchodilator more. This is the one that you use kind of as needed
[D-6] Yeah, okay, and then do you have one that you take every day no matter what?
[P-6] um
[D-7] No, I don't have that one
[P-7] You just have the one that you take is needed um do you take any other medications?
[D-8] Um, I know I don't take anything else. Oh, okay, just the one is it a it's a puffer?
[P-8] Yes, okay
[D-9] Okay, and uh
[P-9] You're using it more than normal. So how often were you normally using it?
[D-10] Um, I was only using it like I don't know maybe once every two weeks or so not very often um
[P-10] But now I'm using it like
[D-11] I
[P-11] Almost every day like
[D-12] five six times a week
[P-12] Okay, and are you is it usually um turned out that you need it like during certain times like I say when you're exercising or when it's cold
[D-13] Um, I find I use it more both like when it when it's when I'm right after I like run around
[P-13] after jam during recess um and yeah, the cold also makes it worse
[D-14] Okay, and the other triggers that you can think of?
[P-14] Um
[D-15] No, no other triggers
[P-15] Normally uh get more in certain seasons
[D-16] um
[P-16] I don't know no uh big changes there
[D-17] Um, I find the cold air makes it worse like winter makes it worse or like
[P-17] Yeah, maybe also the spring spring with like um pollen and stuff like that
[D-18] Okay, so you have allergies too?
[P-18] Uh, I think so I haven't ever been like formally diagnosed

[P-19] Okay, uh
[D-20] So you say you've had more coughing lately. Is that right? So the last two weeks
[P-20] Or the last week last two weeks last two
[D-21] Has your cough been a dry cough?

[D-23] Okay
[P-23] Uh and that's uh
[D-24] Do you use your bronchodiliter every time that you're weezing?
[P-24] When it gets really bad like when I get so weezy that I find it hard to breathe
[D-25] Okay, so you're getting weezy even more times than than you're having to use your bronchodilator
[P-25] Yes, that's right
[D-26] Okay, are you having any symptoms at night time?

[D-32] Okay, does anyone that lives with you or anyone that you're around often has anyone been sick?

[P-40] um, but that's not you know what's happening right now
[D-41] We probably will do a COVID swab just because of the times that we're living in right now

[P-60] Okay, um, I think that's all my questions that I had for you today
[D-61] Um, what do you feel like you do for fun?
[P-61] Oh um, I like playing games online with my friends and
[D-62] um, before COVID we used to get together and have movie nights and
[P-62] Uh, play sports together
[D-63] That sounds really cool. Well, hopefully um, you can get this figured out for you so you don't have any uh, you know,
[P-63] Have to use your your medications every time you put a sports because that's no fun
[D-64] No, you should be able to enjoy that so
[P-64] So we're gonna try to get this sorted out for you. I'm gonna go talk to the doctor and tell them everything or her everything that you said
[D-65] and
[P-65] You'll come back and see you shortly. Hopefully
[D-66] Maybe all you need is a little change to your medications and maybe we'll be better be able to better control your asthma
[P-66] Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you. Hey, well, thanks for talking with me. We'll see you soon. Okay, great. Thanks
