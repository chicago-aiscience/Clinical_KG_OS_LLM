  "full_text": " What's your name? I'm Hi, so I've had this terrible fever for the past three days. And just before that, I had a stuffy nose. And I had a sore throat while I still do. And it's just not going away, so I thought I should just come in and see if I have COVID or what it is. Okay, so, if I understand, start with the stuffy nose. Yes. Okay, and that kind of progressed to a fever? Yes, that's right. Okay, have you been feeling any other symptoms aside from the fever? No. Nothing really? Have you had any nausea, any vomiting at all in last a little while? No. Any pain anywhere else in your body? No. Okay, do you have any next stiffness? No. Any headaches? No, no headaches. Okay, any of you have been able to eat and drink during this time period? Yes. Excellent. Okay, have you had a cough at all? No cough. No cough? Okay. And then how about abdominal pain? Do you need pain in your tummy? No. Nothing like that? No. Okay. What about other changes in your body? Have you noticed any fever or any rashes, any skin changes? No, nothing like that. Okay. What about any pain and any of your joints and your knees, hips? Oh, actually, not in my joints, but I've just... There has been some muscle ache. Okay. How long has that been going on for? For the past two, three days. So around the same time that you've had this fever... Mm-hmm. That's right. All right. Now, have you had any contact with anyone who's been sick in the last little while? No. Not that I can think of. Okay. Have you had any recent trauma anywhere else? No. I did go hiking last weekend. And it was about two hours away. There were some people on the hiking trail that I passed by, but... Other than that, no travel outside the province. Okay. Has anyone around you or in your immediate circle come down with anything similar recently? My husband has also been experiencing similar symptoms for the past week. Okay. How is he doing? Uh, the same as me. Okay. And have you had any COVID swabs recently? No. Okay. And aside from the weekend hike, have you been mainly self-isolating or...? Uh, yeah. Just me and my husband at home. Okay. And do you leave the house for work at all? No. I work from home. Okay. Sounds good. So you have some muscle aches, a little bit of fever, stuffy nose, sore throat. Do you have any difficulty swallowing? Uh, no. It just hurts. Okay. So you're still able to swallow the foods, swallow the quids? Yes. And I feel like anything is going down the wrong way. You have any coughing after you swallow? No. Okay. And just in terms of coming back to this sore throat, do you feel like you have any swelling around your neck? Uh. Is it feel inflamed or swollen? No. Nothing like that? No. All right. Excellent. So you're eating well, doing well. Any changes to your bowel movements recently? Uh, no. No. Okay. All right. I'll just kind of go into other things. Just in terms of anything else you might have had in the past. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason in your life? I had my gallbladder taken out five years ago. Okay. So that was around when you're 50 years old? Uh, yes. Okay. And any other surgeries you've had in your life? Uh, no. No. Anything you've had to see a doctor for? Um, I, well, in the past couple of years, uh, just for things like, like this, I guess, I'm cold. Uh, um, I'm pretty diabetic. So I've been checking my glucose levels. Yeah. Other than that, nothing else. So no high blood pressure? No. No cholesterol issues. No. Okay. So it sounds even pretty healthy otherwise. Yeah. Excellent. Okay. Do you have any allergies? Um. And medications or otherwise? Penicillin. Penicillin, what happens when you take penicillin? Um, I get a rash. Okay. Any trouble breathing? No. And what medications, if any, are you on? Um, I'm. I just take multivitamins. That's it though. Okay. And you said you live with your husband in a house, um, in London? Um, yes, that's right. What do you do to work? So I work from home as a digital marketing agent and has been as a computer programmer. Okay. Okay. Do you have anything else to say as your married woman? No. Who needs help from her super infant, and I've been to Samoak lately, visiting Westwood Avenue likerian gastric compound. No, no, no, no. And\ud0ddl\uc800 Meis barbecue. So you do stuff like that? No. Hold on, hold on. Do you? What did you do in general? Some odd stuff. And so it actually seemed to be nice. Then this is my plan. So you got to, I was, uh, Fuck. You know, you know like I do like chili and various that part That's, uh, it's kind of pretty good. bowls but not frequently. Understood. Have you ever used ivy drugs? No. Okay. What was your last menstrual period? It was a year ago. A year ago? Mm-hmm. And then otherwise we talked a little bit about recent travel. It sounds like you had the hiking trip last week and you pass some people but it sounds like your husband also has kind of similar symptoms that you do right now. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Now, if we're to talk about kind of past medical issues and moving on, I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam. But before I do that, do you have any questions for me? I should know. No. Do you think I have COVID? It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out. So, I'll be ordering a COVID swab no matter what. Obviously, with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So, it sounds like if your husband got in, you have it. COVID would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So, just while we're trying to investigate work this up further, we want to have you and your husband self-isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gone your flu shop this year? No, I haven't. Mm-hmm. So, it's also a possibility it might be influenza, just the season of flu. But until we, I suppose, rule out COVID, it would best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious for the mean while. Okay, sure. All right, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you, okay? All right, great. Thank you. Take care.",
