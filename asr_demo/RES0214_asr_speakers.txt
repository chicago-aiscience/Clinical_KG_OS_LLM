[P-2] And just before that, I had a stuffy nose.
[D-3] And I had a sore throat while I still do.

[D-22] For the past two, three days.

[D-23] Mm-hmm.
[P-23] That's right.
[D-24] All right.
[P-24] Now, have you had any contact with anyone who's been sick in the last little while?
[D-25] No.
[P-25] Not that I can think of.
[D-26] Okay.
[P-26] Have you had any recent trauma anywhere else?
[D-27] No.
[P-27] I did go hiking last weekend.
[D-28] And it was about two hours away.
[P-28] There were some people on the hiking trail that I passed by, but...
[D-29] Other than that, no travel outside the province.
[P-29] Okay.
[D-30] Has anyone around you or in your immediate circle come down with anything similar recently?
[P-30] My husband has also been experiencing similar symptoms for the past week.

[P-74] Do you have anything else to say as your married woman?
[D-75] No.
[P-75] Who needs help from her super infant, and I've been to Samoak lately, visiting Westwood Avenue
[D-76] likerian gastric compound.
[P-76] No, no, no, no.
[D-77] And택l저 Meis barbecue.
[P-77] So you do stuff like that?
[D-78] No.
[P-78] Hold on, hold on.
[D-79] Do you?
[P-79] What did you do in general?
[D-80] Some odd stuff.
[P-80] And so it actually seemed to be nice.
[D-81] Then this is my plan.
[P-81] So you got to, I was, uh, Fuck.
[D-82] You know, you know like I do like chili and various that part That's, uh,
[P-82] it's kind of pretty good.
[D-83] bowls but not frequently.
[P-83] Understood.
[D-84] Have you ever used ivy drugs?
[P-84] No.
[D-85] Okay.
[P-85] What was your last menstrual period?
[D-86] It was a year ago.
[P-86] A year ago?
[D-87] Mm-hmm.
[P-87] And then otherwise we talked a little bit about recent travel.
[D-88] It sounds like you had the hiking trip last week and you pass some people but
[P-88] it sounds like your husband also has kind of similar symptoms that you do right now.
[D-89] Yeah.
[P-89] Okay.
[D-90] Sounds good.
[P-90] Now, if we're to talk about kind of past medical issues and moving on,
[D-91] I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam.
[P-91] But before I do that, do you have any questions for me?
[D-92] I should know.
[P-92] No. Do you think I have COVID?
[D-93] It's a possibility.
[P-93] It's always good to rule these things out.
[D-94] So, I'll be ordering a COVID swab no matter what.
[P-94] Obviously, with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever
[D-95] and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious.
[P-95] So, it sounds like if your husband got in, you have it.
[D-96] COVID would be our first thing that we want to rule out.
[P-96] So, just while we're trying to investigate work this up further,
[D-97] we want to have you and your husband self-isolate.
[P-97] The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gone your flu shop this year?
[D-98] No, I haven't.
[P-98] Mm-hmm.
[D-99] So, it's also a possibility it might be influenza, just the season of flu.
[P-99] But until we, I suppose, rule out COVID,
[D-100] it would best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious for the mean while.
[P-100] Okay, sure.
[D-101] All right, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you, okay?
[P-101] All right, great. Thank you.
[D-102] Take care.
