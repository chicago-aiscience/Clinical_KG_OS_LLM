  "full_text": " what brings you all in today. Hi. So I just flooded my son. So he's five. Essentially when he, uh, so to do, uh, when he got home from school and Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he, I don't know, that night he started to have a bit of like a car. I just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home. Keep him safe and not like, if there anything if he was sick. So he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. And then yesterday, it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired. Uh, sorry. Today, today is Friday. Um, he was like, his cough is like getting a bit worse. I've been taking his tent the whole time. And I got like a little high. Um, today, uh, what was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember. It was, it was, um, it was like over a hundred. So, uh, okay. A hundred and one or something, or maybe a hundred point one. If the anyways, it was, so I just thought I should probably bring him in because I was really worried about him and, you know, thought he could have maybe got COVID and get school or something. Yeah, for sure. Um, okay. So just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five, five days. Okay. Um, okay. So let's focus on the cough. Sorry. It's been more like three, three days, like one day, when he came home and then, um, and then today's Friday. So yeah, sorry. Today's Friday. Okay. Okay. Yep. Sure. Uh, so, is this cough a productive cough or is it kind of a dry cough? Uh, I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like sitting. Not many think. Um, yeah, he's, yeah, it's been like little cough. Okay. And he is, he's not bringing up any sputum or blood. No. No. Okay, good. Okay. And does he sound easy at all to you? No. No, no, no, no. But I've noticed. Okay. How about short of breath? Um, I don't think so. Like he, usually he's a really active kid and he has, he hasn't been running, um, a lot outside in the past couple days. So maybe he, maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing, but also I think he's just been tired in general. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And is his coffin getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night in the morning? I think it's kind of just there the whole day. Okay. And does it, how does it sound? Does it sound like a barkey cough? Does it sound um, a car? What is, what would you say the quality of his, of the sound of the coffees? Uh, I, just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud. Okay. Okay. And, have you ever experienced anything like this in the past? Uh, like he's had cold before, but I haven't, like I haven't, like he, this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than, you know, having a regular cold. Okay. And, are his symptoms getting worse? I, I think so, because yeah, the first day he just seemed like a little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he, like, actually has a fever. Okay. And, um, is he complaining of anything like chest pain, or feeling like his heart's racing? Uh, no, I don't think so. No, okay. Um, does he have a sore throat? Hmm. Uh, I don't think so. Okay. Um, is he having any issues following food or fluids? No, I don't know if he's having trouble slowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now. Okay. Um, and is he, um, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose? Maybe a bit of like a, like a runny nose. Okay. And, does he have any issues with smell or taste? Uh, like this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast. And he's wondering if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit. Okay. Uh, have a vision or hearing? I think those are fine. Okay. And, is he complaining of any chills or night sweats? No. Okay. Any changes in his hair, nails, or skin like brushes? No, I haven't noticed anything like that. Okay. Any changes in his bowel movements? Um, pardon? Inside of changes. Okay. No diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool. Um. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? No. Okay. Any changes in his urine? Um, I haven't really been looking, but I don't think so. Okay. Any dizziness or fainting spells? Um, no. Just like the teag. Okay. Any, uh, confusion or memory loss? No. No. Okay. And is he, and, uh, is he, uh, uh, um, an otherwise healthy child? Yeah, he hasn't, like, decided to, like, a vaccine, and then he hasn't had to go to the doctor, like, ever, like, many of his broken arm bones, so that was it. Okay. Um, so, no past illnesses and, I guess, no hospitalizations or surgeries, except for the broken arm. Exactly. Like, nothing. Okay. And were things normal with your, uh, pregnancy with him? Yeah, totally. Okay. Um, and then have it as a newborn, any complications after birth? Um, no. No, like, everything is, and it's really good. Okay. And then did he hit all his milestones, um, up till now? Yeah, okay. Okay. Um, any, does he have any allergies? Um, no, no, thanks, though. I mean, like, he hasn't really taken a lot of medicines, so it's hard to say, but, like, nothing. So far. Is he up to date with all his immunizations? Yeah. Yeah, okay. And in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions? Uh, no, everyone's really healthy. Okay. And, um, are there, and who does he live with and where does he live? Uh, he lives with me and I have learned, and he has a little sister like this in town here. Okay. And, uh, is she healthy? Yeah, like she is healthy. Okay. Um, any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos, or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in? No. No, okay. Um, has he been around any said contacts recently? Not like outside of school. Like, we know for sure not outside of school, and that he goes to school right now. So, um, kind of hard to say. Okay. They haven't, they haven't like contacted us about anything. Okay, sure. Um, and has he traveled anywhere recently? No. No, okay. Okay. Well, those are all the questions I have for you today. Was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today? I don't think so. Um, like I realized that like, oftentimes, like, you don't really do much. Um, for kids when, you know, when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess, need to have a COVID test to go back to the school, even if, you know, either way, because they want us to be able to say it's like the other kids have had a, uh, an exosure. Yeah. Yeah. Like, all right, go ahead. No, go ahead. Um, so that's the thing. I'm not interested. I wanted to see if it was that. And I mean, he does receive her. So that's kind of what they make her in the kids. They're doing it a little bit. Right. Yeah. Okay. So first thing is first we need to do a COVID swap just to make sure that he either has it or doesn't have it. And those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. And we do suggest because of symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolated for 14 days. And that includes from his, his younger sister, if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives, but also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. Um, if his symptoms get worse, uh, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or, um, if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fating spells, uh, please do take him to the ER. And, um, so for now, we'll just wait for those COVID swaps to come back. How does that sound? Yeah, sounds good. Okay. Thank you. I know where he's, um, and I should have mentioned, um, if it was just the cough or if he was just sort of breath or something like that, and he didn't have the fever, we would add everything like asthma, um, to the list of things he could be worked up for. But, um, right now it sounds like a, it sounds like an infection. Okay. Yeah, that's good to know. All right. Sounds great. Have a good day. You too, thanks.",
