[D-1] So what brings you into clinic today? Hey, I just have this cough that's been like really bothering me.
[P-1] Okay, how long have you had that for?
[D-2] Uh, like, in the past few days, it's been really like gross and I've been coughing up this like gunk,
[P-2] but I've had it through, I've honestly had a cough for like three months. It's just like,
[D-3] sometimes it's like there and sometimes it kind of goes away. It feels like it keeps coming back.
[P-3] Okay, have you had any chest pain?
[D-4] Um, no, like, it kind of hurts when I cough now, but not like on its own.
[P-4] Okay, have you noticed any fevers at home?
[D-5] Uh, I've been feeling like hot at night in the past couple days, but like I didn't actually take my
[P-5] time. Okay, have you had any night sweats? You wake up, the sheets are soaked?
[D-6] Uh, no, not that.
[P-6] Nothing like that? Okay, have you noticed any unexplained weight loss over the last little while?
[D-7] Um, no. So, I go on the scale you lost a few pounds, but you haven't been trying too basically.
[P-7] No, like I, I don't really weigh myself, but I don't think so.
[D-8] So you haven't been noticing clothes have been fitting loose or anything like that?
[P-8] No, no, like I wish, but no.
[D-9] Got it, got it. Now let's talk about what you're bringing up with your cough. What color is it?
[P-9] It's really gross. It's kind of like greenish.
[D-10] Greenish? Okay. Yeah, I didn't know if there's any red or any blood with it.
[P-10] No. Okay. And does it smell at all? Smell funky?
[D-11] Hmm, I haven't noticed.
[P-11] Okay, so you've just been bringing this stuff up for the last couple of days,
[D-12] one specifically two days ago, three days ago.
[P-12] Like maybe, maybe three days? Three days ago. And you said before that, you kind of had this dry
[D-13] cough before. When did you first notice that three months ago, you said? Yeah, I was, uh,
[P-13] I do like, um, it's like sound silly, but I do like a pole dancing class just for exercise.
[D-14] And I was like at my class and I kind of just started to like feel like I was like a little coffee and,
[P-14] I don't think there's anything special that was just like what I noticed it.
[D-15] Okay. Anyone at the class sick at that time?
[P-15] I don't think so. Like it's a really long time ago. I don't really remember.
[D-16] Got it, got it. Anyone sick near you or around you in the last couple of weeks?
[P-16] Hmm. No. No, I, no, I can think of.
[D-17] Okay. And regards others. Uh, any, we already talked about chest pain. Uh, you've been able to eat
[P-17] food all right? Uh, yeah. Like a, yeah, it's like pretty normal.
[D-18] No, no, no, no vomiting. Uh, no, none of that. You don't have a stiff neck at all, do you?
[P-18] No, no, I don't. Okay. But how about other parts of your body? Any pain, tenderness anywhere?
[D-19] Hmm. I don't think so. No, like I'm a little tired now. Um, like the cough is like maybe for like a month,
[P-19] it's been kind of waking me up a little bit. So my, my sleep hasn't been great, but I don't think
[D-20] it's like I have like pain. I'm just like tired. Okay. So the cough does wake you up at night?
[P-20] Yeah. Does it wake you up every night?
[D-21] Yeah, they're pretty well for like the last, not like all three months, but probably the last month.
[P-21] Okay.
[D-22] All right. I'm just going to move on. Talk a little bit about you in the past.
[P-22] So any issues that you've seen a doctor for before?
[D-23] Uh, just like, like, Xima. Okay. And do you take anything for that?
[P-23] Um, just like moisturizing creams. Um, like my family doctor back home said like a couple times
[D-24] when it was really bad, she would give me one like to go get like shoppers, but right now it's
[P-24] not bad. So I just have just like a regular cream. Got it? Have you ever been hospitalized before?
[D-25] Uh, no. Okay. Any surgeries? No. Okay. So aside from the Xima sounds like you're pretty healthy,
[P-25] eh? Yeah. Okay. Do you have any allergies? Uh, I think maybe, um, maybe cats, because I,
[D-26] I don't have one, but sometimes I've noticed stuff, but I've never, like, it's never really been too
[P-26] big of a new shoe. Okay. So you've never taken any medications? You're got stung by a bee and
[D-27] had any trouble breathing or eaten a certain food? No. Nothing like that. Okay. Are you taking any
[P-27] medications right now? Uh, no. Okay. And do you just go to Western? Do you live near campus with
[D-28] anyone? Uh, I have like a roommate. Yeah, we, I live in an apartment with a roommate. Okay.
[P-28] Have they been sick at all in the last little while? No. Okay. I had a last little while, have you done any
[D-29] traveling? No. So I haven't been outside the country or any exotic locales in the last little while?
[P-29] No. Like I'm planning to on March break, but I haven't gone anywhere. Got it. Got it. See,
[D-30] live in town, uh, with your roommate and you're calling a full-time student? Mm-hmm. Okay.
[P-30] And just regards anything. Do you smoke? Uh, no. Like I don't, um, I don't smoke cigarettes. Like
[D-31] sometimes, sometimes smoke marijuana that usually, um, usually it's like the vape. Okay. How fun
[P-31] do you say do that a week? Oh, like maybe like once every like two weeks or something. Got it.
[D-32] Any other substances? Flush drugs? No. Like alcohol sometimes. Like. Okay. So no cocaine, no heroin?
[P-32] No. And have you ever, um, injected drugs into your body? No. Got it. Got it. Let's come back to alcohol.
[D-33] Uh, how often would you say drink? Maybe like one, one night, like on the weekend. Okay. And what
[P-33] do you, how would you do drink? How much do you drink? I don't know. Maybe like five or six
[D-34] beers. I guess it just depends on the name. Got it. Got it. And other questions. One was your
[P-34] last menstrual period? Maybe like two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Okay. Are you sexually active?
[D-35] Uh, yeah, just with my boyfriend. Okay. So then and do you two use contraception? First control.
[P-35] Yeah, we use, uh, like condoms. Okay. Any chance you can be pregnant right now?
[D-36] That's a strange question to ask if you're sexually active, but any unprotected sex in the last two
[P-36] weeks? No. Got it. All right. And we'll just kind of going over things. So it sounds like you've
[D-37] had this cough or a cough for a little while, but it's only become bad in the last three days.
[P-37] You're waking up at night and you're kind of bringing up this foul or not this foul, but this kind of
[D-38] greenish spewed on, but it's no blood in it. And otherwise you don't have any constitutional symptoms.
[P-38] So I will go review your story with the doctors or anything else you'd like to bring up with them
[D-39] before I go. I don't think so. I just like, I like, I hope I just can feel better because I've been
[P-39] missing like my exercise stuff because I feel like it's like coughing and it makes it hard to like
[D-40] do well. Got it. Got it. We'll see what we can do. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Thanks.
