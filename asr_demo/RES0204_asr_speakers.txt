[D-3] And we'll talk about it and then we'll come back and let you know what the next steps
[P-3] are going to be.

[P-6] away or getting better.

[P-11] Is that right?

[P-13] Yeah.
[D-14] No, nothing like that.
[P-14] Okay.
[D-15] So to start it, do you think it's gotten worse or have it kind of stayed the same?

[D-48] No.
[P-48] I've been pretty healthy otherwise.
[D-49] I've never had, like I've never had like a dry cough like this.
[P-49] I've had runny nose in the past, but they never lasted this long.
[D-50] Okay.
[P-50] Have you ever been in the hospital?
[D-51] No.

[P-53] No.
[D-54] Do you take any medicines?
[P-54] No.
[D-55] Okay.
[P-55] This may be a tricky one to answer, so Mum will definitely help us.
[D-56] Do you have any family history of respiratory problems?
[P-56] Um, um, uh, his grandparents had, um, asthma, but he's been worked up for that, um, and
[D-57] he doesn't get short of breath or wisi or anything like that with, even with physical
[P-57] activity, so.
[D-58] Oh, okay.
[P-58] Yeah.
[D-59] So he doesn't have that, um, and what else?
[P-59] Pardon me?
[D-60] I said just some asthma in the family.
[P-60] Yeah.
[D-61] Okay.
[P-61] And, uh, so you live, you live with your mum, do you live with anyone else in your family?
[D-62] Um, I have a four year old sister.
[P-62] Okay.
[D-63] Do you live with, uh, your dad too?
[P-63] Yes.
[D-64] Okay.
[P-64] Do you guys have any pets?
[D-65] Um, no, no pets.
[P-65] Um, and, uh, does anyone smoke in the home?
[D-66] Nope, no.
[P-66] Okay.
[D-67] And what do you like to do for fun?
[P-67] Um, I like playing with my friends.
[D-68] I like playing video games.
[P-68] Well, what's your favorite game?
[D-69] Um, I'm playing Roller Coaster Tycoon.
[P-69] Oh, cool.
[D-70] That sounds like fun.
[P-70] Okay.
[D-71] Well, hopefully we can get you back to feeling healthy so you can continue to play
[P-71] lots of Roller Coaster Tycoon.
[D-72] I want to go get the doctor that I'm working with.
[P-72] I'm, uh, I'm wondering, you know, if he might want to do a chest x-ray and get a better
[D-73] look at, uh, what's going on there.
[P-73] Have you ever had an x-ray before?
[D-74] I don't think so, no.
[P-74] Do you know what an x-ray is?
[D-75] Um, a little bit, yeah.
[P-75] Yeah, it's like taking picture of your body on the inside.
[D-76] It's pretty cool.
[P-76] Um, so it gives this idea of what's going on in the inside.
[D-77] Also, this really, this part is kind of, uh, not so much fun.
[P-77] But I think we should probably do a COVID swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately.
[D-78] And that's not a lot of fun.
[P-78] We got to stick something up your nose, but I think that you're really brave.
[D-79] And I think that you'll be just fine with it, okay?
[P-79] Okay.
[D-80] So we're going to arrange for these things.
[P-80] And then I will come back with the doctor that I'm working with.
[D-81] And we'll kind of talk about where to go from here.
[P-81] Okay, that sounds good.
[D-82] Hey, well, thank you guys for chatting with me.
[P-82] Yeah, thank you.
[D-83] Yeah, thanks.
