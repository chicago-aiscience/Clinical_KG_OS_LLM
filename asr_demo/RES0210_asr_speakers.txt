[D-1] So can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in here today?
[P-1] Yeah, I've noticed I've had this pretty bad cough for like the last couple of days.
[D-2] I'm a little bit worried. I want to talk to someone.
[P-2] Okay, so started two days ago?
[D-3] No, about what day is it today?
[P-3] It's Wednesday. It started on Sunday.
[D-4] Sunday is a noiseless start getting really bad.
[P-4] Okay, so it got really bad then.
[D-5] Was it, was it still present but not as bad before that?
[P-5] Yeah, I think I had like a bit of like a raspy cough on like Friday.
[D-6] It's Sunday. It was when I started getting nervous about it.
[P-6] Okay, so almost too weak.
[D-7] It sounds like.
[P-7] And what exactly changed on Sunday that you made it worse in your opinion?
[D-8] So Sunday I started bringing.
[P-8] I noticed like little spots of red.
[D-9] Kind of in the the guncows bringing up.
[P-9] Okay, and I kind of ignored it.
[D-10] But the next day there was still there.
[P-10] I started getting fever.
[D-11] Just didn't I felt off, you know?
[P-11] Okay.
[D-12] Okay, so that you first noticed that on Sunday where you bringing up.
[P-12] Yeah, that's right.
[D-13] Okay, so I discussed the sputum before that.
[P-13] And it just didn't have these spots.
[D-14] Or did it did that part just start on Sunday?
[P-14] Sputums kind of like the gunk, I've been bringing.
[D-15] Yeah, it's, uh, it's like this yellow.
[P-15] Custard, it's got like little spots of red on it on Sunday.
[D-16] Okay, and before that did you have like the yellow custard without.
[P-16] Or it all started at once.
[D-17] All kind of started at once to be honest.
[P-17] tricky questions. And you said that you've had some fevers. Can you give me a little bit about that?
[D-18] When did that start? So that started the Monday really was when I first started. I never took my
[P-18] temperature. I just felt hot, you know. That's been going on pretty much until today.
[D-19] Did you ever feel like you were really shaky? Yeah, I've been getting the chills, especially
[P-19] last two days. Okay. So over this time, you've had this cough. Have you felt like you've had
[D-20] difficulty breathing? Not real. I feel a little bit winded doing things I used to do. Like I take
[P-20] the stairs up to my apartment. But I have just happened really trying to exert myself. It's been
[D-21] taking it easy. So I would really notice being out of breath now. Okay. So probably if you were to
[P-21] get up and do a lot of physical activity, you would feel worse. Yeah, I can probably, I can still
[D-22] take the two stairs up to my apartment. But after that, I start to feel pretty crummy. Okay.
[P-22] Is there anything else that you can think of that makes it feel worse?
[D-23] No. Okay. Has anything helped it to feel better at all?
[P-23] Bringing up gunk makes it feel better for a little while. Okay. So you kind of just clear it
[D-24] up and that feels a little bit better. Yeah. I haven't been taking some time at home and that
[P-24] helps a little bit. Okay. Have you felt a sore throat at the same time?
[D-25] Okay. After an awful lot of coughing, yeah, it starts to feel a little raw.
[P-25] Okay. Have you had a runny nose? Yeah, a bit of one back in the, maybe a week ago, but that
[D-26] kind of gone away by now. Okay. Have you felt any chest pain? Yeah. Yeah. I got a pain. Kind of on
[P-26] the right. Okay. Have you ever, have you ever had anything like this before? No, never.
[D-27] Actually, Doc, you're saying something that makes it feel worse? Uh-huh.
[P-27] Taking a deep breath makes it feel pretty bad. Okay. And I'm just going to circle back to
[D-28] this chest pain. You said you feel it on the right side. Is it always there or is it just when
[P-28] you take a deep breath or is it kind of on and off? It's kind of always there. It gets a little
[D-29] bit worse with coughing when I take a pretty deep breath. Yeah. Okay. But if you were just laying down
[P-29] not coughing, is that pain there? Yeah. Yeah. Especially notice over the last day.
[D-30] Okay. Kind of dull. Okay. Um, I mean, how did you wait last recently?
[P-30] No, not really. Okay. Okay. Uh, have you traveled anywhere recently?
[D-31] I went to Sarnia about a week back for work, but. Okay. Were you in contact with anyone that,
[P-31] uh, that was sick? Nope. It's been keeping it to myself mostly. Okay. Okay. Um, so in terms of your own
[D-32] medical history, do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly?
[P-32] Uh, yeah. He's giving me a pill for cholesterol. Okay. Um, and do you know the names of any medications that you take?
[D-33] Uh, lipitor. Okay. Is that the only one? Yeah. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries?
[P-33] Uh, my wisdom teeth out as a kid, 15 or so, I think. Okay.
[D-34] Do you have any allergies? No. Okay. Um, I'm just going to ask you a few questions about your
[P-34] lifestyle. Do you live here in town? Yep. I live here in town. I got a girlfriend living in an apartment.
[D-35] Okay. You live with your girlfriend? Yeah. Okay. Um, do you have any pets?

[D-36] Yeah, I still work. Um, I'm a consultant for the chemical plants out west, mainly in Sarni.
[P-36] Okay. So have you had a lot of exposure to chemicals throughout your career?
[D-37] Now, they've always been pretty good for keeping it safe. I'm on the engineering side of things,
[P-37] so I don't really work too much in the plant directly, you know? Okay.
[D-38] There. Um, they'll, do you drink alcohol?
