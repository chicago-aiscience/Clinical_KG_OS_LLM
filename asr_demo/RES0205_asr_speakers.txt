[D-1] I'm going to be having a chat with you today and I do how things are going and then I'll
[P-1] go over it with the position that I'm working with and we can come back together and talk
[D-2] to you about the next step.
[P-2] So that's how good to you?
[D-3] Okay.
[P-3] I hear that you've been having an experience in a cough.
[D-4] Can you tell me a little bit about that?
[P-4] Yeah.
[D-5] I've had this cough for the past two weeks and it just doesn't go.
[P-5] Have you ever had anything like this before?
[D-6] I usually get a cold once a year or so but the cough doesn't last this long.
[P-6] It's usually over in a week or a week and a half or so.
[D-7] It's just not letting up.
[P-7] Okay.
[D-8] I'm going to ask you a few questions about the cough itself.
[P-8] Is this a dry cough you're experiencing or are you producing any mucus or coughing
[D-9] off anything?
[P-9] There was some mucus earlier on but now it's a dry cough.
[D-10] Now it's dry.
[P-10] Okay.
[D-11] How long?
[P-11] What was the timeline for that I guess?
[D-12] Well, yeah.
[P-12] So maybe for the first four or five days there was this like whitish, clear kind of mucus
[D-13] that was coming up and then after that was a dry cough.
[P-13] Okay.
[D-14] Okay.
[P-14] And do you feel like the intensity of the cough got worse over the last two weeks or has
[D-15] it gotten any better?
[P-15] It's kind of the same I would say.
[D-16] Has the cough gotten more frequent over this time as well?
[P-16] No.
[D-17] Okay.
[P-17] How often would you say that you're coughing?
[D-18] It's hard for me to quantify maybe a couple of times an hour, maybe three or four times
[P-18] an hour or so.
[D-19] Okay.
[P-19] Is there anything you can think of that triggers the cough or is it fun to be able to
[D-20] have a kind of spontaneous, can't really think of anything.
[P-20] Okay.
[D-21] And along with the cough are you experiencing any difficulty breathing?
[P-21] No.
[D-22] Okay.
[P-22] Have you noticed any fevers?
[D-23] No.
[P-23] Okay.
[D-24] Have you had any sore throat?
[P-24] I did initially for the first two or three days and then that got better.
[D-25] Okay.
[P-25] Have you had any runny nose?
[D-26] I did initially.
[P-26] I had had all those flu symptoms for the first couple of days but the cough just kind
[D-27] of stayed.
[P-27] Everything else resolved in the first three or four days I would say.
[D-28] Okay.
[P-28] Thank you for sharing that.
[D-29] Did you have any chest pain at any point?
[P-29] No, but I guess sometimes I'm coughing too much and I just hurt a little bit.
[D-30] Okay.
[P-30] So it feels kind of sore after all of that.
[D-31] Yeah.
[P-31] Okay.
[D-32] Okay.
[P-32] Have you been in contact?
[D-33] I guess it's hard to say because it started a while ago but before it started breathing
[P-33] in contact with anyone that's been sick.
[D-34] I worked at the hospital but I'm wearing PPE all the time and I'm very careful.
[P-34] So what?
[D-35] Have you traveled anywhere outside of the province?
[P-35] No.
[D-36] Okay.
[P-36] Have you had any nothar vomiting?
[D-37] No.
[P-37] Okay.
[D-38] Any belly pain?
[P-38] No.
[D-39] Okay.
[P-39] So I'm just going to ask you some questions about your overall health.
[D-40] Have you had any respiratory problems in the past?
[P-40] No.
[D-41] Okay.
[P-41] Are you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly?
[D-42] I've got acid reflux and I also have anxiety.
[P-42] Are you currently taking any medication?
[D-43] I used to not anymore.
[P-43] Was there any particular medication that you stopped recently?
[D-44] No.
[P-44] I used to take something for anxiety three years ago.
[D-45] What do you do for your reflux?
[P-45] I just avoid, right now I'm just trying to avoid the foods that make things worse for
[D-46] me and I feel like that helps me quite a bit.
[P-46] So yeah.
[D-47] I've weighed acidic foods and chocolates and things like that.
[P-47] That's so fun.
[D-48] Yeah.
[P-48] Do you have any allergies?
[D-49] Just hay fever.
[P-49] And do you have any family history of respiratory problems or heart problems?
[D-50] No.
[P-50] Okay.
[D-51] Okay.
[P-51] And I have a few terms of your lifestyle.
[D-52] Do you live with family?
[P-52] I live with my partner.
[D-53] Okay.
[P-53] And do you have any kids or pets living with you?
[D-54] No.
[P-54] Do you smoke?
[D-55] I don't know.
[P-55] Do you doubt the whole?
[D-56] Okay.
[P-56] So you live with family on Christmas?
[D-57] Okay.
[P-57] Do you use the other substance?
[D-58] No.
[P-58] Okay.
[D-59] And what do you do for work?
[P-59] I'm a clerk at the hospital.
[D-60] Okay.
[P-60] Right.
[D-61] You did say you were normal.
[P-61] Hi.
[D-62] I can't think.
[P-62] I thought I had another question for you, but I can't remember.
[D-63] Oh.
[P-63] Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about that I didn't ask you?
[D-64] No.
[P-64] I guess I was just wondering why I still have a cough.
[D-65] It's been such a long time.
[P-65] Yeah.
[D-66] And I was wondering if I could get any medications just to help with it.
[P-66] It's not really, yeah, it's everyone's like scared up work when I cough.
[D-67] I have had the COVID test done.
[P-67] I don't have it.
[D-68] Sorry.
[P-68] Yeah.
[D-69] Okay.
[P-69] When was that last test done?
[D-70] I had the test done, or when I first started out in symptoms about two weeks ago, since
[P-70] it happened at home.
[D-71] And I'm just waiting for my symptoms to get better.
[P-71] But I, you know, I kind of want to get back.
[D-72] And I don't want to be coughing when I get back.
[P-72] Yeah.
[D-73] Okay.
[P-73] Well, I'm going to have a quick listen to your heart and lungs.
[D-74] I'll see a quick discipline, Sam.
[P-74] And then I will go get the doctor that I'm working with.
[D-75] I'll kind of go over everything you talk about.
[P-75] And then we'll come back and talk to you about where to go from here.
[D-76] Sounds great.
[P-76] Okay.
[D-77] Well, thanks for chatting with me.
[P-77] Welcome.
