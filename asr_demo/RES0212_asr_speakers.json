  "full_text": " So what brings you into clinic today? Hey, I just have this cough that's been like really bothering me. Okay, how long have you had that for? Uh, like, in the past few days, it's been really like gross and I've been coughing up this like gunk, but I've had it through, I've honestly had a cough for like three months. It's just like, sometimes it's like there and sometimes it kind of goes away. It feels like it keeps coming back. Okay, have you had any chest pain? Um, no, like, it kind of hurts when I cough now, but not like on its own. Okay, have you noticed any fevers at home? Uh, I've been feeling like hot at night in the past couple days, but like I didn't actually take my time. Okay, have you had any night sweats? You wake up, the sheets are soaked? Uh, no, not that. Nothing like that? Okay, have you noticed any unexplained weight loss over the last little while? Um, no. So, I go on the scale you lost a few pounds, but you haven't been trying too basically. No, like I, I don't really weigh myself, but I don't think so. So you haven't been noticing clothes have been fitting loose or anything like that? No, no, like I wish, but no. Got it, got it. Now let's talk about what you're bringing up with your cough. What color is it? It's really gross. It's kind of like greenish. Greenish? Okay. Yeah, I didn't know if there's any red or any blood with it. No. Okay. And does it smell at all? Smell funky? Hmm, I haven't noticed. Okay, so you've just been bringing this stuff up for the last couple of days, one specifically two days ago, three days ago. Like maybe, maybe three days? Three days ago. And you said before that, you kind of had this dry cough before. When did you first notice that three months ago, you said? Yeah, I was, uh, I do like, um, it's like sound silly, but I do like a pole dancing class just for exercise. And I was like at my class and I kind of just started to like feel like I was like a little coffee and, I don't think there's anything special that was just like what I noticed it. Okay. Anyone at the class sick at that time? I don't think so. Like it's a really long time ago. I don't really remember. Got it, got it. Anyone sick near you or around you in the last couple of weeks? Hmm. No. No, I, no, I can think of. Okay. And regards others. Uh, any, we already talked about chest pain. Uh, you've been able to eat food all right? Uh, yeah. Like a, yeah, it's like pretty normal. No, no, no, no vomiting. Uh, no, none of that. You don't have a stiff neck at all, do you? No, no, I don't. Okay. But how about other parts of your body? Any pain, tenderness anywhere? Hmm. I don't think so. No, like I'm a little tired now. Um, like the cough is like maybe for like a month, it's been kind of waking me up a little bit. So my, my sleep hasn't been great, but I don't think it's like I have like pain. I'm just like tired. Okay. So the cough does wake you up at night? Yeah. Does it wake you up every night? Yeah, they're pretty well for like the last, not like all three months, but probably the last month. Okay. All right. I'm just going to move on. Talk a little bit about you in the past. So any issues that you've seen a doctor for before? Uh, just like, like, Xima. Okay. And do you take anything for that? Um, just like moisturizing creams. Um, like my family doctor back home said like a couple times when it was really bad, she would give me one like to go get like shoppers, but right now it's not bad. So I just have just like a regular cream. Got it? Have you ever been hospitalized before? Uh, no. Okay. Any surgeries? No. Okay. So aside from the Xima sounds like you're pretty healthy, eh? Yeah. Okay. Do you have any allergies? Uh, I think maybe, um, maybe cats, because I, I don't have one, but sometimes I've noticed stuff, but I've never, like, it's never really been too big of a new shoe. Okay. So you've never taken any medications? You're got stung by a bee and had any trouble breathing or eaten a certain food? No. Nothing like that. Okay. Are you taking any medications right now? Uh, no. Okay. And do you just go to Western? Do you live near campus with anyone? Uh, I have like a roommate. Yeah, we, I live in an apartment with a roommate. Okay. Have they been sick at all in the last little while? No. Okay. I had a last little while, have you done any traveling? No. So I haven't been outside the country or any exotic locales in the last little while? No. Like I'm planning to on March break, but I haven't gone anywhere. Got it. Got it. See, live in town, uh, with your roommate and you're calling a full-time student? Mm-hmm. Okay. And just regards anything. Do you smoke? Uh, no. Like I don't, um, I don't smoke cigarettes. Like sometimes, sometimes smoke marijuana that usually, um, usually it's like the vape. Okay. How fun do you say do that a week? Oh, like maybe like once every like two weeks or something. Got it. Any other substances? Flush drugs? No. Like alcohol sometimes. Like. Okay. So no cocaine, no heroin? No. And have you ever, um, injected drugs into your body? No. Got it. Got it. Let's come back to alcohol. Uh, how often would you say drink? Maybe like one, one night, like on the weekend. Okay. And what do you, how would you do drink? How much do you drink? I don't know. Maybe like five or six beers. I guess it just depends on the name. Got it. Got it. And other questions. One was your last menstrual period? Maybe like two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Okay. Are you sexually active? Uh, yeah, just with my boyfriend. Okay. So then and do you two use contraception? First control. Yeah, we use, uh, like condoms. Okay. Any chance you can be pregnant right now? That's a strange question to ask if you're sexually active, but any unprotected sex in the last two weeks? No. Got it. All right. And we'll just kind of going over things. So it sounds like you've had this cough or a cough for a little while, but it's only become bad in the last three days. You're waking up at night and you're kind of bringing up this foul or not this foul, but this kind of greenish spewed on, but it's no blood in it. And otherwise you don't have any constitutional symptoms. So I will go review your story with the doctors or anything else you'd like to bring up with them before I go. I don't think so. I just like, I like, I hope I just can feel better because I've been missing like my exercise stuff because I feel like it's like coughing and it makes it hard to like do well. Got it. Got it. We'll see what we can do. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Thanks.",
