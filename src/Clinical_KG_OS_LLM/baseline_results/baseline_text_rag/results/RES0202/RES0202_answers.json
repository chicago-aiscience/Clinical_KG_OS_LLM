So I just brought in my son he's 5. Essentially, when he, so today is Friday when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he I don’t know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick. So he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Then yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, uh sorry. Today, today is Friday. He was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today, what was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember it was it was. It was like over 100 though.\n[D-2] D: Oh OK.\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-2 to D-3) ---\n[D-2] D: Oh OK.\n[P-2] P: Uh, 101 or something or maybe 100.1 if. But anyways it was so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know so he could have maybe got covid and like at school or something.\n[D-3] D: Yeah for sure. Um OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five five days.\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-3 to D-4) ---\n[D-3] D: Yeah for sure. Um OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five five days.\n[P-3] P: Mhm.\n[D-4] D: OK, OK so let's focus on the cough.\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-6 to D-7) ---\n[D-6] D: OK, And. He is he. He's not bringing up any sputum or blood?\n[P-6] P: No.\n[D-7] D: No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-8 to D-9) ---\n[D-8] D: OK, how about short of breath?\n[P-8] P: Um I don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has. He hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple of days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing. But also I think he's just been tired in general.\n[D-9] D: OK, yeah. OK, Uhm. Is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night, in the morning?\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-12 to D-13) ---\n[D-12] D: OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?\n[P-12] P: I think so 'cause yeah, the first day he just seemed like a little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever.\n[D-13] D: OK, and is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-13 to D-14) ---\n[D-13] D: OK, and is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?\n[P-13] P: No, I don't think so.\n[D-14] D: No, OK. Does he have a sore throat?\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-14 to D-15) ---\n[D-14] D: No, OK. Does he have a sore throat?\n[P-14] P: Mm I don't think so.\n[D-15] D: OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-44 to D-45) ---\n[D-44] D: Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?\n[P-44] P: Yeah, sounds good.\n[D-45] D: OK great yeah, yeah no worries and. I I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but um right now it sounds like it sounds like an infection.\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-45 to D-46) ---\n[D-45] D: OK great yeah, yeah no worries and.

The doctor also acknowledged the possibility of false-negative results and noted that if the COVID swab returned negative, it could be another viral illness going around [D-44]. No medications were prescribed; the approach was supportive and observational, with the doctor stating he would wait for the COVID swab results [D-44].

Or feeling like his heart's racing?\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-26 to D-27) ---\n[D-26] D: OK, any confusion or memory loss?\n[P-26] P: No.\n[D-27] D: And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-27 to D-28) ---\n[D-27] D: And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?\n[P-27] P: Yeah, actually he hasn't decided to like a vaccine that he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever like.

Has he been around any sick contacts recently?\n[P-38] P: Not, not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school, um but he goes to school right now so. Kinda hard to say.\n[D-39] D: OK.\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-41 to D-42) ---\n[D-41] D: No OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?\n[P-41] P: I don't think so. Um, like I, I realized that I can often times like you don't really do much for kids when you know when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess need to have a covid test to go back to the school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say.

He was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today, what was it? My thermometer says it was high.

Um OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five five days.\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-8 to D-9) ---\n[D-8] D: OK, how about short of breath?\n[P-8] P: Um I don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has. He hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple of days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing. But also I think he's just been tired in general.\n[D-9] D: OK, yeah. OK, Uhm. Is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day?
