    "gold_answer": "In [D-39], the doctor communicated a comprehensive management plan. The stated working diagnosis was \"most likely a viral infection like the common cold\" based on the stuffy and runny nose presentation. Supportive care recommendations included: (1) stay \"well hydrated,\" and (2) use over-the-counter medications \"like Tylenol Cold\" to relieve symptoms. The doctor set expectations that symptoms can take \"a few weeks\" to fully resolve and acknowledged there was not much beyond supportive care available for a viral infection. For diagnostic testing, given the pandemic context and symptom overlap with COVID-19, the doctor ordered a COVID \"swab\" to be performed \"today,\" with results expected within \"48 hours\" [D-39]. For public health guidance, the doctor instructed the patient to \"stay isolated in your own home and not see anyone else\" while awaiting results [D-39]. After results return, the patient would receive \"further instructions from public health\" [D-39].",

    "gold_answer": "The patient's nasal symptoms began approximately one week prior to the visit [P-1, P-2]. The initial presenting symptom was nasal congestion: the nose \"felt pretty stuffy at first\" [P-3]. Over the course of the week, the predominant symptom shifted from congestion to rhinorrhea, with the patient reporting \"now it's mostly running\" [P-3]. This transition may have been partially influenced by the patient's use of over-the-counter decongestants, which the patient felt helped \"a little bit\" with the congestion [P-10]. Regarding pattern, the patient initially described the stuffy nose as \"on and off\" in the opening description [P-1], but when the doctor specifically asked whether symptoms were constant or came and went [D-8], the patient clarified the symptoms had been \"pretty constant for the past week\" [P-8]. This suggests that despite some perceived fluctuation early on, overall symptoms persisted continuously throughout the week.
