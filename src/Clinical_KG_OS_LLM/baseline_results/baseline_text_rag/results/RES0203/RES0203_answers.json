    "gold_answer": "The patient reported three symptoms: decreased sense of smell, loss of taste, and a mild dry cough, all present for two days [P-1, P-2]. The smell loss was partial rather than complete — the patient stated \"The smell isn't totally gone\" and could still detect very strong, unpleasant odors (\"if it smells really really bad\") [P-4]. The taste loss was also partial: the patient could still perceive \"really, really salty foods\" but could not taste \"normal things,\" giving the specific example of being unable to taste a banana [P-4]. Both sensory deficits had been \"pretty consistent\" over the two-day period rather than intermittent or fluctuating [P-5]. The cough was described as mild and dry [P-1], confirmed non-productive with no sputum or blood [P-7, D-7], and had remained consistent in severity without worsening [P-8]. The cough started at the same time as the sensory symptoms [P-6]. No triggers for the cough were identified [P-21].",

The management plan included: (1) A COVID-19 test ordered via a swab (\"we would do a swab\") [D-39]. (2) Self-isolation instructions: the patient must isolate immediately and continue until results return, and potentially longer if results are negative but symptoms persist [D-39].

None of the symptoms were described as intermittent or variable. The partial nature of the sensory losses persisted throughout: the patient could still smell very strong odors and taste very salty foods but not typical flavors such as banana [P-4]. Importantly, the patient had never experienced anything like these symptoms before, stating \"no, nothing like this\" [D-3, P-3]. This acute, simultaneous onset of sensory loss and dry cough over a two-day period, with no prior history of similar episodes, is the pattern the doctor identified as \"consistent with some common covid symptoms\" [D-39].",
