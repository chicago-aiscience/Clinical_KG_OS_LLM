Resolved symptoms include: sore throat for the first two to three days [P-13], runny nose in the first couple of days [P-14], and a productive cough with 'whitish clear' mucus for the first four to five days [P-6]. The patient characterized these early symptoms collectively as 'flu symptoms' that all resolved within three to four days except the cough [P-14]. Currently persisting symptoms include: a dry cough since around day four or five [P-5, P-6], occurring approximately three to four times per hour [P-9], spontaneous with no identifiable triggers [P-10], and stable in both intensity [P-7] and frequency [P-8]. The patient also reports chest soreness associated with excessive coughing, though denying independent chest pain [P-15, P-16]. Pertinent negatives explicitly denied include: difficulty breathing [P-11], fevers [P-12], nausea or vomiting [P-19], and abdominal pain [P-20].

The patient noted that coworkers are 'scared at work when I cough' [P-35], highlighting social and occupational pressure to rule out COVID-19. The patient also reported wearing PPE at work and being 'very careful' [P-17], though this did not preclude the need for testing.

The test was performed at the onset of symptoms approximately two weeks prior to the consultation, as the patient stated: 'I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago' [P-36].

Since testing negative, the patient has been staying home waiting for symptoms to resolve, expressing eagerness to return to work but not wanting to be coughing when they go back [P-36].

    "question_type": "risk_factors",
    "gold_answer": "The transcript documents three factors potentially relevant to the persistent cough. First, acid reflux [P-22] is managed only through dietary avoidance of acidic foods and chocolates [P-25] without any medication [P-23]; the patient reports this has helped 'quite a bit' [P-25], but the absence of pharmacologic treatment means reflux may not be fully controlled, and reflux is a recognized contributor to persistent cough. Second, hay fever [P-27] indicates a history of airway sensitivity and allergic response; however, the transcript does not describe current allergy symptoms or any active allergic contribution to the cough. Third, as a hospital clerk [P-34] who works in an environment with potential infectious exposures, the patient has occupational risk for acquiring respiratory infections, though they report wearing PPE and being 'very careful' [P-17]. Notably, the patient's initial illness presented with classic flu-like symptoms that resolved in three to four days [P-14], while the cough alone persisted, suggesting a post-viral pattern. The patient's anxiety history [P-22] and distress over coworkers being 'scared' when they cough [P-35] also provide context for their motivation to seek medical attention.",

    "question_type": "clinical_plan",
    "gold_answer": "At the end of the consultation, the doctor outlined a multi-step plan [D-37]. First, the physical examination components specifically mentioned were auscultation of the heart and lungs ('I'm gonna have a quick listen to your heart and lungs') and a quick physical exam. Second, following the examination, the doctor described a collaborative process: they would consult with the supervising physician ('I will go get the doctor that I'm working with'), review everything discussed during the consultation ('go over everything you talked about'), and then return together to discuss the assessment and determine next steps ('we'll come back and talk to you about where to go from here'). This structure was foreshadowed at the beginning of the encounter [D-1], where the doctor explained they would chat with the patient, review findings with the physician they are working with, and then reconvene. The patient agreed to this plan [P-37]. Notably, the doctor did not provide any diagnosis or prescribe medication at this stage, consistent with a learner or trainee consulting a supervising physician before finalizing clinical decisions. The transcript ends before any exam findings, diagnostic conclusions, or treatments are shared.",

During the first two to three days, the patient experienced sore throat [P-13] and runny nose [P-14], along with a productive cough, described collectively as 'flu symptoms' [P-14]. The sore throat resolved after two to three days [P-13], and the runny nose and other flu symptoms resolved within three to four days [P-14]. The productive cough produced 'whitish clear' mucus for the first four to five days [P-6]. After approximately day four or five, the cough transitioned to a dry cough [P-5, P-6], which has persisted since. The cough intensity has remained 'kind of the same' throughout [P-7], without worsening. Frequency has also remained stable [P-8], estimated at three to four times per hour [P-9], occurring spontaneously with no identifiable triggers [P-10]. No fevers occurred at any point [P-12]. At the time of consultation, the only remaining symptom is the persistent dry cough with occasional cough-related chest soreness [P-15, P-16]. A COVID test at symptom onset was negative [P-35, P-36], and the patient has been home awaiting resolution before returning to work [P-36].",
