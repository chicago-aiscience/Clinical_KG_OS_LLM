    "question_type": "symptom_recall",
    "gold_answer": "The 26-year-old patient presents with chest discomfort lasting approximately one and a half weeks [P-2, D-3]. The patient initially describes the sensation as not exactly pain but rather something 'very uncomfortable' and 'odd' [P-2], though later clarifies it is a 'very sharp, strong pain' occurring specifically when taking a deep breath [P-3]. Episodes last roughly 20 minutes each and recur intermittently throughout the day, coming on 'here and there' rather than remaining constant [P-6, P-7, D-7, D-9]. The pain tends to occur when the patient is alone -- specifically while walking to school or sitting and studying alone [P-4, P-29]. Notably, the pain tends to resolve or go unnoticed when engaged with other people, such as talking to classmates, working on hands-on tasks, or doing other activities at school [P-9, P-29]. The doctor confirms the pain can occur at rest [D-11, P-11]. The patient denies worsening with exercise, noting walking to school 'stays the same' and having not done strenuous exercise recently due to schoolwork [P-10]. No preceding injury or accident is reported [P-5], and the pain had no prior occurrence before this episode [P-17].",

While not a medication, the patient mentioned usually managing stress through leisure reading at night and running a few times a week, but has been 'a little bit nervous' to run lately [P-28].

    "question": "Considering that the patient's chest pain occurs predominantly when alone (walking to school or studying by herself) and tends to resolve when she is distracted or engaged with other people, and given her history of anxiety attacks as a teenager and current heightened academic stress, what diagnosis do these combined findings point toward, and which specific clinical observations from the consultation support this reasoning?",
    "question_type": "diagnostic_reasoning",
    "gold_answer": "These combined findings strongly point toward anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain. Several observations support this. First, the situational pattern: pain occurs when the patient is 'alone kind of with my thoughts' -- walking to school or studying -- and resolves when distracted by social interaction, working with classmates, or hands-on tasks [P-4, P-9, P-29]. Second, the patient has a history of anxiety attacks as a teenager discussed with a family doctor, though untreated for about eight years, and acknowledges they 'could maybe' return [P-21, P-22]. Third, the patient is under significant stress from a Masters thesis deadline and time pressure, which is explicitly linked to symptoms [P-13, P-15, P-16]. Fourth, during episodes the patient 'makes herself nervous' and 'starts breathing faster,' though denies intrinsic breathing difficulty, and notes 'it's hard to get a deep breath' because of nervousness [P-19]. Fifth, the patient considers stress as a possible cause [P-8]. Sixth, pertinent negatives support this over cardiac or pulmonary pathology: no fevers [P-12], no exertional worsening [P-10], pain occurs at rest [D-11, P-11], no palpitations outside anxiety episodes [P-20], and no asthma [P-23, P-24].",

    "question": "How do the patient's family history of early cardiac events (father's heart attack in his 50s), her personal smoking history, and her current psychosocial stressors each contribute to and interact with her concern about heart disease, and what details from the consultation illustrate these connections?",
    "question_type": "risk_factors",
    "gold_answer": "The patient's concern about heart disease is driven by three converging factors. First, family history: the father had a heart attack 'last year' while 'pretty young' in his 50s and now sees 'a lot of heart doctors' [P-8, P-30]. The patient explicitly states this 'scares' her and worries it could be a 'heart thing' [P-8]. The paternal grandfather died young in an accident, so cardiac history beyond the father is unknown [P-30]. Second, smoking as a concern: the patient began around age 18, escalated to about 10 cigarettes per day for two years, and recently cut down to approximately 5 per day while finding quitting 'kind of hard' amid school demands [P-13, P-14, P-18]. Third, psychosocial stressors: finishing a Masters in social work under intense thesis deadline pressure [P-15, P-16], living alone in London [P-26, P-27], and being nervous about running lately [P-28]. The patient connects these factors -- acknowledging the pain might be stress-related but uncertain [P-8], becoming nervous during episodes and breathing faster [P-19], and noting anxiety attacks from teenage years may be returning [P-22].",

A few months ago, the patient began cutting down to approximately 5 per day while finding quitting difficult amid school demands [P-14, P-18]. Around this period, the father had a heart attack in his 50s, instilling fear about cardiac disease [P-8, P-30]. The patient is now finishing a Masters in social work; over the 'last couple of weeks,' stress intensified due to a 'time crunch' to finish the thesis [P-15, P-16]. Approximately one and a half weeks ago, chest pain first appeared -- a symptom never experienced before [P-2, P-3, P-17].
