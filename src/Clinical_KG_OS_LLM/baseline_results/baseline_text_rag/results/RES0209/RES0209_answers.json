    "question_type": "symptom_recall",
    "gold_answer": "The 10-year-old patient with known asthma (D-3, P-3) reported four key symptoms. First, a persistent dry cough lasting approximately two weeks (P-1, P-13, P-14), described as \"almost nonstop throughout the day\" (P-1), with the doctor confirming it was not productive by asking about \"bringing up gunk\" before confirming \"dry cough\" (D-15). Second, significant breathing difficulty: feeling \"very short of breath\" (P-1) and having a \"hard time breathing\" during episodes (D-19, P-19), particularly when wheezing becomes severe (P-16). Third, prominent wheezing — the patient stated they have been \"wheezing a lot\" (P-15), and the clinician confirmed that wheezing episodes occur even more frequently than bronchodilator use (D-17, P-17). Fourth, the patient confirmed chest tightness when asked by the doctor (D-20, P-20). Regarding daytime versus nighttime frequency, daytime symptoms are more prominent and near-constant (P-1), while nighttime symptoms occur less often — approximately \"every other day\" or \"every two days or so\" (P-18). The patient explicitly stated nighttime symptoms \"don't happen as much as my daytime symptoms\" (P-18).",

    "question_type": "treatment_inventory",
    "gold_answer": "The patient's sole asthma medication is a bronchodilator (rescue inhaler), used on an as-needed basis (D-4, P-4) and administered via a \"puffer\" (P-7, D-7). The patient explicitly denied taking any other medications (D-6, P-6; D-30, P-30). The clinician specifically asked whether the patient has a medication taken \"every day no matter what\" — referring to a daily controller or maintenance medication (D-5) — and the patient confirmed they do not have one (P-5). The clinician restated that the patient \"just [has] the one that you take as needed,\" reinforcing the rescue-only regimen (D-6). This is clinically significant because the patient's dramatically increased rescue inhaler use — from once every two weeks to five or six times per week (P-8) — suggests the current treatment strategy is insufficient. The clinician alluded to this at the visit's end, suggesting \"a little change to your medications\" to \"better control your asthma\" (D-43), implying the possible addition of a daily controller medication.",

    "question": "Which combination of symptoms — specifically the dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness — along with the dramatic increase in bronchodilator use from once every two weeks to five or six times per week, point toward a worsening of this patient's asthma rather than a new respiratory condition?",
    "question_type": "diagnostic_reasoning",
    "gold_answer": "Several factors support worsening of existing asthma rather than a new respiratory condition. The symptom profile — dry cough (P-1, P-14), shortness of breath (P-1, P-19), wheezing (P-15), and chest tightness (P-20) — represents classic asthma symptoms in a patient with a confirmed diagnosis since age eight (P-2, D-3). The bronchodilator provides relief (P-1), consistent with reversible airway obstruction. Rescue inhaler use escalated dramatically from approximately once every two weeks to five or six times per week (P-8), and wheezing occurs even more frequently than bronchodilator use (D-17, P-17), indicating worsening symptom burden. Symptoms are exacerbated by known asthmatic triggers including exercise and cold air (P-9, P-11). Importantly, the clinician screened for infectious etiologies: the patient denied recent colds or infections (P-21), sick contacts at home or elsewhere (P-22, P-23), travel (P-24), loss of taste or smell (P-25), fevers (P-26), nausea or vomiting (P-27), abdominal pain (P-28), and productive cough (D-15, P-14). This combination in a known asthma patient, with increased reliance on a reliever that provides benefit, supports an asthma exacerbation requiring medication adjustment (D-43).",

When asked about other triggers, the patient reported none (D-10, P-10). The spring pollen trigger prompted the clinician to ask about allergies (D-12); the patient suspected allergies but had never been formally diagnosed (P-12), and the clinician responded \"that would make sense\" (D-13). The clinician revisited this later (D-31), with the patient denying knowledge of any other allergies (P-31). Regarding family history, the patient reported a sister with asthma (D-32, P-32), though no other family members had breathing problems (P-33) or known allergies (P-34). These triggers and the family history of asthma are relevant context for the current exacerbation, in which rescue inhaler use escalated from once every two weeks to five or six times per week (P-8).

I guess no, no big changes there. I find the cold air makes it worse like winter makes it worse or like. Yeah, maybe also the spring spring with like pollen and stuff like that.\n[D-12] D: OK, so you have allergies too?\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-12 to D-13) ---\n[D-12] D: OK, so you have allergies too?\n[P-12] P: I think, so I haven't ever been like formally diagnosed.\n[D-13] D: OK, I see I see. Yeah, that would make sense. No. OK, uh, so you say you've had more coughing lately, is that right? You said the last two weeks.\nOr the last week\n\n--- Chunk (turns D-28 to D-29) ---\n[D-28] D: Any belly pain?\n[P-28] P: No.\n[D-29] D: We just ask those questions because sometimes these things can happen with an infection or after an infection and we just want to make sure that that's not, you know what's happening right now.

    "gold_answer": "The clinician outlined a multi-step plan. First, diagnostic testing: the clinician stated they would \"probably will do a COVID swab just because of the times that we're living in right now\" (D-29), despite all infectious screening yielding negative answers. Second, medication changes: the clinician suggested that \"maybe all you need is a little change to your medications and maybe it will be better be able to better control your asthma\" (D-43). This is notable given the patient currently only has a rescue bronchodilator (P-5) and its use has increased dramatically (P-8). The clinician also expressed the goal that the patient should be able to play sports without needing medication every time (D-42). Third, consultation with the supervising physician: the clinician explicitly stated they would \"go talk to the doctor and tell him everything or her everything that you said\" (D-43), indicating this interview was conducted by a trainee or medical student who needed to present the case. They would then return together to see the patient shortly (D-43, D-44). The clinician had also earlier referenced needing to ask more questions \"before I go talk to the doctor\" (D-29).",

    "question": "How did this patient's asthma symptoms and bronchodilator usage evolve over time, from the initial diagnosis at age eight through the baseline period of using the bronchodilator once every two weeks, to the current two-week exacerbation with near-daily use five to six times per week?",
    "question_type": "temporal_progression",
    "gold_answer": "The transcript reveals a clear temporal progression. The patient was diagnosed with asthma at age eight (P-2) and is now ten years old (D-3, P-3), giving a two-year disease history. During the baseline period, asthma appeared relatively well controlled: the rescue bronchodilator was needed only \"maybe once every two weeks or so\" (P-8), described as \"not very often.\" Triggers during this period included exercise (gym and recess) and cold air (P-9), with some seasonal worsening in winter and spring (P-11). Then, over the past two weeks (P-13) — the patient initially said \"past week or so\" (P-1) but later clarified \"last two weeks\" — a significant exacerbation developed. The dry cough became near-nonstop throughout the day (P-1), wheezing increased substantially (P-15), and the patient reported shortness of breath (P-1, P-19) and chest tightness (P-20). Bronchodilator use escalated dramatically to \"almost everyday like five six times a week\" (P-8). Notably, wheezing episodes exceed even the frequency of bronchodilator use, as the patient only uses it when breathing becomes very difficult (P-16, P-17). Nighttime symptoms also appeared, occurring every other day or every two days (P-18). No clear precipitant was identified, as infectious causes were screened for and denied (P-21 through P-28).",
