  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient missed Keppra due to a disrupted dinner routine on their daughter’s birthday (consistent with P-24) and links this missed dose to the seizure. It also correctly identifies the patient’s own statement in P-9 as evidence the patient recognized the link (\"I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have...\"). No incorrect facts compared with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the two central elements: (1) missed Keppra dose as the likely trigger and (2) explicit patient attribution in P-9. However, it omits several supporting nuances present in the Gold Answer: that the patient offered this attribution spontaneously/not in response to a direct adherence question (context of D-9 → P-9), that the patient noted seizures are usually infrequent (P-9) supporting the idea of a specific trigger, and that no clinician confirmation of causality is provided. Overall, it covers the core but not all reinforcing points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in the transcript: Keppra use (P-23), missed dose due to altered dinner routine for daughter’s birthday (P-24), and the patient’s causal attribution statement (P-9). No additional unsupported assertions are introduced.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by explaining how the missed dose connects to the seizure and citing the patient’s own words indicating they recognized the causal link. No irrelevant content."
