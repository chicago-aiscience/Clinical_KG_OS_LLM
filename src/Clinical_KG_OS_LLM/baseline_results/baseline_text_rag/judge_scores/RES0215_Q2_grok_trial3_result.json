  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states that the patient takes Reactine for seasonal allergies and no prescribed medications, citing transcript sections. These facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript (P-36, P-47), with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) no medications for current respiratory episodes, resolve on own [P-33,P-34]; (2) occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies [P-35,P-36]; (3) no prescribed medications [P-36,P-46,P-47]; (4) no antibiotics for past infections [P-16]. Generated covers (2) and (3), misses (1) and (4), approximately 50% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine and no prescribed meds are directly verifiable in the transcript (P-36 mentions Reactine OTC and no prescribed; P-47 confirms no regular meds). Citations reference D-36 and D-47 (doctor's lines preceding patient confirmations in P-36/P-47), which are accurate in context with minor imprecision in labeling speaker turns, but no hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists the only medication (Reactine for allergies) and confirms no prescribed meds, addressing the question about medications for current/other conditions and prescribed management; no off-topic content."
