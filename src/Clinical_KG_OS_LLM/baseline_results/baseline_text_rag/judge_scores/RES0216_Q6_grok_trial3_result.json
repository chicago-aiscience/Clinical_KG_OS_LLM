  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the doctor's assessment that asthma is likely recurring at the top of the differential, directly matching D-35 ('asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential'), and notes cardiac ischemia is less likely, consistent with D-36. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer; all stated facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) assessment as asthma top pending exam/findings; (2) physical exam (quick exam, listen to lungs, further investigations); (3) initial treatment (rescue puffers as therapeutic trial on walks); (4) contingency (if no improvement, reassess other directions); (5) stepwise one-at-a-time approach; (6) consult supervising doc. Covered: partial assessment (asthma top, cardiac lower). Missed: pending exam part of assessment, all physical exam details, initial treatment details, contingency, stepwise, consult. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript: asthma top of differential (D-35), cardiac lower (D-36). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or inaccurate citations implied. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly begins addressing the question with structured 'Assessment' matching the query's 'overall assessment,' and implies plan structure, but abruptly truncates without covering clinical plan components (exam, treatment, contingency), making it only partially responsive to the full question."
