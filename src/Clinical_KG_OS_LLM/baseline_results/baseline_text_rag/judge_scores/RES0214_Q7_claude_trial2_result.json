  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence with 'the patient's symptoms began' and provides no actual information about the chronological progression. It cannot be evaluated for factual accuracy since it contains no substantive content to compare against the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) stuffy nose as first symptom, (2) sore throat development, (3) fever for three days, (4) muscle aches concurrent with fever, (5) husband's symptoms for past week, (6) husband's illness starting ~4 days before patient's fever, or (7) the household transmission pattern. The answer is essentially non-existent.",
    "faithfulness": "Since the Generated Answer contains no substantive claims, it cannot be evaluated for faithfulness to the transcript. It makes no statements that could be verified or refuted against the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer begins to address the question ('the patient's symptoms began') but provides no actual answer. It shows intent to be relevant but fails to deliver any relevant content due to being incomplete."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is completely inadequate, consisting only of an incomplete sentence fragment that provides no information about the chronological progression of symptoms, timeline, or comparison to the husband's illness. It fails on all evaluation dimensions due to being essentially non-existent rather than merely incorrect or incomplete."
