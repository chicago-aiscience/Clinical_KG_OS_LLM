  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab, the 14-day isolation period, the condition for contact tracing (positive result), and all supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, and specific medications).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all aspects of the gold answer. It misses the 24-48 hour expected turnaround time for the test results and the mention of an alternative diagnosis (other viral illness) if the test is negative, which were included in the gold answer's description of the management plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, with every claim directly supported by section D-52. There are no hallucinations or external medical advice added beyond what the doctor stated.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, addressing each specific component requested by the prompt (test, duration, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care) without including unnecessary information."
