  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out and the COVID swab as the test, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-43]. The detail about social contacts (meeting a sick friend while walking dogs, getting too close) is factually correct per [P-20], with no contradictions or errors, though less detailed than Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: condition (COVID-19), test (swab), core social contact detail [P-20]. Missed: specifics like 'couple of friends', 'felt too safe outside', doctor's question about friend's COVID test [D-21/P-21], screenings for smell/taste/confusion/aches [P-32-35], travel denial [P-31], and rationale despite absent symptoms. Covers ~50-60% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: COVID-19 and swab from [D-43]; social contacts paraphrase accurately from [P-20] without addition or fabrication. Citations precise, fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers all three question parts (condition, test, prompting social detail) with no off-topic content."
