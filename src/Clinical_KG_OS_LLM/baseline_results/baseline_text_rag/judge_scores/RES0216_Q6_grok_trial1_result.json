  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the doctor suspects asthma recurring as the top differential and considers cardiac ischemia less likely, which aligns fully with the Gold Answer and transcript (D-35 for asthma, D-36 for cardiac lower on differential due to no pain/out-of-breath with exercise). No factual errors or contradictions in the provided content.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) assessment (asthma top of differential, pending exam/findings); (2) physical exam (quick exam, listen to lungs, possible further investigations); (3) initial intervention (rescue puffers trial during walks); (4) contingency (if no improvement, reassess other directions); (5) stepwise approach and consult doc. Generated covers only ~20% (partial assessment), misses all plan components entirely.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: asthma recurring top differential [D-35], cardiac ischemia less likely [D-36]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly begins addressing the question by outlining assessment and plan structure, matching the question's focus, but abruptly truncates after assessment without covering required plan elements (exam, intervention, contingency), making it only partially responsive with no off-topic content."
