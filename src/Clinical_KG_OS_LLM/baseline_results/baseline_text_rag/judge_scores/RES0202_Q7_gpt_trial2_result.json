  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states that on Wednesday the child “seemed fine” and then developed a dry cough. This matches the transcript/gold in substance: the parent reported he seemed fine when he got home from school Wednesday and developed a “little dry cough” that night (P-1). Minor wording discrepancy: it says “seemed fine at school” rather than “when he got home from school,” but the key clinical fact (onset of dry cough Wednesday night after appearing well) is correct.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer includes a 3-day timeline: Wednesday evening cough onset; Thursday cough persisted/worsened with fatigue; Friday cough worsened further with new fever (>100F) plus decreased appetite/possible loss of taste and mild runny nose, and notes the correction from 5 days to 3 days. The Generated Answer covers only the Wednesday cough onset and omits Thursday and Friday progression, fever timing/temperature, fatigue, appetite/taste change, runny nose, and the 3-day correction. This is well under 20% of required details.",
    "faithfulness": "The single claim included (appeared well then developed a dry cough on Wednesday) is supported by the transcript (P-1). The only slight concern is the phrase “fine at school” vs “fine when he got home from school,” which is not explicitly stated; otherwise it is grounded and does not introduce new unsupported symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for the day-by-day evolution from Wednesday evening through Friday, including when cough started, how it changed over three days, and when fever/fatigue/decreased appetite emerged. The Generated Answer addresses only the first part (Wednesday cough onset) and does not address the requested progression or emergence of other symptoms."
