  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately restates that the child has seasonal allergies and has had recurrent viral infections over the past two years, and that wheeze/SOB occur with activity. These elements are consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer. However, it does not provide the key clinical interpretation (atopic predisposition/airway hyperresponsiveness with exercise/cold triggers) and it cites “D-35/D-15” rather than the patient lines (P-35/P-15), which is a minor referencing issue rather than a major factual error.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) seasonal allergies, (2) recurrent viral infections, (3) exercise-related symptoms (partially).\nKey points missed: connection of these factors to an atopic/asthma phenotype; role of viral infections in airway inflammation/hyperresponsiveness; new carpets as potential indoor irritant/allergen source and lack of clear temporal link; cold weather as a bronchospasm trigger; additional environmental negatives (no smoke/pets/wood stove; filters changed); symptom pattern of resolution with rest and the overall synthesis tying all factors together. Overall coverage is well under 20% of required content.",
    "faithfulness": "All stated claims are grounded in the transcript (seasonal allergies, past viral infections, activity-associated wheeze/SOB). No clear hallucinations. The main issue is omission/truncation rather than fabrication, with minor line-label inaccuracies in citations.",
    "relevance": "What is written is on-topic (it discusses the same history elements and exercise-associated wheeze), but it does not actually answer how the listed factors collectively relate to the current pattern (no synthesis, and it ends mid-sentence)."
