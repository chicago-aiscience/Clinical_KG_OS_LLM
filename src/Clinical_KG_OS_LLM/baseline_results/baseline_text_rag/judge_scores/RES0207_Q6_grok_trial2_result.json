{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately paraphrases the doctor's statements from D-37 about reviewing with the other doctor and returning to discuss next steps, tests, and moving forward, with no factual errors or contradictions compared to the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: reviewing with the other doctor (who involved), returning shortly, discussing next steps/potential tests/how to move forward (types of actions). Missed: patient acknowledgment (P-37), explicit note that no specific tests/treatments named, interpretation of trainee/collaborative process, farewell (D-38), and emphasis on contingency—covers core elements but ~80-90% of Gold's details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in D-37 ('go over it with the doctor was working today', 'come back shortly and talk... next steps if there's any tests... or how we want to move forward'); accurate citation, no hallucination or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by specifying communicated next steps (review and discuss), who involved (other doctor), and follow-up types (tests, moving forward), with no off-topic content."
