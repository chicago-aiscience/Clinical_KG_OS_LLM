  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer provides accurate information about the timeline (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, discovery) and correctly compares the tick engorgement to the prior episode. However, it is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence, failing to fully address the local symptoms comparison. The facts stated are consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only partial key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions the Friday hiking and Saturday gardening, and addresses tick engorgement comparison, but is incomplete. It fails to mention: discovery timeline details (earlier today, back of knee soreness prompting inspection), the 72-hour attachment estimate, the plastic container detail, the bullseye rash comparison (prior episode had it, current does not), and the localized redness/tenderness without larger circle rash in current episode. Coverage is approximately 40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations to patient statements (P-1, P-3, D-4). No hallucinated content is present. The answer is grounded in the source material, though incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question's two main components: timeline of exposure and comparison to prior episode. However, due to incompleteness (cuts off mid-sentence), it only partially fulfills the relevance requirement. What is present is highly relevant but the answer fails to complete its response."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate information that is fully grounded in the transcript, correctly addressing the timeline of tick exposure and beginning the comparison to the prior episode. However, it is severely incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence and covering only 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses critical details about the discovery timeline, the 72-hour estimate, and the complete comparison of local symptoms (particularly the bullseye rash distinction). While what is present is correct and relevant, the incompleteness significantly impacts its utility as a comprehensive answer."
