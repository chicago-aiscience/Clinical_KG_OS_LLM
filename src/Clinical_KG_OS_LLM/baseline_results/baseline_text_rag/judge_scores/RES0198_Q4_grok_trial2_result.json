  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition (both patient and doctor), the swab test, 48-hour turnaround, and isolation instructions, matching the Gold Answer's facts; minor discrepancy in citing 'D-1' for patient's mention (actual [P-1]) and omitting 'COVID swab' specificity or 'today', but core facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) COVID-19 by both (patient [P-1], doctor [D-39]); (2) COVID swab today [D-39]; (3) 48 hours [D-39]; (4) isolate at home/not see others + public health instructions [D-39]. Covered: all four main points; missed: 'today', explicit 'COVID' for swab, 'further instructions from public health' (~85-90% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript ([P-1] for patient, [D-39] for doctor/test/time/instructions); minor citation error ('D-1' should be [P-1]); no hallucinations, fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured as bullet points directly answering the four-part question with no off-topic content or tangents."
