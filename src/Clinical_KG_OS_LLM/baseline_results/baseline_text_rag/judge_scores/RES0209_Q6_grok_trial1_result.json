  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: COVID-19 swab (D-29), suggestion of medication change (D-43), and consultation with supervising physician followed by return (D-43). No factual errors or contradictions; minor differences only in level of detail and explanatory context provided by Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic test (COVID swab), medication change suggestion (with citation), next steps (consultation and return). Missed: contextual details like negative infectious screening, rationale for medication change (patient's current rescue-only regimen and increased use), sports goal (D-42), explicit trainee status indication, and earlier consultation reference (D-29). Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: 'COVID-19 swab' from D-29, 'little change to your medications' from D-43, 'go talk to the doctor... come back and see you shortly' from D-43. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response around the three specified elements (diagnostic test in COVID context, medication regimen change, consultation next steps) with no off-topic content."
