No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) condition COVID-19 [D-43] - covered; (2) test COVID swab [D-43] - covered; (3) social contacts detail (friends walking dogs, one sick, too close) [P-20] - covered; (4) unsure if friend tested [P-21] - missed; (5) screening for COVID symptoms (smell/taste/confusion/aches) [P-32-35] - missed; (6) travel question [P-31] - missed. Covers core elements of the question (condition, test, main social detail) but omits supportive details on doctor's follow-up questions and screenings.",
