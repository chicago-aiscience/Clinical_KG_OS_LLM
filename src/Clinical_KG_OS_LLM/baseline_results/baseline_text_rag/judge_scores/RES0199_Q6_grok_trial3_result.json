  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the management plan from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the COVID-19 swab test, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and supportive care details like hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, and Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches. Minor discrepancies include omitting the 24-48 hour results timeframe, the alternative viral illness diagnosis, the 'if you get any' qualifier for fevers, and explicit statement of no prescription medications, but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic test (COVID swab, misses results timeframe), 14-day self-isolation, contact tracing if positive, supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fevers, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Missed: results expected in 24-48 hours, alternative diagnosis of another viral illness, explicit 'if you get any' for fevers, and 'no prescription medications beyond supportive'. Covers approximately 85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations. No hallucinated facts; phrasing closely matches the source (e.g., 'isolate for 14 days', 'public health will... contact tracing if positive', supportive care items verbatim). Minor stylistic differences (e.g., 'nsaids' lowercase) do not affect grounding.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured as a bullet-point list directly addressing each specified element of the question (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), with no off-topic content or tangents."
