  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main contributors described in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose due to disrupted routine) and (2) hereditary risk (epilepsy in the family, specifically mother). No contradictions or clinically incorrect statements relative to the Gold Answer. Minor citation imprecision: it attributes “diagnosis of epilepsy” to [P-9] whereas the explicit statement is at [P-8], though [P-9] is still about seizures/med adherence and does not change the factual content.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: missed Keppra dose; disruption due to daughter’s birthday; family history of epilepsy and mother affected; patient has epilepsy. Key points partially/omitted: explicit statement that hereditary history indicates genetic predisposition consistent with diagnosis; the patient’s own attribution that missing medication likely precipitated the seizure (“I think that might have” [P-9]); note that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent [P-9]. Overall captures the main risk factors but misses several supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript: missed dose due to birthday routine change [P-24]; Keppra use [P-23]; maternal epilepsy/family history [P-26]; epilepsy history is stated in the transcript (more directly at [P-8]). No hallucinated medications, family members, or additional risk factors.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question about hereditary and medication-related risk factors and links family history to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis. No irrelevant tangents."
