  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the three main components of the plan mentioned in the Gold Answer: COVID-19 testing, medication changes, and consultation with supervising physician. All facts align with the Gold Answer, though presented more concisely.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key elements from the Gold Answer (COVID test, medication changes, consultation). However, it lacks important contextual details present in the Gold Answer: the specific reasoning for the COVID test ('times we're living in'), the notation that patient currently only has rescue bronchodilator with dramatically increased use, the goal of playing sports without needing medication, and the explicit indication that the clinician is a trainee/medical student. Covers approximately 70% of the detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citation references (D-29, D-43). No hallucinated content present. The answer stays grounded in what was explicitly stated in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: diagnostic test (COVID swab), medication regimen changes, and consultation with supervising physician. Content is focused and on-topic with no irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually correct and highly relevant, accurately identifying all three main components of the clinical plan with proper citations. However, it lacks the contextual depth and supporting details present in the Gold Answer, such as the clinical reasoning behind decisions, the patient's current medication status, and the identification of the clinician as a trainee. The answer is concise and accurate but could be more complete."
