  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the COVID-19 swab was ordered (matches Gold: D-53), that both patient and husband should self-isolate/keep to themselves (matches Gold: D-53, D-54), and that the next step was a physical exam (matches Gold: D-52). The added phrase about “investigate/work up the symptoms further” is consistent with D-53 and does not contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) COVID swab ordered, (2) self-isolation for patient and husband/keep to themselves, (3) physical exam as next step. Missing from Gold Answer: (4) clinician stating they would go talk to the supervising doctor and come back (D-55), and (5) patient agreement to the plan (P-54).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript citations provided (D-52, D-53, D-54). No clear hallucinations. The “work up further” statement is a reasonable paraphrase of transcript language (“trying to investigate, work this up further”).",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question by summarizing the overall management plan, including the test ordered, isolation precautions for patient and husband, and immediate next steps."
