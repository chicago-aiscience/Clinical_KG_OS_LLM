  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition ruled out, directly quoting relevant details from P-28 (worked up, no shortness of breath or wheezing even during physical activity), which matches the Gold Answer's core facts without any factual errors or contradictions. Minor details like explicit mention of grandparents or doctor's acknowledgment are omitted but not misrepresented.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: asthma as condition (100%), mother's report of prior workup (100%), specific negatives (no shortness of breath, no wheezing even with physical activity) (100%). Missed: explicit family history in grandparents, doctor's question/acknowledgment (D-28/D-30), mother's conclusion 'he doesn't have that', patient's overall healthy history (P-24), and interpretive notes on absence being notable. Covers ~75% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in P-28 (asthma in grandparents/family, worked up, no SOB/wheezing even with activity). Citations (P-28) are accurate. No hallucinated facts or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly names the condition (asthma) and lists the exact symptoms not exhibited (shortness of breath, wheezing even during activity) as cited by the mother, perfectly addressing the question's focus without irrelevant content."
