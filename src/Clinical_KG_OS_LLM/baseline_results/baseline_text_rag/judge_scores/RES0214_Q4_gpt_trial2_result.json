  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the ordered test as a COVID swab (consistent with D-53) and correctly states the main rationale for prioritizing COVID-19: the husband had similar symptoms and the clinician explicitly said COVID would be the first thing to rule out in that context (D-53). No contradictory or false statements relative to the Gold Answer are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points: (1) COVID-19 swab ordered — covered. (2) Prioritization due to likely household transmission/epidemiologic context (husband symptomatic first) — partially covered (mentions husband similar symptoms, but not the temporal/household-transmission emphasis). (3) Self-isolation/containment rationale while awaiting rule-out — missed. (4) Influenza mentioned as a secondary possibility after COVID discussion and after noting no flu shot — missed. Overall, it captures the core reason but omits important supporting rationale/details from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript (COVID swab ordered; fever/sore throat presentation; husband with similar symptoms; clinician says COVID is first to rule out). No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (test ordered and rationale for prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza) without irrelevant content."
