  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes the cough onset timing with accurate citations (D-1, D-2), which aligns with transcript details referenced in Gold, but fails to discuss any of the three specified risk factors' details or their relations to the presentation, introducing no contradictions but omitting all core explanatory content from Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: smoking details (pack/day since 15, citations, relations to infection/COPD/cancer/cough/hemoptysis), occupational details (consultant at Sarnia plant, engineering side, safety measures, mitigated risk), family history (grandpa lung cancer/big smoker, genetic risk), collective relation (infection likely but malignancy vigilance). Generated covers 0% of these, only starting a smoking bullet with no content and extraneous cough timing.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated (cough started two days ago, citations D-1/D-2) are directly verifiable in transcript; no hallucinations or unverifiable details present.",
    "relevance": "Generated begins structuring response around elicited risk factors as asked but only starts the first bullet without content, includes irrelevant cough timing detail instead of focusing on risk factors' relations to presentation, making it partially on-topic but substantially incomplete."
