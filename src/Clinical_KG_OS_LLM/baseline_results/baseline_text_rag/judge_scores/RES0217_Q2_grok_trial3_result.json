  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the patient's current statin therapy (consistent with Gold [P-15] and transcript), proposes prophylactic antibiotics (matches Gold [D-6, D-13, D-18]), sending the tick to a lab (Gold/D-18), and blood work for serology (Gold/D-18). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer or transcript; minor citation variance (D-15 vs P-15) does not affect accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: current meds (cholesterol mgmt [P-14], statin [P-15]), no allergies [P-16/17], past tick bite antibiotics [P-3], new prophylactic antibiotics with details/rationale/no specifics/consult physician [D-6/13/18/22], environmental insecticide [D-18]. Covered: statin, prophylactic antibiotics, tick lab, blood work (~40-50% coverage, misses allergies, past history, cholesterol context, physician consult, insecticide, rationale details).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: statin confirmed in exchange [P-15/D-15], antibiotics prophylactic [D-6/D-18], tick to lab [D-6/D-18], blood work/serology [D-18]. Citations mostly accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications (statin, antibiotics) and treatments (prophylactic antibiotics, lab/blood tests) discussed for tick bite and current therapy; no off-topic content, perfectly focused on question."
