  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the patient takes Reactine for seasonal allergies and that no prescribed medications are involved. These facts are consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is incomplete. It fails to mention that the patient takes no medication for her current respiratory episodes (which resolve with rest), a key part of the question. It also misses details about the lack of antibiotics for past infections and the absence of regular medications.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript. However, the citations (D-36, D-47) refer to the doctor's turns where the questions were asked, while the parent's actual statements are in P-36 and P-47. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the topic of medications but only addresses half of the question's scope. It completely ignores the 'current respiratory episodes' part of the query."
