  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's inquiry about family history of respiratory problems [D-28] and the disclosure of grandparents' asthma [P-28], as well as the differentiation based on prior workup and absence of shortness of breath or wheezing even with activity [P-28], matching core facts in the Gold Answer; minor discrepancies include attributing the response to the 'patient' instead of specifying the mother and omitting the doctor's summary [D-30], but no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: doctor's inquiry [D-28], grandparents' asthma [P-28], differentiation via prior workup and absence of SOB/wheezing with activity [P-28]; missed points: clinical relevance to cough, doctor's summary [D-30], details of current dry non-productive cough [D-5,P-5,D-6,P-6], clear runny nose [D-11,P-11,D-12,P-12], absence of wheeze/exertional dyspnea explicitly contrasted, and prior shorter respiratory issues without dry cough [P-24], covering approximately 50-60% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: inquiry at D-28, grandparents' asthma and differentiation details at P-28; accurate citations with no hallucinated facts, though 'patient responded' loosely refers to P-28 (mom speaking).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: connection of grandparents' asthma to doctor's inquiry on respiratory history, and evidence from symptom profile (prior workup, no SOB/wheezing) differentiating from familial asthma; concise and focused with no off-topic content."
