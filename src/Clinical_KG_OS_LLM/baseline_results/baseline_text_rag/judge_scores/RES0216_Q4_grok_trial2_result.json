  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies 'cardiac ischemic picture' [D-36] as deprioritized. Generated correctly names it. Gold cites tightness vs. pain [P-5], no exertional dyspnea [D-36/P-7 nuance], absences: no pain [P-5], no anxiety/sweaty/doom [P-6/D-6]. Generated cites tightness vs. pain [P-1, accurate though different cite], no SOB on exercise [D-36 exact], no pain [D-36]. No factual errors, but misses key absences (anxiety etc.), minor discrepancy in pain cite (P-1 vs P-5, both support). Core facts match: 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: condition (covered), nature: tightness>pain (covered), tightness>exertional SOB (covered), absences: pain/anxiety/sweaty/doom (only pain covered), clinician screening (missed), patient relief (missed), combination rationale (implied). Covers condition fully, ~2/3 nature, 1/4 absences: ~60-70% coverage: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All Generated claims directly from transcript: condition [D-36], tightness not pain [P-1 verbatim support], no SOB exercise [D-36 exact], no pain [D-36 exact]. Citations precise, no unverifiable/hallucinated content: 5.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers question: names condition with citation, lists doctor-cited symptoms (nature: tightness/no pain/no SOB; absences: no pain). Focused, no tangents, addresses both required aspects (nature + some absences): 5."
