  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to be ruled out, the ordered test as a swab, the turnaround time as 48 hours, and the instruction to isolate at home and avoid others. The only factual/citation issue is that it says the patient mentioned COVID in “D-1,” when it was actually in P-1. This is a minor discrepancy in attribution rather than a substantive clinical error.",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 to be ruled out, (2) swab ordered today, (3) results in 48 hours, (4) isolate at home/avoid others while awaiting results, (5) further instructions from public health once results return. The Generated Answer includes (1), (2) (though not explicitly “today”), (3), and (4), but omits (5) the note about receiving further instructions from public health. Therefore it is mostly complete but not fully.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (D-39 and P-1). However, the answer incorrectly attributes the patient’s COVID concern to D-1 rather than P-1, which is not grounded in the transcript as written (a citation/turn-label error). No other clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers all components of the question (condition, test, turnaround time, and instructions) with no irrelevant content."
