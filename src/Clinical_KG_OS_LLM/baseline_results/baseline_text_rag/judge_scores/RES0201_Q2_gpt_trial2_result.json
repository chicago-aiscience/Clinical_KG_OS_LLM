  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient has mild COPD and is taking a long-acting beta agonist (matches [P-27], [P-28]). It also correctly reports the sore-throat self-treatments tried: salt-water gargles and painkillers (matches [P-6]). No incorrect medications or treatments are added.",
    "completeness": "Key items in the Gold Answer: (1) long-acting beta agonist for COPD, (2) takes a couple of vitamins, (3) tried salt-water gargles, (4) tried painkillers, plus the Gold Answer notes lack of relief and that no other therapies were mentioned. The Generated Answer includes (1), (3), and (4), but omits the vitamins and the detail that these measures did not help / nothing seems to be working. It also does not mention that these were the only meds. Overall, it captures most of the core medication/treatment elements but not all.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript citations provided ([P-28], [P-6]). No hallucinated treatments or medications are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments for chronic COPD management and self-treatment attempts for the sore throat, which directly answers the question without irrelevant additions."
