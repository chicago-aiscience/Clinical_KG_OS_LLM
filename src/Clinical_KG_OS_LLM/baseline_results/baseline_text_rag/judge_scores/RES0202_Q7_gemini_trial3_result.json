  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the child's status on Wednesday, matching the Gold Answer's mention of a dry cough. However, it fails to provide any information for the rest of the requested period.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete, covering less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It omits the cough's progression on Thursday and Friday, the emergence of the fever, fatigue, and decreased appetite.",

    "relevance": "The answer is largely off-topic because it does not provide the requested day-by-day evolution or address the specific symptoms and severity changes over the three-day window."
