  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incomplete, containing only the word 'Based' which provides no factual information to compare against the Gold Answer. There are no facts present to assess for accuracy or errors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention any of the resolved symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, productive cough with mucus), any of the persisting symptoms (dry cough, frequency, triggers, chest soreness), or any of the pertinent negatives (difficulty breathing, fevers, nausea, abdominal pain).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains only a single incomplete word that cannot be verified against the transcript. While it's not technically hallucinated content, it provides no substantive information to evaluate for grounding in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. The question asks for specific symptoms during the two-week illness, including resolved and current symptoms, but the response provides no information whatsoever about symptoms."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is entirely inadequate, consisting only of the incomplete word 'Based' with no substantive content. It fails completely across all evaluation dimensions: provides no factual information to assess correctness, covers none of the required key points about resolved and persisting symptoms, cannot be evaluated for faithfulness to the transcript due to lack of content, and does not address the clinical question in any way. This represents a complete failure to generate a meaningful response."
