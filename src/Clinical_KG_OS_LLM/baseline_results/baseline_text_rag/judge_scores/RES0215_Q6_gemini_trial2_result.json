    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding the details it provides. It accurately identifies the next steps from the transcript [D-58] and correctly notes the inquiry about air filters.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly incomplete regarding the environmental factors. While it lists all components of the doctor's plan (exam, consultation, follow-up), it misses several key environmental factors mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript: smoking [P-53], carpets [P-54], pets [P-55], wood-burning fireplaces/stoves [P-56], and the living situation [P-50]. It also omits the doctor's offer for the mother to ask questions.",

    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without including any unnecessary or off-topic information."
