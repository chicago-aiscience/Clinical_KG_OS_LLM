  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately states the test was negative. However, it contains a citation error - the patient's statements about being a hospital worker, colleagues' reactions, and the negative test are all from P-35 and P-36, not D-35 (which is a doctor's statement). The core facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main elements requested (diagnosis, evidence, test results) but provides minimal detail compared to the Gold Answer. It omits important context including: the timeline of testing (two weeks ago at symptom onset), flu-like symptoms as evidence, occupational exposure risk, PPE use, staying home since the test, and the patient's desire to return to work. It covers approximately 40-50% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript content, though the citations are incorrect (citing D-35 instead of P-35/P-34/P-36). The facts stated (hospital worker, colleagues scared, negative COVID test) are all verifiable in the transcript. No hallucinated information is present, just citation errors.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated (COVID-19), what evidence prompted it (hospital worker, colleagues' concern), and what testing revealed (negative). It stays focused without tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis with accurate test results, directly addressing the question. However, it provides minimal detail compared to the Gold Answer, omitting important contextual information about timing, symptom presentation, and occupational factors. While factually accurate and relevant, the answer lacks completeness in explaining the evidence that prompted investigation."
