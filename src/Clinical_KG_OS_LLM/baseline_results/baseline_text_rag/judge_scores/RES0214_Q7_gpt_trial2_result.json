  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is essentially a sentence fragment (“Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient's symptoms began”) and does not state any symptom sequence or timing. Because it provides no substantive clinical facts to compare with the Gold Answer (stuffy nose first, then sore throat, then fever x3 days, muscle aches x2–3 days, husband symptomatic x1 week), it fails to deliver the correct chronology.",
    "completeness": "It omits all key points from the Gold Answer: first symptom (stuffy nose), subsequent sore throat, onset/duration of fever (3 days), muscle aches timeline (2–3 days concurrent with fever), and comparison to husband’s earlier onset (1 week). Coverage is effectively 0%.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer makes no concrete claims beyond an unfinished lead-in, so it does not introduce hallucinated or contradictory details. While unhelpful, what is present is not ungrounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Although it appears to start addressing the question, it does not actually describe the chronological progression or compare to the husband’s timeline. Therefore it does not meaningfully answer the prompt."
