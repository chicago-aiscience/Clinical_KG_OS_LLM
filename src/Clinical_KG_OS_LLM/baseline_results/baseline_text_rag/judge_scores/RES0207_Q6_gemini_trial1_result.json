    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary requirements of the prompt (who is involved and follow-up actions). However, it is significantly less detailed than the gold answer, omitting the patient's agreement, the interpretation that the speaker is a trainee, and the mention of a courteous farewell.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is strictly grounded in the transcript (D-37). It does not introduce any hallucinations or outside information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and concise, focusing exclusively on answering the specific questions asked in the prompt without any tangential information."
