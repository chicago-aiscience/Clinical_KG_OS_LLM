  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and provides no actual content to evaluate against the Gold Answer. It begins with 'Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient's respiratory symptoms developed as follows' but contains no substantive information about the symptom development, triggers, patterns, or any of the key details present in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: the initial trigger (playing tag), the timeline (4-5 days), the initial symptoms (wheezing and difficulty breathing), the fluctuating episodic pattern, the emergence of cough, the single nocturnal episode, or any pertinent negatives. The answer is literally incomplete.",
    "faithfulness": "Cannot properly assess faithfulness as the Generated Answer contains no substantive claims to verify against the transcript. The introductory phrase is accurate but leads nowhere.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. While the opening phrase suggests an attempt to answer the question about symptom development, no actual information is provided. The question asks specifically about how symptoms developed and changed, including trigger, pattern, cough emergence, and nocturnal episode - none of which are addressed."
