  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists Ventolin and Spiriva as current respiratory inhalers, correctly notes Ventolin use as almost 10 times in the past week, and identifies the diuretic (blood pressure medication) as the one discontinued without doctor approval; all stated facts match the Gold Answer and transcript with no contradictions or errors, though it omits atorvastatin.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) Ventolin and Spiriva inhalers (covered), (2) Ventolin ~10 times/week (covered), (3) atorvastatin for cholesterol (missed), (4) discontinued diuretic without approval (covered); covers 3 out of 4 key points (75-80%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript (Ventolin/Spiriva in P-11, Ventolin use in P-12, diuretic discontinuation in P-35/P-36); citations reference adjacent doctor utterances (D-11/D-12/D-35/D-36) rather than exact patient responses, but no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by listing prior respiratory inhalers, Ventolin frequency, non-respiratory context implicitly via discontinued med, and the discontinued medication, with no off-topic content."
