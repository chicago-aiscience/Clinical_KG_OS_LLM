  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the test ordered (COVID swab) and the doctor's stated reasoning from the transcript (fever, sore throat, and husband's symptoms). It matches the facts presented in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary rationale (household transmission and clinical presentation) but misses the supporting context mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the self-isolation instructions and the fact that influenza was only considered as a secondary possibility after checking the flu shot status.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript, specifically referencing speaker turn D-53. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the specific test and the rationale for prioritization."
