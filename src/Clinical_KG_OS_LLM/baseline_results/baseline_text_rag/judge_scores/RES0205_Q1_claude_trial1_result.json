  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete, consisting only of the word 'Based' which provides no factual content to compare against the Gold Answer. Since it fails to present any medical information, symptoms, timeline, or clinical details, it cannot be evaluated for factual accuracy. This represents a complete failure to address the clinical question.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention any of the resolved symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, productive cough with mucus), any of the persisting symptoms (dry cough, frequency, triggers, chest soreness), the timeline of symptom evolution, or any of the pertinent negatives. The response is essentially non-existent.",
    "faithfulness": "The single word 'Based' cannot be evaluated for faithfulness as it makes no claims about the transcript content. There is no hallucination because there is no content, but equally there is no grounding in the source material. This represents a complete absence of response rather than unfaithful content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. The question asks for specific symptoms during a two-week illness, including both resolved and persisting symptoms. The incomplete word 'Based' provides no information about symptoms, timeline, or clinical presentation, making it completely irrelevant to the clinical query."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and non-functional, consisting only of the word 'Based' without any substantive content. It fails completely across all evaluation dimensions: it provides no factual information to assess correctness, covers none of the required content for completeness, offers nothing to evaluate for faithfulness, and does not address the clinical question at all for relevance. This represents a total failure to generate an appropriate clinical response."
