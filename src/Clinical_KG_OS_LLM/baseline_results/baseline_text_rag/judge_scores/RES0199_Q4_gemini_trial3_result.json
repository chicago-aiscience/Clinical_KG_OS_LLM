  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab as the test, the 24-48 hour window for results, and 'another viral illness' as the alternative diagnosis. These facts are perfectly aligned with the Gold Answer and the transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses all four specific parts of the user's question. However, compared to the Gold Answer, it omits several key clinical points mentioned there: the instruction to isolate for 14 days, the mention of contact tracing if positive, the reasoning regarding overlapping symptoms, and the note that management is supportive regardless of the result. It covers approximately 50-60% of the information contained in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, correctly attributing information to turn D-52. There are no hallucinations or external information added.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is extremely relevant and concise, focusing exclusively on answering the four specific queries posed in the prompt without unnecessary filler."
