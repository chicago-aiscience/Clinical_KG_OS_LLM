  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects D-37: the clinician will review the information with the doctor working today, then return shortly to discuss next steps, including whether tests are needed and how to proceed. No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core required elements: (1) who else is involved (the doctor working today) and (2) the follow-up actions mentioned (return shortly; discuss potential tests and how to move forward). It omits some secondary details present in the Gold Answer (e.g., inference about trainee role, explicit note that no specific tests/treatments were named, patient acknowledgment, courteous farewell).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by D-37 and do not introduce extra, unverifiable details. No hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question about next steps, decision-making involvement, and follow-up actions; no irrelevant content."
