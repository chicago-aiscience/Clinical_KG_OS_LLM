  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the information provided in both the gold answer and the source transcript. All clinical recommendations (COVID-19 swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing triggers, and supportive care) are correctly attributed to the physician's statements in D-52.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses two details found in the gold answer: the expected timeframe for test results (24-48 hours) and the doctor's mention of a potential alternative diagnosis (other viral illnesses) if the COVID test is negative. It successfully covers all specific categories requested in the prompt (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims regarding the management plan are directly supported by section D-52 of the dialogue. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is perfectly relevant, focusing exclusively on the doctor's management plan as requested by the prompt without any extraneous information."
