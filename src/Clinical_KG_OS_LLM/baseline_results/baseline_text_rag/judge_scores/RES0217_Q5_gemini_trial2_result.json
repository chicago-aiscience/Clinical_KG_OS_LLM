  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the facts presented in both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the link between the patient's weekend activities and the 72-hour attachment estimate, as well as the use of the Lyme distribution map for the Strathroy area to justify treatment.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary points: the timeline leading to the >72 hour estimate and the geographic risk assessment. However, it is less detailed than the gold answer, omitting specific details like the tick being removed 'earlier today', the specific location 'along the creek', and the patient's uncertainty about the exact time of attachment.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript. There is a minor citation error where [D-5] is cited for the 72-hour duration estimate, but that specific calculation is actually found in [D-6].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the two specific parts of the question without introducing unnecessary information."
