  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the doctor's inquiry (D-28) and the response about grandparents' asthma (P-28), as well as the differentiation via prior workup and absence of shortness of breath/wheezing during activity (P-28), all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. Minor discrepancy: attributes response and differentiation to 'patient' rather than mother (as clarified in Gold), but core facts match without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: doctor's inquiry with context (D-28), relevance to cough, mother's disclosure of grandparents' asthma (P-28), doctor's summary (D-30), differentiation via workup/no SOB/wheezing/activity (P-28), current dry cough details, runny nose, absence of wheeze/SOB, prior shorter respiratory issues/no dry cough (P-24). Generated covers inquiry, family asthma, and core differentiation evidence (~40-50% coverage, main connection and primary differentiator included but misses symptom details, relevance, prior history, doctor's summary).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: inquiry (D-28), grandparents asthma/workup/no SOB/wheezing/activity (P-28). Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by explaining connection (inquiry revealed family asthma) and differentiation evidence (absence of SOB/wheezing from symptom profile), no off-topic content."
