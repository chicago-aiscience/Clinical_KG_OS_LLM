  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate. It correctly identifies 'decongestants' as the medication tried, 'worked a little bit' as the assessment, and 'Tylenol cold' as the recommendation. These align perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all components of the question but lacks the level of detail found in the Gold Answer. It misses the patient's specific reasoning for why they thought it worked (the transition from stuffy to runny) and the doctor's additional recommendation for hydration and supportive care.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript. It cites the correct speaker turns (P-10, D-39) and does not hallucinate any information.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the three parts of the prompt without including unnecessary information."
