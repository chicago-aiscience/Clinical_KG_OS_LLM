  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer states that 'the patient reports that the loss of smell,' which is factually accurate and directly matches the Gold Answer and transcript [P-1]. There are no factual errors, contradictions, or discrepancies in the limited content provided.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) all three symptoms began simultaneously ~2 days prior [P-1,P-2]; (2) dry cough confirmed to start at same time [D-6,P-6]; (3) sensory symptoms consistent, no fluctuation [D-5,P-5]; (4) dry cough consistent, no worsening [D-8,P-8]; (5) symptoms not intermittent/variable; (6) partial sensory loss persisted [P-4]; (7) no prior similar symptoms [D-3,P-3]. Generated answer covers 0% of these (only vaguely starts on loss of smell).",
    "faithfulness": "The single claim ('patient reports that the loss of smell') is directly verifiable in transcript [P-1], with accurate grounding. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer begins directly addressing the question by referencing the patient's report of loss of smell (a core symptom), with no off-topic or irrelevant content; perfectly focused despite truncation."
