  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the child sometimes uses OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications involved. However, it slightly overstates medication use by implying she “takes Reactine” (without clarifying it is occasional), and it provides incorrect citations (it references D-36/D-47 where the relevant statements are from P-36/P-47).",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) occasional Reactine/OTC antihistamines for seasonal allergies; (2) no prescribed medications. Key points missed: (1) for the current wheezing/SOB episodes the mother gives her nothing and episodes resolve with rest; (2) confirmation of no regular medications beyond occasional Reactine; (3) prior infections did not require antibiotics. Overall, it captures the allergy medication and lack of prescriptions but omits the respiratory-episode management details central to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The content stated is supported by the transcript (seasonal allergies treated with occasional OTC Reactine; no prescribed meds). No clear hallucinations. The main faithfulness issue is inaccurate citation formatting (doctor vs parent line references).",
    "relevance": "It addresses the medication history and whether prescribed medications are part of management, but it does not address treatments used for the current respiratory episodes (explicitly asked), making it only partially responsive."
