  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states the medication regimen as multivitamins only (citing P-40), which matches the Gold Answer's core fact. It identifies the allergy as penicillin (P-37) and the reaction as a rash (P-38), both fully consistent with the Gold Answer. No factual errors or contradictions; all stated facts align perfectly.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) multivitamins only (P-40) - covered; (2) pre-diabetic with glucose monitoring but no Rx meds (P-33) - missed; (3) no high blood pressure (P-34) - missed; (4) no cholesterol issues (P-35) - missed; (5) penicillin allergy (P-37) - covered; (6) rash reaction (P-38) - covered; (7) no trouble breathing (P-39) - missed; (8) clinical relevance note - missed (interpretive). Covers the three direct question elements (regimen, allergy, reaction) fully (~80% of factual content), misses supportive context.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer directly verifiable: multivitamins at P-40 ('I just take multivitamins, that's it though'), penicillin allergy at P-37, rash at P-38. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses all parts of the question (medication regimen, drug allergy, specific adverse reaction) with no off-topic content or tangents."
