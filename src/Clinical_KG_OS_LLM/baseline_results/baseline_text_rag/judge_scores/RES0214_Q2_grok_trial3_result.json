  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states the medication regimen as multivitamins (P-40), allergy to penicillin (P-37), and rash as the reaction (P-38), which are all facts directly matching the Gold Answer and transcript with no errors or contradictions. Minor details like pre-diabetes or no breathing issues are absent but not contradicted. Fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) meds = multivitamins only (P-40) - covered; 2) pre-diabetic monitoring glucose (P-33), no Rx meds - missed; 3) no HTN (P-34) - missed; 4) no cholesterol (P-35) - missed; 5) penicillin allergy (P-37) - covered; 6) rash reaction (P-38) - covered; 7) no trouble breathing (P-39) - missed; 8) clinical relevance - missed. Covers core question elements (regimen, allergy, reaction ~60-70%) but misses supporting context.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: multivitamins in P-40 ('I just take multivitamins, that's it'), penicillin in P-37, rash in P-38. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers the three-part question (regimen, allergy, specific reaction) with no off-topic content or tangents."
