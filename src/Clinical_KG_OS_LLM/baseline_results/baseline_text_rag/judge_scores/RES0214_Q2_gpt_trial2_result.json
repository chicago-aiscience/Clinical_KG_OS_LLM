  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the patient takes only multivitamins (P-40), reports a penicillin allergy (P-37), and experiences a rash as the reaction (P-38). These match the Gold Answer with no contradictions or factual errors.",
    "completeness": "It includes the core requested elements from the Gold Answer: current medication regimen (multivitamins only), the drug allergy (penicillin), and the specific adverse reaction (rash). It does not mention the additional Gold Answer detail that she denies trouble breathing (P-39) and the explicit clarification that she is not on any prescription medications, though the latter is implied by “multivitamins only.”",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript citations provided (P-40, P-37, P-38). No added or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question (medication regimen, allergy, and reaction) without tangential information."
