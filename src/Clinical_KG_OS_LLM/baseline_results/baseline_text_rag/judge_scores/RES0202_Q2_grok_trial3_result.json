  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts from the Gold Answer and transcript without errors or contradictions. Key elements like COVID swab (24-48 hours), 14-day isolation specifically including separation from the younger sister, and ER red flags (high temp, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting) match precisely, with correct citations to [D-44]. Phrasing such as 'symptoms compatible with COVID' is consistent with the transcript's 'symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid' (likely 'aligned'). No factual discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab test and timeline [D-44], 14-day isolation specifically from younger sister [D-44], ER precautions [D-44]. Partially covers household (mentions sister but not full parents + sister [P-35]). Missed: false-negative possibility and other viral illness [D-44], no medications/supportive care/wait for results [D-44], mother's acknowledgment of viral care [P-41], school test requirement [P-41]. Covers core management measures (80-99% of doctor's direct recommendations).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript [D-44]: COVID swab, 24-48 hours results, 14-day isolation including from younger sister ('that includes from his his younger sister possible'), ER instructions for worsening symptoms. Citations accurate. No hallucinated details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses the question's focus on doctor's management measures (diagnostic tests, isolation instructions/duration, specific household member to isolate from: younger sister), structured as bullet points for clarity, with relevant addition of ER flags as part of management. No off-topic content."
