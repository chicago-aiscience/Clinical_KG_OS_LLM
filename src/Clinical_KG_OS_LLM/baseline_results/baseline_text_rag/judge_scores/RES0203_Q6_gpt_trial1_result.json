  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is essentially truncated (“Based on the transcript excerpts, the doctor assessed…”) and provides no substantive assessment or management plan details to compare with the Gold Answer. Because it does not state the key assessment (symptoms consistent with COVID) or any elements of the plan, it fails to be factually correct relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Misses all required key points from the Gold Answer: COVID-consistent assessment; COVID swab test (and collection method); isolation instructions; results timeline (1–2 days); mention of possible additional tests; follow-up/return with more questions; plan to review with supervising physician; reassurance/next steps. Coverage is effectively 0%.",
    "faithfulness": "No concrete clinical claims are made, so there are no hallucinated details. The only content (“Based on the transcript…”) is consistent with using the transcript, but it does not provide verifiable statements beyond that.",
    "relevance": "Does not answer the question (no assessment/plan, tests, instructions, timelines, follow-up, or supervision consult details)."
