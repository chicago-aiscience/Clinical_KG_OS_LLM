  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer provides a correct detail for Wednesday (the child seemed fine and developed a dry cough), which aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is severely incomplete. It only addresses Wednesday evening and cuts off entirely, missing the developments for Thursday and Friday, the severity changes in the cough, and the emergence of fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, and other symptoms detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The single claim provided is grounded in the transcript and contains no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "While the initial point is relevant, the response fails to address the bulk of the question's requirements (detailing the evolution through Friday) because it is a truncated fragment."
