  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab test as the diagnostic method, the 24-48 hour turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness. All facts align with the Gold Answer and the source transcript. The citations [D-52] are accurate.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all the core elements required by the question: (1) condition to rule out (COVID-19), (2) diagnostic test (swab), (3) turnaround time (24-48 hours), and (4) alternative diagnosis (another viral illness). However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the rationale for testing ('because a lot of your symptoms overlap'), the 14-day isolation instruction, contact tracing mention, and the supportive management approach. These omissions represent approximately 20-30% of the Gold Answer's content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at D-52. The answer uses proper citations and does not include any hallucinated information. It accurately quotes or paraphrases the doctor's statements without adding fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly focused on answering the specific question asked. It addresses all three components: the condition to rule out, the diagnostic test with turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis. There is no irrelevant content or tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a highly accurate and relevant response that correctly identifies all key facts from the Gold Answer. It achieves perfect scores in correctness, faithfulness, and relevance by accurately stating the condition (COVID-19), test (swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours), and alternative diagnosis (viral illness) with proper citations. The completeness score is 4 rather than 5 because it omits contextual details such as the symptom overlap rationale, isolation instructions, contact tracing, and supportive management approach, though these are secondary to the core question asked."
