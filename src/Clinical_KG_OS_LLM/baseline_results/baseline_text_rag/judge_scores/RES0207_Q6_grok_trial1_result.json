  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer and transcript: reviewing with the other doctor (D-37), returning shortly, discussing next steps, potential tests, and moving forward. No factual errors or contradictions; minor omissions do not affect accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: doctor will review with other doctor working today (D-37), return shortly to discuss next steps (D-37/D-38), potential tests, and how to move forward (D-37). Missed: explicit mention of collaborative process/trainee implication, patient acknowledgment (P-37), emphasis that no specific tests/treatments were ordered and plan is contingent. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer directly verifiable in transcript (D-37): exact phrasing about reviewing with other doctor, coming back shortly, next steps/tests/move forward. Citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses the question by specifying next steps communicated (review and discuss), who involved (doctor working today), and follow-up actions (tests, move forward). No off-topic content."
