  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the triad driving suspicion—loss of smell, loss of taste, and a (mild) dry cough—which matches the Gold Answer. It also correctly states the doctor linked these symptoms to COVID-19 in D-39 and ordered a swab test. The only issue is citation inaccuracy: the symptom statements come from the patient (e.g., P-1, P-4), not from D-1 or D-5, though the symptom content itself is accurate.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core required elements: (1) symptom combination (anosmia + ageusia + dry cough), (2) the doctor’s explicit linkage to COVID-19 (D-39), and (3) the chosen test method (swab).\nMisses several key contextual points included in the Gold Answer that strengthen the doctor’s reasoning: the patient initially raised COVID concern (P-1), the doctor’s systematic confirmation of absent associated symptoms (no fever, no dyspnea, etc.), the “otherwise pretty well” summary (D-16), and the self-isolation guidance while awaiting results (D-39).",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims (symptoms, doctor’s rationale statement, ordering a swab) are supported by the transcript. However, the provided citations for the symptoms are not faithful/accurate (they cite D-1 and D-5, which are clinician questions rather than the patient’s symptom report). No major hallucinated clinical facts are introduced.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by naming the symptom combination, stating how the doctor connected that pattern to suspected COVID-19, and specifying the diagnostic test method (swab). No notable irrelevant content."
