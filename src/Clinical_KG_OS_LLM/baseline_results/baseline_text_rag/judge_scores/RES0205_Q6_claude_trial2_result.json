  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: listening to heart and lungs, performing physical exam, consulting with supervising physician, and returning to discuss next steps. However, it misses some specific details like 'auscultation' terminology and the collaborative nature emphasized in the Gold Answer. The facts stated are accurate but simplified.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main elements (physical exam components: heart/lung auscultation; consultation process with supervising physician; return to discuss next steps) but lacks several details present in the Gold Answer: the reference to D-1 foreshadowing, patient agreement (P-37), the explicit mention that no diagnosis/medication was provided, and the note about this being consistent with a learner/trainee role. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in D-37. The answer accurately cites 'listen to the patient's heart and lungs,' 'quick physical exam,' 'consult with the doctor they are working with,' and 'return to discuss next steps.' No hallucinated content detected. Citations are implicit but accurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: (1) physical examination components specified (heart and lungs listening, quick physical exam), (2) the process for determining next steps (consulting with supervising doctor), and (3) the stated plan (returning to discuss). Fully focused on the question with no irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and relevant summary of the doctor's end-of-consultation plan, correctly identifying the physical examination components (heart and lung auscultation, quick physical exam) and the consultation process. It demonstrates perfect faithfulness to the source transcript with no hallucinations. However, it lacks the comprehensive detail of the Gold Answer, omitting contextual elements like the foreshadowing in D-1, patient agreement, and the significance of withholding diagnosis/treatment pending supervision. The answer is correct and relevant but somewhat condensed compared to the more thorough Gold Answer."
