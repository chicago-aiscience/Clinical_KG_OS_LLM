  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately recaps the doctor's key findings from D-58, including 3-4 day dry cough, fever, headache, no sputum, no asthma, and no recent sick contacts except brother (points 1-4 in Gold); minor discrepancy as it omits the specific mention of no medications aside from Claritin (point 5); Jessica's primary goal matches exactly from P-60. Core facts fully consistent with minimal omission.",
    "completeness": "Covers key doctor recap points 1-4 fully (dry cough/fever/headache, no sputum, sick contacts, no asthma), misses point 5 (Claritin); covers Jessica's primary goal from P-60; omits doctor's framing of visit purpose and P-61 detail on malaise/fatigue. Covers ~80-90% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in D-58 (summary) and P-60 (goal); accurate citations; no unverifiable or hallucinated details present.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses the question on doctor's recapped findings and Jessica's primary goal/next steps; no off-topic content."
