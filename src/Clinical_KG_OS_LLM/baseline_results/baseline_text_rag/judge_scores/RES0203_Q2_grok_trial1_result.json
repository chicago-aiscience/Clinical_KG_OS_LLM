  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly states patient tried no treatments [P-9], aligning with Gold. Doctor's recommendation of COVID swab test and self-isolation instructions match transcript and Gold facts, though Gold notes no medication prescribed (implied in Generated). Minor issue: citations [D-40] incorrect (should be [D-39]); core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers: patient tried nothing [P-9]. Covers: COVID swab test, self-isolation instructions. Misses: no regular medications [D-24,P-24], results take 'day or two', explicit 'no medication prescribed', potential other tests/consult with supervising doctor [D-40]. Approximately 60% coverage of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: no treatments [P-9], swab test [D-39], self-isolate [D-39]. Citations inaccurate ([D-40] instead of [D-39]), but content grounded in transcript, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question: patient's prior treatments (none), doctor's recommended test (swab) and instructions (self-isolate), no irrelevant content."
