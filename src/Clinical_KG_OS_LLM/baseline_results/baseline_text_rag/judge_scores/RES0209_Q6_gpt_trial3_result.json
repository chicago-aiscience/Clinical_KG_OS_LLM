  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the core elements in the Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 swab is mentioned explicitly in D-29; (2) the clinician suggests a “little change” to medications to improve asthma control in D-43; (3) the clinician states they will go talk to the doctor and then return shortly (D-43/D-44). The only slight issue is wording: it says “supervising physician,” which is an inference (though strongly supported by the clinician’s repeated plan to present to “the doctor” before returning). No factual contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "It captures the three requested components (test, medication change suggestion, consult/return). However, compared with the Gold Answer it omits several supporting/nuancing points: that infectious screening questions were negative yet swab is still planned; that the patient currently only uses a rescue bronchodilator with increased frequency; the explicit rationale that the interviewer is likely a trainee presenting to a supervisor; the clinician’s goal that the patient should play sports without needing medication every time. Given the question asks for the overall plan including the three specified elements, the answer is mostly complete but not fully as detailed as the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are grounded in the transcript: COVID swab (D-29), medication change suggestion (D-43), plan to talk to the doctor and return shortly (D-43/D-44). The “supervising physician” phrasing is a mild interpretation but consistent with the transcript and not a clear hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question’s three requested elements and does not add irrelevant content."
