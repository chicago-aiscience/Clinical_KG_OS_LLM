  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the physical exam components, the COVID swab, the consultation with the attending, and the decision criteria involving labs and vitals.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a few points mentioned in the Gold Answer: 1) It omits the doctor's clinical impression (COPD exacerbation/infection) which provides the rationale for the plan. 2) While it mentions 'labs' in the decision criteria, it fails to list 'labs' as a specific diagnostic test to be performed (listing only the COVID swab). 3) It omits the patient's agreement to the plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript (specifically D-43), with no hallucinations. All points can be directly verified.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the four specific areas requested in the prompt (examinations, tests, consultations, and decision criteria)."
