  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Matches the Gold Answer on the key factual items: the patient had tried OTC decongestants and said they helped “a little bit” (P-10), and the doctor recommended an OTC product like Tylenol Cold (D-39). No contradictions or incorrect additions.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core items asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer (decongestants tried; partial effectiveness; Tylenol Cold recommendation). It omits additional counseling in the Gold Answer (hydration/supportive care framing and expectation of symptoms lasting a few weeks).",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript (P-10, D-39). No hallucinated medications or effects.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what was tried, perceived effectiveness, and the OTC recommendation; no tangential content."
