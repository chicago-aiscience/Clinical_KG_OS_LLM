  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition ruled out, correctly cites the mother's report of prior workup and absence of shortness of breath and wheezing even during physical activity, matching Gold Answer's core facts without errors; minor omission of explicit 'grandparents' detail but faithful to transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: asthma (100%), ruled out via workup and specific negatives (shortness of breath, wheezing even with physical activity) cited by mother (100%); missed: explicit grandparents mention, doctor's question/acknowledgment citations (D-28/D-30), mother's conclusion 'he doesn't have that', patient's additional history (P-24) — covers ~85% of Gold's details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in P-28 ('grandparents had um asthma... worked up for that... doesn't get short of breath or wheezing or anything like that with even with physical activity'); accurate citations, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by naming asthma and listing exact symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing) not exhibited even during activity, as cited by mother; concise and on-point with no off-topic content."
