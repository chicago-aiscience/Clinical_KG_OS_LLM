  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two proposed diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) and accurately states the rationale for the COVID swab as being performed for anyone presenting with similar symptoms, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript (D-37, D-39). No contradictory or incorrect statements are present.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core required elements from the Gold Answer: (1) chest X-ray and (2) COVID swab, plus (3) the protocol-based rationale for the swab. It omits additional details included in the Gold Answer (e.g., chest X-ray rationale of “better look,” description of X-ray as an internal picture, discomfort reassurance, plan to arrange tests and return with supervising doctor). These omissions are not strictly necessary to answer the question but are part of the Gold Answer’s key supporting points.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements made are directly supported by the transcript excerpts cited (D-37, D-39). No hallucinated or unverifiable details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what procedures were proposed and the specific rationale for the COVID swab, with no irrelevant content."
