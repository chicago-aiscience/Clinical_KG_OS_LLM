  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer regarding the patient not taking medications and the specific details of their anxiety medication history and acid reflux management.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two key conditions mentioned in the gold answer: hay fever (where no treatment is described) and the cough (where the patient requested medication but none was given yet). The prompt asked for status 'across all of their conditions', so omitting these makes the answer less complete than the gold standard.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript and correctly cites the paragraphs (P-23, P-24, P-25).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the specific sub-questions about acid reflux and prescribed medications."
