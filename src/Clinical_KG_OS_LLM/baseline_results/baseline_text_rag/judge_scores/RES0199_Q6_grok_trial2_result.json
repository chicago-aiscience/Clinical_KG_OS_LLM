  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the management plan from the Gold Answer, including the COVID-19 swab test, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and key supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol/NSAIDs for symptoms). Minor discrepancies include omission of the 24-48 hour results timeframe, the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative, the conditional 'if you get any' for fevers, and explicit note of no prescription medications beyond supportive care. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID-19 swab (partial, misses results time), 14-day isolation (full), contact tracing if positive (full), supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep well, antipyretics/Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches - mostly full). Missed: results in 24-48 hours, alternative viral illness if negative, 'if you get any' fevers qualifier, no other prescriptions. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations. No hallucinations, fabrications, or unverifiable details; phrasing closely matches the doctor's words (e.g., 'isolate for 14 days', 'public health will be in touch... contact tracing', supportive care items verbatim).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured as a bullet-point list directly addressing the question's specified elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), with no off-topic content or tangents."
