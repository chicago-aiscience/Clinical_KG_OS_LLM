  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the doctor’s key symptom-based trigger for suspecting an infectious etiology/COVID-19: fever and sore throat, explicitly referenced by the doctor in D-53. It also correctly identifies the vaccination-history detail that prompted influenza to be raised: the patient had not received a flu shot this year (P-53), leading to the doctor’s statement in D-54. No statements contradict the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) fever + sore throat as key infectious/COVID concern; (2) broader viral symptom cluster (stuffy nose, muscle aches, fever, sore throat); (3) epidemiologic context of husband with similar symptoms strengthening COVID concern; (4) lack of flu shot leading to influenza differential. Generated Answer includes (1) and (4) fully, but omits (2) and (3). Thus it captures the core asked elements but not all supporting details highlighted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript: fever and sore throat (P-1; D-53) and lack of flu shot (D-53/P-53; D-54). No hallucinated symptoms or vaccination details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question (symptoms prompting infectious/COVID consideration and vaccination detail prompting influenza differential) without tangents."
