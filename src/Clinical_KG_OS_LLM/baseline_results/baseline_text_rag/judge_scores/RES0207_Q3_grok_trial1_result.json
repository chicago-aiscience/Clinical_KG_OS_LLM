  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states the patient missed Keppra due to a changed dinner schedule on daughter's birthday (matches P-24 and Gold), and quotes P-9 accurately with a reasonable paraphrase of the trailing 'yeah' as '[caused it]' (consistent with Gold's interpretation). All facts align with Gold and transcript; no errors or contradictions. Score: 5.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) missed dose connected to seizure same night due to routine disruption [P-8, P-24]; (2) patient recognition in P-9 spontaneous statement attributing causality; (3) voluntary in response to D-9, not prompted; (4) seizures usually rare [P-9]; (5) one-time lapse birthday [P-24]; (6) no clinician confirmation, patient's own. Covered: (1) partial (miss and reason, timing implied not explicit), (2) yes P-9 quote, (5) yes birthday dinner. Missed: explicit timing P-8, spontaneity/context D-9/P-9, rarity, no clinician note. Covers ~80% core (connection and main evidence), misses elaborative details. Score: 4.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: Keppra [P-23], miss reason birthday dinner [P-24], P-9 quote directly from transcript (minor interpretive completion but accurate), citation to P-9 correct. No hallucinations or unverifiable details. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses 'how missed dose connects' (via reason for miss implying causality) and 'evidence patient recognized link' (P-9 quote). Concise, no tangents or off-topic content. Score: 5."
