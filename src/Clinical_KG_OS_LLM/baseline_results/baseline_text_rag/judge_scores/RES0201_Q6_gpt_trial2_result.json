  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All specific elements provided (COVID swab, chest X-ray, isolate until results, and continued isolation if symptoms persist despite a negative result) are consistent with the Gold Answer and supported by D-43. No contradictory or incorrect statements are present.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key requested components: (1) diagnostic tests (COVID swab, chest X-ray), (2) isolation until results return, and (3) continued isolation if still symptomatic even with a negative result. It omits the explicit overall assessment framing that symptoms are consistent with COVID-19 and does not mention the plan to consult/return to discuss next steps, both included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript (D-43). No additional unsupported details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question’s requested items (tests, isolation instructions, and the condition for ongoing isolation). No irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The generated answer is accurate, well-grounded, and focused, but slightly incomplete because it omits the doctor’s explicit assessment that symptoms align with COVID-19 and the note about returning after consulting the supervising physician."
