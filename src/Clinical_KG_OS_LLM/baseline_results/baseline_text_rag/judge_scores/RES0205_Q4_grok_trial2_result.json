  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition, the COVID test as the method, and the timing as two weeks ago at symptom onset, matching the Gold Answer exactly on these points. It also correctly notes the workplace concerns of colleagues being scared and the desire to return without coughing, with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 ruled out, (2) via 'covid test' negative [P-35], (3) at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior [P-36], (4) hospital clerk job [P-34], (5) PPE use [P-17], (6) coworkers scared [P-35], (7) staying home [P-36], (8) eager to return without cough [P-36], (9) meds desire tied to return [P-35]. Generated covers 1-3 fully, 6 and 8; misses 4,5,7,9 (job context, PPE, staying home, meds), covering ~55% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: COVID-19 and test (P-35), timing (P-36), scared colleagues and return without coughing (P-35, P-36). Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses all four elements of the question (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns) with focused content and no off-topic material."
