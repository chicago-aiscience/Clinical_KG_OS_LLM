  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the plan including COVID swab and chest imaging (paraphrased from X-ray description), consultation with supervising physician, and follow-up discussion, but has minor discrepancies like vagueness on 'chest X-ray' specifically (calls it 'imaging') and implies discussing 'findings' post-tests when transcript is pre-test planning; aligns closely with Gold Answer's facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: COVID swab, chest imaging (X-ray), consultation with supervising doctor, return to discuss next steps. Missed from Gold: explicit mention of initial physical exam (lungs/heart auscultation), specific 'chest X-ray', age-appropriate explanations, patient/mother acknowledgment, and concluding thanks; covers ~70% of details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly grounded in transcript: swab and X-ray explanation in D-37/D-39 (picture of body inside), arrangement in D-40, consultation/follow-up in D-1/D-37/D-40; citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's requirements (diagnostic tests, consultation, follow-up steps communicated), using bullet points matching the elements specified, no off-topic content."
