  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the COVID swab as the test ordered, and the sick friend contact as the prompting detail. All three core facts align with the Gold Answer and are accurately sourced from the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main elements requested in the question but lacks the depth and context provided in the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) the full quote from D-43, (2) additional details about the outdoor meetings and false sense of safety, (3) the doctor's follow-up questions about COVID symptoms (smell, taste, confusion, muscle aches), (4) the travel question, and (5) the clinical reasoning that justified testing despite absent symptoms. It covers approximately 60% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer correctly references D-43 for the COVID diagnosis and test, and P-20 for the social contact detail. No hallucinated information is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: the condition to rule out, the test ordered, and the social contact detail. It stays focused without irrelevant content, though it is more concise than comprehensive."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all three key elements requested (COVID-19, COVID swab, sick friend contact) with accurate citations. However, it provides minimal detail compared to the Gold Answer, missing important contextual information such as the patient's acknowledgment of walking too close despite being outside, the doctor's systematic screening for COVID symptoms, and the clinical reasoning. While factually correct and relevant, the answer's brevity limits its completeness."
