All facts match Gold Answer and transcript with no contradictions or errors, though citation for statin is D-15 (acknowledgment) vs P-15 (patient statement). Fully consistent.",

Also covers tick lab and blood work (in Gold plan). Covers ~50% of key points (core statin and prophylactic), misses past history, allergies, details, environmental.",
