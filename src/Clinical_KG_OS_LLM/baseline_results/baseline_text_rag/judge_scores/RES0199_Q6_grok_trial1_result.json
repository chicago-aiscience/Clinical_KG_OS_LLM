  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: COVID-19 swab test, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and detailed supportive care (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol/NSAIDs). Minor discrepancies include omission of the 24-48 hour results timeline, alternative viral illness diagnosis, 'if you get any' for fevers, and explicit no-prescription statement, but no contradictions or errors in stated facts.",
    "completeness": "Covers: diagnostic test (swab for COVID, misses results time), 14-day isolation fully, contact tracing condition fully, all supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, antipyretics/Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Missed: results timeline, alternative diagnosis if negative, no-prescription note. Approximately 85-90% coverage of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] of transcript: swab for COVID, isolate 14 days, public health contact tracing if positive, supportive care details match verbatim (hydrated, nutritious food, sleeping well, antipyretics like Tylenol for fevers if any, Tylenol or NSAIDs for aches). Citations accurate, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured with bullets directly addressing the question's elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, tracing conditions, supportive care), no irrelevant content or tangents."
