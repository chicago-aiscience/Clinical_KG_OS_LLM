  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence. What is present is factually accurate - it correctly identifies asthma as the suspected diagnosis and mentions cardiac ischemia being lower on the differential, which aligns with the Gold Answer and transcript (D-35, D-36). However, the incompleteness means it fails to address major components of the question.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete, covering less than 20% of required content. It begins addressing the assessment but cuts off abruptly. It completely fails to mention: (1) the physical examination plan (lung auscultation), (2) the initial treatment intervention (rescue puffers), (3) the contingency approach if initial treatment fails, and (4) consultation with supervising physician. The Gold Answer covers all these elements comprehensively.",
    "faithfulness": "What content exists is grounded in the transcript. The mention of asthma as top differential and cardiac causes being lower matches D-35 and D-36. However, the incomplete nature prevents full evaluation of faithfulness. No hallucinations are present in the fragment provided, but the truncation suggests potential technical issues rather than intentional content.",
    "relevance": "The fragment that exists is relevant to the question, beginning to address the assessment component. However, the severe incompleteness means it fails to address three of the four major components requested: physical examination plans, treatment intervention, and contingency approach. Only a partial assessment is provided before the cutoff."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence after only beginning to address the doctor's assessment. While the fragment present is factually accurate and grounded in the transcript (correctly identifying asthma as the suspected diagnosis and cardiac causes as less likely), it fails to cover the vast majority of required content. It completely omits discussion of the physical examination plan (lung auscultation), the initial treatment intervention (rescue puffers), the contingency approach if treatment fails, and consultation with the supervising physician. The response covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer, making it inadequate despite the accuracy of its limited content."
