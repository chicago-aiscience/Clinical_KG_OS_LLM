  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence with only 'Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient's symptoms began' and provides no actual information. There is no factual content to evaluate against the Gold Answer, which comprehensively describes the chronological progression (stuffy nose → sore throat → fever with muscle aches, plus husband's timeline starting ~4 days earlier).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) stuffy nose as first symptom, (2) sore throat development, (3) fever for 3 days, (4) muscle aches concurrent with fever, (5) husband's symptoms for past week, (6) ~4 day difference in onset between husband and patient, (7) pattern consistent with household transmission. The response is essentially non-existent.",
    "faithfulness": "Cannot assess faithfulness as there is no substantive content provided. The fragment 'Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient's symptoms began' is technically grounded (symptoms are discussed in the transcript) but provides no actual claims to evaluate for hallucination or accuracy.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. The question specifically asks for chronological progression, which symptom appeared first, what followed, and comparison to husband's timeline. The incomplete sentence provides none of this information, making it completely irrelevant despite appearing to start appropriately."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is essentially non-existent, consisting only of an incomplete introductory phrase that cuts off before providing any substantive information. It fails to describe any aspect of the symptom progression (stuffy nose → sore throat → fever with muscle aches), does not mention the husband's timeline (symptoms for past week vs. patient's 3 days of fever), and provides no chronological detail whatsoever. This represents a complete failure to answer the question."
