  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the age of diagnosis (8) and the baseline frequency of bronchodilator use (once every two weeks). It mentions a duration of 'past week' for the cough; while the Gold Answer notes a clarification to 'two weeks' later in the transcript, the patient did initially state one week. However, the answer is cut off mid-sentence.",
    "completeness": "The answer is highly incomplete. It misses the specific current frequency of bronchodilator use (5-6 times per week), the mention of chest tightness, nighttime symptoms, and details regarding wheezing. It ends abruptly mid-word ('whe').",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is directly supported by the transcript (P-1, P-2, P-8). There are no hallucinations, just an incomplete response.",
    "relevance": "The response begins to address the question directly but fails to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of symptoms as requested, primarily due to being truncated."
