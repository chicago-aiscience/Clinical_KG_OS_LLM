  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (fever and sore throat) and the vaccination status (no flu shot) as documented in the transcript and gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the primary symptoms and the vaccination status. However, it misses two key elements included in the Gold Answer: 1) the epidemiological context regarding the patient's husband having similar symptoms, which was a specific driver for the COVID-19 suspicion, and 2) the broader symptom cluster (muscle aches, stuffy nose) mentioned by the doctor.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the source transcript and citations (D-1, D-53, D-54).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the user's question without any unnecessary tangents."
