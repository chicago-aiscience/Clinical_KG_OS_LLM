  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient missed Keppra due to a disrupted routine on their daughter’s birthday (P-24) and links this missed dose to the seizure, which aligns with the Gold Answer’s causal connection. It correctly cites the patient’s own attribution in P-9 (\"I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have...\"). No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) missed Keppra dose due to altered dinner schedule/daughter’s birthday (P-24), (2) patient’s expressed belief that the missed dose contributed to the seizure (P-9). Misses/understates: (a) explicit temporal linkage that the seizure occurred the same night as the missed dose (Gold ties P-8 with P-24), (b) that the patient volunteered this attribution in response to a question about post-seizure issues rather than being directly asked about adherence (D-9 context), (c) patient noting seizures are infrequent (P-9) supporting that this was an unusual, trigger-related event, and (d) that no clinician confirmation of causality is given in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript: Keppra use and missed dose explanation (P-23, P-24) and the patient’s causal attribution (P-9). No additional ungrounded clinical interpretation is introduced beyond what the patient said.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by explaining how the missed anti-epileptic dose relates to the seizure and cites the patient’s statement indicating they recognized the link. No tangential content."
