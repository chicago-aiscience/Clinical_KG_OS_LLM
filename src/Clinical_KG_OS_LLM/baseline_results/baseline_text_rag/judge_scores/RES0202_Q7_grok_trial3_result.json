  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that on Wednesday the child seemed fine at school but developed a dry cough, which is fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [P-1] citing the child seeming 'fine' after school and developing a 'little dry cough' that night. No factual errors or contradictions in the provided content.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: Wednesday evening cough onset (no other symptoms), Thursday cough worse + tired, Friday cough worsening + first fever + decreased appetite/loss of taste + fatigue + runny nose, stepwise worsening summary, 3-day correction. Generated covers only Wednesday cough onset partially (~10% coverage), misses all other days, severity changes, fever, and symptoms entirely.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer ('seemed fine at school but developed a dry cough' on Wednesday) are directly verifiable in transcript [P-1]; no hallucinations, unverifiable details, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer begins directly addressing the question's day-by-day evolution starting with Wednesday cough onset but abruptly stops, covering only the first day without addressing Thursday/Friday, severity progression, fever, or other symptoms; no irrelevant content but incomplete scope makes it partially relevant."
