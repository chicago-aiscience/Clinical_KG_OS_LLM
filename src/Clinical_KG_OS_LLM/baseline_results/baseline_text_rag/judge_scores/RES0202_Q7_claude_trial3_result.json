  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains only one partially correct statement about Wednesday's symptoms. It fails to mention critical details: (1) The cough started Wednesday *evening/night* after returning home, not during the day; (2) It omits the entire Thursday progression with worsening cough and fatigue; (3) It completely misses Friday's emergence of fever (the most significant development), decreased appetite, possible taste loss, continued fatigue, and runny nose. The single statement provided is factually incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 10-15% of the Gold Answer's key points. It only mentions Wednesday's dry cough onset but completely omits: Thursday's symptom progression (worsening cough, fatigue), Friday's fever emergence (the primary concern), Friday's additional symptoms (decreased appetite, taste loss, fatigue, runny nose), the three-day timeline clarification, the stepwise worsening pattern, and specific temperature readings. The answer appears incomplete or truncated.",
    "faithfulness": "The partial statement provided is grounded in the transcript [P-1: 'when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but...that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough']. However, the answer is so incomplete that it's impossible to assess whether additional content would have been faithful or hallucinated. What is present is accurate but represents only a fragment of the available information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses part of the question by starting to detail when the cough first appeared on Wednesday. However, it completely fails to address the question's explicit requirements: how the cough changed in severity over three days, when the fever emerged (critical omission), and when other symptoms like fatigue and decreased appetite appeared. The answer is relevant to the question's topic but grossly incomplete in addressing its specific requirements."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete, providing only one partial statement about Wednesday's dry cough onset while omitting the vast majority of requested information. It completely fails to document Thursday's progression (worsening cough, fatigue) and Friday's critical developments (fever emergence at 100-101°F, decreased appetite, possible taste loss, continued fatigue, runny nose). The question specifically asked for day-by-day evolution through three days with details on cough severity changes, fever timing, and emergence of new symptoms—none of which are adequately addressed. While the single statement provided is factually accurate and grounded in the transcript, the answer appears truncated and covers less than 15% of the Gold Answer's key points, making it insufficient for clinical documentation or understanding the illness trajectory."
