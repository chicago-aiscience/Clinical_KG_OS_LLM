  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to be ruled out and correctly states that a COVID swab was ordered, matching D-43. It also accurately cites the patient’s report of contact with a sick friend during outdoor dog walks and sometimes being too close (P-20). No contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core elements in the Gold Answer that directly answer the question: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) COVID swab, and (3) sick social contact during dog walks with occasional close proximity. It omits some supporting details present in the Gold Answer (e.g., that it was a couple of friends, the ‘felt too safe because outside’ nuance, uncertainty about whether the friend was COVID-tested, and broader COVID screening/travel questions).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (D-43, P-20). No evidence of hallucinated or non-verifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the asked items (condition, test, and the social-contact detail prompting consideration) with no irrelevant content."
