  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states 'Information not found in provided excerpts,' which directly contradicts the Gold Answer's factual details from the transcript (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer for pain relief with no effect [P-6]; multivitamin routine [P-25]). This is entirely inaccurate as the information is explicitly present.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: OTC for pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer, ineffective), regular multivitamin, no Rx meds, mentions stress management/smoking. Generated Answer covers 0% of these points.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim of no information in excerpts is false; transcript clearly contains the details at [P-6] and [P-25], making the Generated Answer ungrounded and hallucinatory about the content's absence.",
    "relevance": "The answer does not address the question about specific OTC meds/supplements and effectiveness; it dismisses the query without providing any relevant information."
