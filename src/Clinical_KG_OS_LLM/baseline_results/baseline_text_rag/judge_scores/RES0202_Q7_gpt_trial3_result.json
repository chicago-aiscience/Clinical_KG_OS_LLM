  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer states that on Wednesday the child “seemed fine” and then developed a dry cough. This matches the transcript/gold answer in essence (he was fine when he got home from school Wednesday and developed a little dry cough that night). Minor wording inaccuracy: it says “seemed fine at school,” whereas the transcript specifies he seemed fine when he got home from school.",
    "completeness": "The gold answer describes a 3-day progression (Wed night onset of dry cough; Thu cough persisted/worsened with fatigue; Fri cough worsened further with new fever >100F and additional symptoms: decreased appetite/possible loss of taste, runny nose, fatigue; also correction from 5 days to 3 days). The generated answer only covers the Wednesday onset of dry cough and omits Thursday and Friday evolution, fever timing/temperature, and other symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The only clinical claim made (fine then dry cough on Wednesday) is supported by the transcript ([P-1]). No clear hallucinated content, aside from the slight ambiguity of “at school” vs “after getting home from school.”",
    "relevance": "What is provided is directly about day-by-day evolution and cough onset, but it fails to address most of the question (changes over three days, fever onset, fatigue/appetite changes)."
