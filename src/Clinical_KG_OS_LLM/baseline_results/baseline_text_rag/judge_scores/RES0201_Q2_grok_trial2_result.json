  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the patient's mild COPD and current use of a long-acting beta agonist (directly from P-27 and P-28), and correctly identifies self-treatment attempts of gargling with salt water and painkillers for the sore throat (P-6). No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer; omissions do not introduce inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: chronic management - mild COPD (P-27), long-acting beta agonist (P-28), vitamins (P-30), confirmed as only medications (D-29/D-30), no allergies (P-31); self-treatment - salt water gargle and painkillers with no relief (P-6), no other therapies. Generated covers COPD, LABA, and self-treatments (gargle + painkillers), but misses vitamins, confirmation of only meds, no allergies, no relief detail, and no other therapies mention. Covers approximately 50-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: mild COPD (P-27), long-acting beta agonist (P-28), self-treatments of salt water gargling and painkillers (P-6). Citations are accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by listing the ongoing prescription for COPD (long-acting beta agonist) and self-treatment measures for sore throat (gargling salt water and painkillers), with no off-topic content."
