  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer clearly separates symptoms into two categories from D-36: general infectious process (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches) and additional distinct symptoms for COVID concern (difficulty breathing plus sore throat and cough). The Generated Answer incorrectly includes 'difficulty breathing' in the general infectious process category alongside fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches, and omits it from the additional symptoms, listing only sore throat and cough. This misgrouping introduces significant factual discrepancies and contradictions with the Gold Answer's interpretation.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) general infectious: fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (covered but with extra 'difficulty breathing'); (2) additional for COVID: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough (partially covered, misses difficulty breathing); (3) taste/smell not explicitly cited in assessment (not covered); (4) focus on respiratory findings leading to COVID swab (not covered). Covers approximately 60-70% of key points due to misplacement and omissions.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms cited (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) are directly verifiable in D-36 of the transcript, with accurate citation to D-36. No hallucinated facts; the grouping is an interpretive error but claims are grounded in the transcript text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying specific symptoms from the doctor's assessment in D-36 for each category requested, with no off-topic content."
