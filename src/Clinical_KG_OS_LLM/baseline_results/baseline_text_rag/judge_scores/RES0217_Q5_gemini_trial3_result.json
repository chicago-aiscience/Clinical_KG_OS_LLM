  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the facts presented in the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the activities (hiking on Friday, gardening on Saturday), the duration estimate (>72 hours), and the use of the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map to justify prophylaxis in Strathroy.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main points but misses a subtle detail present in the gold answer: that the tick was removed 'earlier today'. This detail is the missing link in the 'how' part of the math (calculating the time elapsed from Friday/Saturday to the day of the appointment). However, it covers the core logic of the doctor's assessment.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The citations [D-6] for the 72-hour estimate and [D-12, D-13] for the geographic risk are accurate. [D-5] is also cited, which discusses deer ticks specifically, which is relevant context even if not the primary source for the 72-hour claim.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the multi-part question without any irrelevant information."
