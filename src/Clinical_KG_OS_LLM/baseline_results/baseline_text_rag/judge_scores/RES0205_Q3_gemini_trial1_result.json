  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis (COVID-19), the evidence prompting it (hospital work and persistent cough/colleague concern), and the negative test result, all of which align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the core components but omits specific details mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the initial flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose) and the specific timing of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset).",
    "faithfulness": "The claims are grounded in the transcript. However, the citations use 'D-35' (the doctor's turn) for information actually provided by the patient in 'P-34' and 'P-35'. While the facts are accurate, the speaker attribution in the citation is slightly off.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly focused and directly answers all three parts of the prompt without including any irrelevant information."
