  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states the duration (~1 week) and that congestion/stuffiness came first with a shift to predominantly runny nose later in the week, consistent with P-2 and P-3. However, it contains a major factual error regarding symptom pattern: it claims information on constant vs intermittent was not found and that the patient did not answer D-8, but the patient explicitly stated the symptoms were “pretty constant for the past week” (P-8). It also misattributes key information to doctor lines (e.g., duration is from patient P-1/P-2, not D-1/D-2), though this is secondary to the main clinical error.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements: (1) onset ~1 week prior; (2) initial symptom congestion; (3) predominant symptom shifted to rhinorrhea; (4) constant vs intermittent description (initial ‘on and off’ then clarified ‘pretty constant’); (5) no improvement prompting visit; (6) possible decongestant influence.\nGenerated Answer includes (1), (2), and (3). It omits (4) nuance entirely and, instead, incorrectly states it’s unavailable; it also omits (5) and (6). Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded in the transcript (week duration; stuffy first; now mostly running). But the claim that the patient did not answer the constant vs intermittent question is directly contradicted by P-8, making this a significant unfaithful element. Citation references are also unreliable (using D-lines where the patient provides the information).",
    "relevance": "The content is focused on the chronological progression of nasal symptoms and attempts to address onset, first symptom, change over the week, and constancy/intermittency. No major tangents, but the incorrect handling of the constancy/intermittency part slightly reduces the usefulness while still remaining on-topic."

  "summary": "The answer captures onset and the shift from initial congestion to predominant rhinorrhea, but it incorrectly states that constancy/intermittency information was absent despite explicit transcript evidence, and it misses several key nuances from the Gold Answer."
