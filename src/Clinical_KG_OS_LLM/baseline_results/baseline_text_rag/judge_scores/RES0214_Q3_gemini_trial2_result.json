  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (fever and sore throat) and the specific piece of vaccination information (no flu shot) that influenced the doctor's differential diagnosis. It matches the primary facts stated in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points included in the Gold Answer: 1) The 'broader symptom cluster' (muscle aches and stuffy nose) which the doctor summarized in D-24. 2) The epidemiological context regarding the patient's husband having similar symptoms, which the doctor explicitly cited as a reason to prioritize ruling out COVID-19. It covers roughly 50% of the nuanced detail provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript. The citations (D-1, D-53, D-54) accurately reflect the dialogue where these symptoms and the vaccination status were discussed.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question without including any irrelevant information."
