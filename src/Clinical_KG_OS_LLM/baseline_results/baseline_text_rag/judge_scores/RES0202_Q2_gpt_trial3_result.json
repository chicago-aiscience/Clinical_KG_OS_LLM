  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All items stated in the Generated Answer match the Gold Answer and the transcript: COVID swab with 24–48h results, isolate 14 days, isolate from younger sister, and ER/return precautions for high temp, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, or fainting. No contradictory or incorrect statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer includes: (1) COVID swab and timing, (2) 14-day isolation, (3) isolate from younger sister, (4) ER precautions. It omits several Gold Answer elements: acknowledgment of possible false negatives, that a negative test could still be another circulating viral illness, the plan to wait for swab results/supportive-observational approach with no medications, and the school’s requirement for a COVID test to return. Overall coverage is partial (~70% of the Gold Answer’s key management points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by D-44 (and consistent with the transcript). No apparent hallucinations or additions beyond what was said.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested management measures: diagnostic test, isolation instructions/duration, and the specific household member to isolate from, plus relevant escalation instructions."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, faithful, and highly relevant, but it misses several management details present in the Gold Answer (false-negative/alternate viral illness guidance, supportive/wait-and-see plan, and school testing requirement)."
