  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The statements included are consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, soreness behind the knee leading to discovery, and bringing the tick in a plastic container are supported by P-1. The comparison that the current tick was less engorged than the prior one is supported by P-3/P-4, and the “small bug vs swollen grape” framing is consistent with D-4 and the patient’s confirmation that this tick was “pretty small” (P-4). No clear factual contradictions are introduced; the main issue is omission/truncation rather than error.",
    "completeness": "Major elements from the Gold Answer are missing or cut off. Missing timeline details include: the patient’s explicit uncertainty about when/where she acquired the tick and hope it was from hiking rather than gardening (P-1), discovery being “earlier today” (D-1/P-1), the doctor’s estimate that it could have been attached >72 hours (D-6), and the hiking location (Strathroy) (P-12). Missing prior-episode comparison details include: the prior bullseye/target rash and antibiotic treatment (P-3), and the contrast that the current episode has only localized redness/tenderness and no larger bullseye rash (P-6). The “Symptoms” bullet is incomplete/truncated.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are grounded in the transcript (primarily P-1, P-3, D-4/P-4). No hallucinated symptoms, test results, or treatments are added. The answer is incomplete but what is present is verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays on the question’s requested themes (timeline and comparison to prior tick bite) and does not introduce irrelevant tangents. However, it only partially addresses the question and ends mid-sentence, reducing how well it addresses the full prompt."

  "summary": "The generated answer is factually accurate and well-grounded but is substantially incomplete (including a truncated section), omitting key timeline and prior-episode comparison details such as uncertainty of exposure timing, the >72-hour estimate, bullseye rash, and antibiotic treatment."
