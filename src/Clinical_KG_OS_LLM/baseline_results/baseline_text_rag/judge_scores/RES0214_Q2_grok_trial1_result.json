  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the current medication regimen as multivitamins (P-40), the drug allergy as penicillin (P-37), and the specific adverse reaction as a rash (P-38), which are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) multivitamins only (P-40), (2) pre-diabetic monitoring glucose but no prescription meds (P-33), (3) no high blood pressure (P-34), (4) no cholesterol issues (P-35), (5) penicillin allergy (P-37), (6) rash reaction (P-38), (7) no trouble breathing (P-39), (8) clinical relevance. Generated covers (1), (5), (6) fully (~50-60% core coverage), misses elaborative points (2-4,7-8); main question elements addressed but not exhaustive.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (multivitamins P-40, penicillin allergy P-37, rash P-38) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations; no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer precisely addresses the question's three components (medication regimen, drug allergy, specific adverse reaction) with no off-topic content or tangents."
