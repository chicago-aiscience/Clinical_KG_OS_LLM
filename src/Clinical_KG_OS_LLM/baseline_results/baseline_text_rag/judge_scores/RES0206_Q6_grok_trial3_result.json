  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details physical exam (vitals incl. temp reference, chest auscultation), COVID swab and labs, preliminary impression (COPD exacerbation + infection), disposition based on labs/vitals, consult attending, patient agreement. Generated covers exams (physical, vitals, chest), COVID swab (minor inaccuracy: 'rule out infection' vs. 'rule out covid'), consult, criteria (labs/vitals). Misses impression, explicit broader labs in tests section, temp reference, patient agreement. Core facts consistent, minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: exams (physical/vitals/chest), COVID swab, consult, criteria (labs/vitals). Missed: preliminary clinical impression, explicit mention of broader labs as tests, temp context from earlier, patient agreement. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from [D-43]: physical exam/vitals/chest listen, COVID swab, labs/vitals for decision, consult attending. 'Rule out infection' is plausible from context (infection mentioned as COPD trigger) but transcript specifies 'rule out covid'; no fabrication, citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly lists exams, tests, consultations, decision criteria from [D-43], perfectly matching question structure with no off-topic content."
