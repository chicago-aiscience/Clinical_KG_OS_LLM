  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition ruled out by both (supported by transcript), specifies 'swab' test (contextually COVID swab), 48 hours turnaround, and isolation instructions, matching Gold Answer's core facts; minor citation error (D-1 instead of P-1) but no substantive factual discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covers all four key question elements from Gold: condition (COVID-19), test (swab), turnaround (48 hours), instructions (isolation); misses Gold's extras like 'today', 'COVID' specifier for swab, 'further instructions from public health', and context (80-99% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [P-1/D-39]; minor citation inaccuracy (D-1 for patient's statement, actually P-1) but content grounded, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response as bullet points matching the four-part question precisely, no off-topic content."
