  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer regarding the timeline of events (hiking on Friday, gardening on Saturday) and the physical comparison of the ticks (small bug vs. swollen grape).",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete. While it covers the timeline and the engorgement comparison, it cuts off mid-sentence before addressing the symptom comparison (bullseye rash vs. local redness). It also omits the doctor's 72-hour attachment estimate and the specific location (left knee joint).",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made are directly supported by the provided transcript. The citations (P-1, P-3, D-4) are used correctly to ground the facts about the timeline and the appearance of the tick.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's specific questions about the timeline and comparison, though it fails to finish the second part of the comparison due to truncation."
