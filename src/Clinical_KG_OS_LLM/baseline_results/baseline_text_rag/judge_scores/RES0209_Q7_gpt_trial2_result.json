  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly notes diagnosis at age 8 and baseline bronchodilator use about once every two weeks. However, it incorrectly attributes the diagnosis to D-2/D-3 rather than the patient’s statement (P-2), and it states symptoms for the “past week” without acknowledging the later clarification to “last two weeks” (P-13). It is also cut off mid-word (“whe…”) and omits several key symptom/usage nuances that are part of the evolution described in the Gold Answer (e.g., near-daily use 5–6x/week explicitly, nocturnal symptoms, wheeze frequency exceeding bronchodilator use).",
    "completeness": "Covers only a small subset of the Gold Answer: (1) diagnosis at age 8 and (2) baseline bronchodilator use once every two weeks, plus partial mention of current cough/SOB. It misses: two-year timeline (now age 10), explicit escalation to 5–6 times/week, clarification of 2-week duration, wheezing increase, chest tightness, nighttime symptoms, statement that wheezing occurs more often than bronchodilator use (uses only when very bad), prior triggers/seasonality (exercise/cold/winter/spring), and lack of infectious precipitant. Overall coverage is well under half of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The included claims (baseline use once every two weeks; near-nonstop cough; shortness of breath) are supported by the transcript. However, the time course is stated as “past week” only, which conflicts with the transcript’s clarification to two weeks, and the citation for diagnosis is not faithful to who said it. The response is also truncated, limiting verifiability of what it intended to add.",
    "relevance": "What is present is on-topic (asthma symptom/bronchodilator evolution), but it does not fully answer the question due to truncation and missing the requested progression through baseline to current exacerbation."
