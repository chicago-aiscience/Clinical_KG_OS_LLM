  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the clinician's plan as described in the Gold Answer: COVID-19 swab (D-29), suggestion of medication change (D-43), and consultation with supervising physician followed by return (D-43). There are no factual errors or contradictions; minor details like the negative infectious screening context or patient's regimen specifics are omitted but not misrepresented.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnostic test (COVID swab, D-29), medication regimen change suggestion (D-43), next steps (consultation with supervising physician and return shortly, D-43). Missed: contextual details like despite negative screening answers, explanation of why med change is notable (only rescue inhaler, increased use P-5/P-8), sports goal (D-42), trainee status implication, and earlier consult reference (D-29). Covers ~85% of Gold's elaborated points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'COVID-19 swab' from D-29 ('covid swab just because of the times...'), 'little change to your medications' from D-43, 'consult with the supervising physician and return' from D-43 ('go talk to the doctor... come back and see you shortly'). Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured perfectly around the question's specified elements (diagnostic test in COVID context, med regimen change, supervising physician consultation), with no off-topic content."
