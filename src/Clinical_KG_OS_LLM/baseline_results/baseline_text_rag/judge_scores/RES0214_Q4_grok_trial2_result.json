  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID swab test from [D-53] and accurately captures the core rationale from [D-53] that the husband's similar symptoms make COVID-19 the first to rule out; it mentions fever and sore throat which align with the patient's presentation discussed throughout, consistent with Gold but omits deeper epidemiological nuance like self-isolation urgency and flu shot; minor discrepancies in depth but core facts match.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: test ordered (COVID swab [D-53]), prioritization due to husband symptoms and explicit doctor statement [D-53]; missed: detailed household transmission timing [P-19], self-isolation instructions [D-53/D-54] as reinforcing rationale, explicit epidemiological context phrasing, influenza as secondary after no flu shot [P-53/D-54]; covers ~60-70% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'covid swab' in [D-53], prioritization rationale quoting/paraphrasing [D-53] accurately, symptoms (fever/sore throat) from patient history [P-1/P-3/etc.], husband symptoms [P-19/D-53]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (test ordered and exact rationale for prioritizing COVID over flu) with no tangents or off-topic content."
