  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains only the word “Based” and provides no symptom details. Since it does not state any of the symptoms described in the Gold Answer, it fails to provide a factually correct response to the question.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer lists multiple resolved and ongoing symptoms (timeline of productive→dry cough, sore throat, runny nose/flu symptoms, cough frequency/trigger pattern, chest soreness with coughing, and pertinent negatives). The Generated Answer includes none of these elements, so it covers essentially 0% of required content.",
    "faithfulness": "No clinical claims are made in the Generated Answer beyond an incomplete fragment (“Based”), so there are no hallucinated or transcript-contradicting statements. However, it also does not ground any clinical content in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for specific symptoms during the two-week illness (resolved and ongoing). The Generated Answer does not address the question and provides no relevant information."
