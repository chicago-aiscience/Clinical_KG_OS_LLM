  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient had not tried any OTC medications/treatments and that the clinician recommended COVID testing and self-isolation. However, it cites the wrong transcript line for the swab test and isolation instructions (these occur in D-39, not D-40). No other clear factual contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "Includes: (1) patient tried nothing OTC, (2) COVID swab test recommendation, (3) instruction to self-isolate until results and possibly longer if symptoms persist. Misses key Gold Answer elements: (a) patient takes no regular medications (D-24/P-24), (b) turnaround time for results (“a day or two”), and (c) mention of possible additional tests and plan to consult supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims are supported by the transcript (patient tried nothing; COVID swab test; isolation guidance). But the answer misattributes these to D-40 rather than D-39, and it omits other transcript-supported details rather than adding new unsupported claims. Overall mostly grounded with a citation error.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what was tried before the visit and what was recommended during the consultation, focusing on treatments/instructions without irrelevant content."
