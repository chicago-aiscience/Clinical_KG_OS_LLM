  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: general infectious process supported by fevers + fatigue + muscle aches; COVID concern could not be ruled out due to difficulty breathing plus emerging sore throat and cough. Generated answer correctly identifies fevers, fatigue, muscle aches for infection and sore throat/cough for COVID concern, but (1) incorrectly includes difficulty breathing as evidence for the *general infectious process* (the gold distinguishes it as part of the COVID-concerning respiratory picture), and (2) omits difficulty breathing as a key symptom supporting why COVID could not yet be ruled out. These are meaningful discrepancies, though the overall structure is partly right.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold: \n- Infection evidence: fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (covered).\n- COVID not ruled out: difficulty breathing + sore throat + cough (missing difficulty breathing).\n- Note that loss of taste/smell not cited by doctor in summary (not mentioned in generated answer, which is acceptable).\nOverall, it captures some but not all key elements, especially missing shortness of breath in the COVID justification.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms mentioned in the generated answer (fever, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) are present in D-36. No additional symptoms (e.g., loss of taste/smell) are fabricated. The main issue is categorization/interpretation rather than adding unsupported facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (symptoms cited for general infection; symptoms cited for not ruling out COVID) without irrelevant material."
