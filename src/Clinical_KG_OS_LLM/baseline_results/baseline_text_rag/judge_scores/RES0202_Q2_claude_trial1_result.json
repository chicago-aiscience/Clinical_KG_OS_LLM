  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all the key management recommendations from the doctor. The COVID swab test with 24-48 hour results is correctly stated. The 14-day isolation period is accurate. The isolation from the younger sister is correctly identified, though the doctor said 'if possible' which is a minor omission. The ER precautions are accurately summarized. All factual information aligns with the Gold Answer and source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most essential points but misses some details present in the Gold Answer. It omits: (1) the possibility of false-negative COVID results, (2) the acknowledgment that it could be another viral illness if negative, (3) the school's requirement for COVID testing to return, (4) the supportive/observational approach with no medications prescribed, (5) the mother's acknowledgment about viral illness management, and (6) the detail that the household includes the parents. The answer captures approximately 70% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citation markers (D-44). The information about COVID testing, isolation duration, isolating from the sister, and ER precautions are all grounded in the doctor's statements at D-44. No hallucinated content is present. The formatting and organization differ from the Gold Answer but the content is faithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: diagnostic tests (COVID swab), isolation instructions and duration (14 days), and specific household member to isolate from (younger sister). It also includes the relevant red flag symptoms for ER visits. The answer is well-focused and organized with clear bullet points addressing each aspect of the question without irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides accurate and relevant information that directly addresses the question's components. All facts are correct and verifiable in the transcript with proper citations. However, it covers only about 70% of the key points found in the Gold Answer, missing contextual details about false negatives, alternative diagnoses, school requirements, treatment approach, and complete household composition. The answer demonstrates strong correctness, faithfulness, and relevance but moderate completeness."
