  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately captures the start of the illness on Wednesday evening (seemed fine, then dry cough), which aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer is extremely incomplete. It only addresses the first day (Wednesday) and completely fails to describe the evolution on Thursday and Friday, the appearance and severity of the cough over time, the emergence of the fever, fatigue, or the decreased appetite mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The single claim made regarding Wednesday is fully supported by the transcript [P-1] and [P-12]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant as it cuts off after the first point. It fails to address the 'day by day' evolution through Friday as specifically requested by the prompt."
