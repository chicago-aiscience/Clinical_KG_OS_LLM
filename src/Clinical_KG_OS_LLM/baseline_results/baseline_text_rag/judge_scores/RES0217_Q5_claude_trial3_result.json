    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains the core facts but lacks precision in key details. It correctly identifies that the Friday/Saturday activities led to the >72 hour inference and that Strathroy's position on the map contributed to the treatment decision. However, it incorrectly cites [D-5] as source for the 72-hour calculation when the correct citation is [D-6]. The answer also misses the specific detail that the patient discovered the tick 'earlier today' and that there was 'a little bit of time' between outdoor activities and discovery.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the two main components requested: (1) how the hiking/gardening timeline contributed to >72 hour estimate, and (2) how Strathroy's map position justified treatment. However, it omits several key supporting details present in the Gold Answer: the patient's uncertainty about when attachment occurred ('I don't really know when I got it'), the specific timing of discovery ('earlier today'), the doctor's observation about time elapsed, the explicit quote about moving forward with antibiotics as prophylactic, and the specific geographic detail of 'along the creek.' Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript but has citation errors. The claim about Friday/Saturday activities and >72 hour duration is verifiable in [D-6], not [D-5] as cited. The Strathroy map reference is correctly sourced to [D-12, D-13]. The statement about 'moving forward with prophylactic antibiotics' is accurately reflected in [D-6] and [D-13] but not explicitly cited. No hallucinated content, but imprecise citation reduces faithfulness score.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) the contribution of hiking/gardening to the >72 hour estimate, and (2) the use of Strathroy's map position to justify treatment. It stays focused on these two elements without tangential information. The response could be more detailed but maintains complete relevance to the question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main causal relationships between the patient's activities and the treatment decision, but lacks the detailed supporting evidence present in the Gold Answer. It has minor citation errors and omits important contextual details like the patient's uncertainty about timing and the doctor's specific reasoning steps. The answer is relevant and mostly accurate but incomplete in its coverage of the clinical reasoning process."
