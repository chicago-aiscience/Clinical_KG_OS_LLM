  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts of the doctor's plan from D-37, including listening to heart and lungs, quick physical exam, consulting the supervising doctor, reviewing (paraphrased as symptoms, while Gold/transcript says 'everything talked about'), and returning to discuss next steps. Minor discrepancy in phrasing 'patient's symptoms' vs. 'everything you talked about', but no factual errors or contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: physical exam components (heart/lungs auscultation and quick exam), collaborative process (consult supervising doctor, review discussion, return to discuss next steps). Missed: reference to foreshadowing in D-1, patient agreement in P-37, explanation of no diagnosis/meds yet and trainee context. Covers ~85% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in D-37: 'quick listen to your heart and lungs', 'quick physical exam', 'go get the doctor that I'm working with', 'go over everything you talked about' (symptoms are the core of discussion), 'come back and talk to you about where to go from here'. Accurate citation, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses the question about the end-of-consultation plan, specified exam components, and process for next steps, with no off-topic content."
