  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: COVID swab and chest X-ray as tests [D-43], isolation until results [D-43], and continued isolation if symptoms persist even after negative result [D-43]. No errors or contradictions, though it omits the explicit assessment phrasing ('symptoms in line with common symptoms of COVID-19').",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Assessment (symptoms in line with COVID-19) - missed; 2) Tests (COVID swab, chest X-ray) - covered; 3) Reasons for X-ray (breathing issues, COPD) - missed; 4) Isolation until results - covered; 5) Continued isolation if symptomatic post-negative - covered; 6) Heads up/consult doctor - missed; 7) Patient agreement - missed. Covers ~80% of core points specified in question (tests, isolation, conditions), missing assessment and extras.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-43] of transcript (swab, xray, isolation until results, continue if symptoms even if negative). Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly focused on question's elements (assessment/plan incl. tests, isolation instructions, continued isolation conditions); bullet structure directly addresses without tangents."
