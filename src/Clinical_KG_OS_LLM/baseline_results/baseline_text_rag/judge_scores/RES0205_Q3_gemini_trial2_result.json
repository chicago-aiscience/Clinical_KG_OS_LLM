  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis (COVID-19), the result (negative), and the primary evidence (hospital worker, persistent cough, and colleague concern). However, it uses incorrect citations, attributing information to speaker 'D-35' (the doctor) when the patient provided the details in 'P-35'.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses some specific details found in the Gold Answer, such as the specific initial flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose) that contributed to the investigation and the timing of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset).",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made are grounded in the transcript, but the citation of 'D-35' is technically a hallucination of the speaker label for that specific information, as the content resides in P-35/P-36.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and provides a concise response to all three parts of the prompt without unnecessary filler."
