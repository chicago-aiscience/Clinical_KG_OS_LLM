  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, correctly states that a COVID swab was ordered to rule it out, and correctly gives the expected turnaround time as 24–48 hours—fully consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript (D-52).",
    "completeness": "It includes all key requested elements from the Gold Answer: (1) alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), (2) specific test (COVID swab), and (3) turnaround time (24–48 hours). It does not add the optional contextual symptom examples from the Gold Answer, but those were not required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims are directly supported by the transcript (D-52). The citation to D-53 is unnecessary (D-53 is just a closing), but it does not introduce any additional unsupported factual claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the exact items asked: alternative diagnosis, test ordered, and result timeframe, with no irrelevant tangents."
