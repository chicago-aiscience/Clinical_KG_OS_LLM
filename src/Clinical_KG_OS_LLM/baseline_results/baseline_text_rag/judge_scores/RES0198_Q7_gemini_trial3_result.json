  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the duration (one week), the initial symptom (stuffy nose), and the shift to rhinorrhea (runny nose). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the frequency of symptoms; it claims the patient did not answer whether the symptoms were constant or intermittent, while the transcript explicitly shows the patient answering 'It's been pretty constant for the past week' [P-8].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the nuance regarding the patient's initial description of 'on and off' symptoms [P-1] compared to the later 'constant' clarification [P-8]. It also omits the detail about over-the-counter decongestants potentially influencing the shift in symptoms. It fails to provide an answer for one of the three main parts of the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucinated claim that the patient did not answer the doctor's question about the constancy of symptoms. This directly contradicts the transcript where P-8 provides a clear response to D-8.",
    "relevance": "The response is partially relevant as it addresses the symptom onset and progression. However, it fails to provide the requested information for the final part of the question despite the information being available in the source text."
