  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the main condition to rule out, correctly states that a swab test was ordered, correctly gives the turnaround time as 24–48 hours, and correctly names an alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if COVID testing is negative. These all match the Gold Answer and the transcript (D-52). No factual errors noted.",
    "completeness": "It includes all elements asked in the question (rule-out condition, test type, turnaround time, and alternative diagnosis if negative). Compared to the full Gold Answer, it omits additional details mentioned there (14-day isolation, public health contact tracing if positive, and supportive management), but those are not explicitly required by the question. Overall coverage is nearly complete relative to the Gold Answer’s content.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript at D-52. No added or speculative claims. Citations provided align with the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question with no extraneous information."
