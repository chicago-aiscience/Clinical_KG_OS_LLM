  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and the 24-48 hour turnaround time. All facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key components requested in the question: (1) alternative diagnosis (COVID), (2) specific diagnostic test (COVID swab), and (3) turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, it lacks the contextual detail about symptom overlap that the Gold Answer provides, such as the specific mention of worsening cough, shortness of breath, and chills.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript. The doctor explicitly states in [D-52]: 'because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid we'll also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours.' The citation to [D-52, D-53] is accurate, though [D-53] only contains acknowledgment.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question without any irrelevant information. It is concise and focused on exactly what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately and faithfully answers all three components of the question with correct information from the transcript. It identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the test, and the 24-48 hour turnaround time. While factually complete, it lacks some contextual detail about symptom overlap present in the Gold Answer, resulting in a minor completeness deduction. The answer is highly relevant and grounded in the source material."
