  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies symptom duration (1 week), first symptom (stuffy nose), and progression to mostly runny nose, aligning with Gold and transcript [P-1-P-3]. However, it inaccurately claims no information on constant/intermittent nature and that patient did not answer D-8, directly contradicting P-8 ('pretty constant') and Gold's coverage of this; also uses incorrect citations (e.g., D-3/D-4 instead of P-3). These are significant factual errors/contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1-week onset [P-1,P-2]; initial stuffy [P-3]; shift to runny [P-3]; decongestant influence [P-10]; initial 'on and off' [P-1] to 'pretty constant' [P-8]; no improvement [P-1]. Generated covers duration, initial stuffy, shift to runny (~30-40%); misses decongestants, full pattern (on/off to constant), no improvement detail.",
    "faithfulness": "Verifiable: week duration [P-2], stuffy first to runny [P-3]. Unverifiable/wrong: cites D-1/D-2/D-3/D-4 (speaker errors, D-4 irrelevant); falsely states no answer to D-8 despite P-8 response. Multiple citation errors and hallucinated claim of no response.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses duration, first symptom, progression; attempts constant/intermittent but errs. No off-topic content, mostly focused on question."
