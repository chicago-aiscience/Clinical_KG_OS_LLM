  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient tried decongestants and felt it worked 'a little bit' (directly from P-10), and that the doctor recommended Tylenol Cold (from D-39). These facts are fully consistent with both the transcript and Gold Answer, with no errors or contradictions, though it omits some nuance.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) patient tried OTC decongestants [P-10] - covered; (2) detailed assessment ('worked a little bit' with reasoning about runny nose) [P-10] - partially covered (basic phrase yes, reasoning missed); (3) doctor recommended hydration and OTC like Tylenol Cold [D-39] - partially covered (Tylenol yes, hydration missed); (4) supportive care context, viral takes weeks [D-39] - missed. Covers core elements (~80%) but misses details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'decongestants... worked a little bit' in P-10; 'Tylenol cold' in D-39. Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses all three parts of the question (medication tried, assessment, OTC recommendation) with no off-topic content."
