  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately recaps the doctor's summary from D-58, matching the Gold Answer's listed findings (dry cough duration, fever, headache, no sputum, no recent sick contacts except brother, no asthma) with no factual errors or contradictions; minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'no recent sick contacts' vs. Gold's 'no one in recent close contact') do not alter facts, and Jessica's goal from P-60 is correctly stated without error.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points covered: doctor's recap (3-4 day dry cough/fever/headache ✓, no sputum ✓, sick contacts/brother exception ✓, no asthma ✓), Jessica's primary goal (medicine question from P-60 ✓); missed: Claritin/medications exclusion, doctor's framing of visit purpose/next steps check, P-61 desire to go home/lay down (impact on functioning); covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: doctor's summary precisely from D-58 (e.g., 'three to four day dry cough... little bit of fever... headache... bringing anything up... no one in contact... little brother... common cold... don't have asthma'), Jessica's goal from P-60; citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by focusing solely on doctor's recapped findings from D-58 and Jessica's primary goal/next steps from P-60, with no off-topic content or tangents."
