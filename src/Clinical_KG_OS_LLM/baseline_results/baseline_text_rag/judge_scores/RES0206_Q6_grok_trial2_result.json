  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main elements of the plan from [D-43] including physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab, consultation with attending, and decision criteria based on labs and vital signs, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancies include not specifying the preliminary clinical impression of COPD exacerbation triggered by infection, phrasing the COVID swab as 'to rule out infection' instead of specifically 'rule out COVID,' and omitting the reference to temperature check from earlier dialogue, but these do not alter the core factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam including vitals and chest auscultation (fully), COVID swab (fully), labs implied in decision criteria (partially, as tests section only lists COVID swab), consultation with attending (fully), disposition criteria based on labs/vitals (fully). Missed: explicit mention of broader 'labs' as separate tests (beyond COVID), preliminary clinical impression, patient agreement, and temperature detail from [D-11]/[P-10]. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-43]: physical exam/vitals/chest ('I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest'), COVID swab ('covid swab'), consult attending ('talk to my attending'), decision on labs/vitals ('decide based on... your labs in your vital signs'). Minor phrasing 'rule out infection' aligns with context of suspected infection but transcript specifies 'rule out covid'; no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured as a direct, bullet-point list addressing exactly the question's elements (examinations, tests, consultations, decision criteria for ER admission vs. discharge), with no off-topic content or tangents."
