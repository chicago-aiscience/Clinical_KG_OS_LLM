  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the examinations, tests, and consultation steps mentioned by the doctor.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points. It includes the physical exam, vitals, chest auscultation, COVID swab, attending consultation, and decision criteria. It misses the preliminary clinical impression (COPD exacerbation/infection) which was included in the gold answer, and it excludes 'labs' from the specific 'Tests' section, although it mentions them under 'Decision Criteria'.",

    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured according to the categories requested in the prompt (examinations, tests, consultations, criteria)."
