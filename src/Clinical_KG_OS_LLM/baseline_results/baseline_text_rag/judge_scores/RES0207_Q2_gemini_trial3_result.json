  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the medication (Keppra) and the specific circumstances surrounding the missed dose (daughter's birthday, change in dinner routine) as documented in the transcript and Gold Answer. There are no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses two details found in the Gold Answer: 1) It does not explicitly name the chronic condition (epilepsy), and 2) It omits the patient's acknowledgment that the missed dose likely led to the seizure they experienced. However, it addresses the core components of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript and use appropriate citations ([P-23], [P-24]). There is no evidence of hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question asked without providing unnecessary biographical information found elsewhere in the transcript."
