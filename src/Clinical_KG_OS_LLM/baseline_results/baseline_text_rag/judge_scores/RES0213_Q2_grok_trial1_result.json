  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states 'Information not found in provided excerpts,' which directly contradicts the Gold Answer's factual details from the transcript (e.g., Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer in [P-6]; multivitamin in [P-25]). No facts are correct; it's entirely inaccurate.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: OTC for pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer, ineffective); regular supplement (multivitamin); no Rx meds. Generated Answer covers 0% of these points, missing everything.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims information is absent, but all details are verifiable in transcript ([P-6], [P-25]); this is a hallucination of absence, not grounded at all.",
    "relevance": "Does not address the question about medications/supplements and effectiveness; instead, incorrectly dismisses the query as unanswerable from excerpts."
