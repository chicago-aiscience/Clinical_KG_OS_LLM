  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53], matching Gold. For rationale, it captures the core prioritization due to husband's similar symptoms and partial quote from [D-53], but simplifies by emphasizing fever/sore throat (which is in transcript but secondary in Gold) and omits epidemiological urgency, self-isolation, and flu shot details; minor discrepancies but core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: test (swab [D-53]), prioritization due to husband symptoms [P-19/D-53]. Missed: full epidemiological context emphasis, self-isolation instructions [D-53/D-54], explicit sequencing of flu mention after COVID rule-out, no flu shot [P-53/D-54]. Covers ~80-90% of key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: swab order [D-53], fever/sore throat presentation [D-53], husband symptoms [P-19/D-53], prioritization quote [D-53]. Accurate citations, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of question (test and rationale for prioritization over flu) with focused content, no off-topic elements."
