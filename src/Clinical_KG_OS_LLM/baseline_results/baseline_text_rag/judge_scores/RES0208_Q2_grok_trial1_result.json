  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies Avodart for prostate issues (urinating difficulties, matching P-25 description of 'prostate a little big' and urinating issues) and Tums for reflux, consistent with Gold. The reason for stopping previous reflux med ('figured out foods that help' paraphrased as identifying triggers and dietary sufficiency) is a minor rephrasing but factually aligns with transcript and Gold's 'figured out the foods that helped'. Citations have minor inaccuracy (P-27 for Avodart instead of P-26), but no contradictions. Omits dutasteride name, no allergies, doctor's response, but these do not affect core factual accuracy vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: Avodart for enlarged prostate (phrased as prostate/urination issues), Tums for reflux, change to regimen (stopped previous med due to dietary management). Missed: explicit 'dutasteride', 'benign prostatic hyperplasia' terminology, 'OTC antacid'/'as-needed here and there', doctor's 'Great' response, no allergies. Covers core meds, conditions, and change/why (80-99% of essentials).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: Avodart in P-26 (said by patient), prostate in P-25; Tums/reflux/change in P-27 verbatim basis. Paraphrase of 'foods that help' to 'trigger foods/dietary changes sufficient' is plausible and directly derived from transcript without fabrication. Citations verifiable (minor citation shift). No hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists current meds with conditions, details exact change to reflux regimen and why, using transcript citations. No tangents or off-topic content; perfectly matches question scope."
