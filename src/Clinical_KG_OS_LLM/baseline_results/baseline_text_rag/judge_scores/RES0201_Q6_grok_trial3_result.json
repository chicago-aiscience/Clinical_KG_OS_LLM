  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key elements of the doctor's plan from D-43, including the two diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), isolation until results, and continued isolation if symptoms persist even if negative, with no factual errors or contradictions compared to the Gold Answer's core facts, though it omits the explicit assessment quote and contextual details like COPD relevance.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), isolation instructions (until results), condition for continued isolation (symptoms persist even if negative); missed: explicit overall assessment ('symptoms in line with common symptoms of COVID-19'), rationale for chest X-ray (difficulty breathing and COPD), framing as 'heads up' and consultation with supervising doctor, patient acknowledgment – covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in D-43 of the transcript (COVID swab, chest xray, isolate until results, continue if symptoms even if negative); citations are accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is perfectly focused on the question's elements (assessment/management plan, specific tests, isolation instructions, conditions for continued isolation) using concise bullets with no off-topic content."
