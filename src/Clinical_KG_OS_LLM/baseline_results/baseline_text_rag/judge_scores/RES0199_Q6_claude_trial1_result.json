  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all key components of the management plan: COVID-19 swab testing, 14-day isolation, public health contact tracing if positive, and supportive care measures including hydration, nutrition, sleep, and use of Tylenol/NSAIDs. The facts align with the Gold Answer without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major elements from the Gold Answer: diagnostic test (COVID-19 swab), isolation duration (14 days), contact tracing conditions (if positive), and supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics, NSAIDs). However, it omits minor details present in the Gold Answer such as the 24-48 hour timeline for test results, the alternative diagnosis possibility (viral illness), and the specific mention that no prescription medications were ordered. These omissions represent approximately 15-20% of the detail in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The answer accurately cites this source and does not include any fabricated information. The summary is grounded entirely in what the doctor stated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by providing the diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care recommendations. It is well-organized and focused entirely on answering what was asked without extraneous information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-organized response that correctly identifies all major components of the management plan. It is factually consistent with both the transcript and Gold Answer, with proper citation. The response loses minimal points for completeness due to omitting minor details like the test result timeline (24-48 hours) and the mention of alternative viral illness diagnosis, which represent about 15-20% of the Gold Answer's content. However, all core elements are covered accurately."
