  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the doctor’s recap in D-58: 3–4 days of dry cough, some fever, headache, no sputum, no asthma, and no sick contacts except the brother with a cold ~2 weeks prior. It also correctly states Jessica’s stated goal in P-60 (to know if she needs to take medicine). No statements contradict the Gold Answer or transcript. The only issue is omission (not inaccuracy): it does not mention the doctor’s point that she is not taking medications aside from Claritin, nor Jessica’s additional comment in P-61 about wanting to go home and lie down.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key recap items: duration/type of cough, fever, headache, no sputum, sick contact exception (brother), no asthma, and Jessica’s primary goal (whether she needs medicine). Misses two Gold Answer elements: (1) doctor’s recap that she is not taking meds aside from Claritin; (2) Jessica’s additional priority in P-61 (wanting to go home and rest) and the framing around “next steps/where to go from here.” Overall ~80–90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are directly supported by D-58 and P-60. No clear hallucinations or unverifiable additions. The answer stays within what was said in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question: the doctor’s summarized findings and Jessica’s stated goal regarding next steps. No meaningful tangents."
