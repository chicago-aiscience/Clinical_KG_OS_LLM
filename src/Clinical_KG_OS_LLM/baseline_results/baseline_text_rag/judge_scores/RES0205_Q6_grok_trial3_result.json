  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer and transcript [D-37]: specific physical exam components (listening to heart and lungs, quick physical exam), consultation with the supervising doctor, review (paraphrased as 'patient's symptoms' vs. 'everything you talked about' but factually consistent), and returning to discuss next steps. No factual errors or contradictions; minor phrasing differences do not impact accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: physical exam components (heart/lungs auscultation and quick exam), consultation process, review, and return to discuss next steps (covers ~90% of Gold's core plan description). Missed: explicit mention of multi-step structure foreshadowed in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], 'together' collaboration phrasing, and note on no diagnosis/meds (contextual but not core to plan).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-37]: 'quick listen to your heart and lungs', 'quick physical exam', 'go get the doctor that I'm working with', 'go over everything you talked about' (symptoms are central), 'come back and talk... where to go from here'. Accurate citation; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by detailing the end-of-consultation plan [D-37], specified exam components, and decision-making process; concise and on-topic with no tangents."
