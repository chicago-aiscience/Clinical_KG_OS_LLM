    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the chest X-ray and COVID swab as diagnostic tests, mentions the physical examination, and accurately describes the self-isolation instructions to stay away from everyone including the wife. However, it is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence. Compared to the Gold Answer, it misses: (1) the expected timeline of 24-48 hours for results, (2) the public health nurse follow-up detail, (3) the criteria for hospital admission versus discharge based on test results, and (4) the purpose/reasoning for the chest X-ray. The facts stated are correct but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It identifies three of the five main components (diagnostic tests, physical exam, self-isolation instructions) but provides incomplete details for self-isolation (cuts off) and completely omits two critical components: the expected timeline for test results (24-48 hours with public health nurse follow-up) and the disposition criteria (decision based on test results whether to admit or discharge). The answer also lacks the clinical reasoning provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citation to D-37 and D-38. The chest X-ray is mentioned in D-37, the COVID swab in D-37, the physical exam in D-37 and D-38, and the self-isolation instructions in D-37. There are no hallucinated facts. The answer is grounded in the source material, though it appears to be cut off prematurely.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about the doctor's management plan, covering diagnostic tests, physical examination, and self-isolation instructions. However, the question specifically asks for 'all diagnostic tests ordered, the physical examination planned, the specific self-isolation instructions given (and from whom), the expected timeline for test results, and the criteria mentioned for deciding between hospital admission and discharge.' The answer only partially addresses these components and is cut off before completion."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several key components of the management plan (diagnostic tests, physical exam, and partial self-isolation instructions) with accurate citations and no hallucinations. However, it is incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence, and omits critical information including the timeline for test results (24-48 hours), public health nurse follow-up, and the criteria for hospital admission versus discharge. While factually accurate for what it covers, it addresses less than 50% of the comprehensive management plan detailed in the Gold Answer."
