  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all stated elements of the management plan without any factual errors or contradictions compared to the Gold Answer; the test (COVID-19 swab), precautionary measures (self-isolation for patient and husband), and next steps (physical exam and further workup) are all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript citations provided.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) COVID-19 swab ordered [D-53] - covered; 2) self-isolation for patient and husband [D-53, D-54] - fully covered; 3) physical exam next [D-52] - covered; 4) consult supervising physician and return [D-55] - partially covered via 'investigate/work up further' but explicit consultation missed; 5) patient agreement [P-54] - not covered. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: COVID swab [D-53], self-isolate [D-53], keep to themselves [D-54], physical exam [D-52], investigate/work up [D-53]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question's elements (test ordered, precautionary measures for patient/husband, next steps), with no off-topic content."
