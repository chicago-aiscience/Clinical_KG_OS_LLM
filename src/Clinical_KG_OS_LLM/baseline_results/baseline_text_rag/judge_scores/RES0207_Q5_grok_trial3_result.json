  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key facts: missing Keppra dose due to birthday routine change [P-24], epilepsy diagnosis, and family history of epilepsy in mother [P-26]. These match the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancies include citing P-9 for diagnosis (actual explicit statement in P-8) and omitting patient acknowledgment of causation [P-9] and infrequency of seizures, but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: medication non-adherence (Keppra miss, reason [P-23,P-24]), hereditary risk (family/mom [P-26]), basic relation to diagnosis. Missed: clinician's specific family question context [D-26], explicit patient link to seizure causation [P-9], normal infrequency/well-control [P-9], and emphasis on combination of factors. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Keppra miss and reason [P-23,P-24], epilepsy [P-8], family history [P-26]. Minor citation issue (P-9 for diagnosis, but P-9 supports med non-adherence context); no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses hereditary (family/mom) and medication (Keppra miss) risks for seizure, and family history relation to epilepsy diagnosis; concise and focused with no off-topic content."
