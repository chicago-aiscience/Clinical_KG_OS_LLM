  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All included elements match the Gold Answer and the transcript: COVID swab with 24–48h turnaround, 14-day isolation due to COVID-like symptoms, isolating from the younger sister, and ER/return precautions (high fever, neurologic symptoms such as seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). No incorrect or contradictory statements were made.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) COVID swab and timing, (2) 14-day isolation, (3) isolate from younger sister, (4) ER precautions. Missing from the Gold Answer: mention of possible false-negative result, possibility of another viral illness if swab negative, the explicit plan to wait for results/supportive-observational approach (no medications), and the school requirement for a COVID test to return. Overall, about 4 of ~7 key Gold points are included (~57%).",
    "faithfulness": "Statements are directly supported by D-44; no new/unverifiable claims were added. The answer stays within what is stated in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question’s requested items (diagnostic test, isolation instructions and duration, and who to isolate from) and includes relevant return-to-care precautions without tangents."
