  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The single substantive claim is that the child was fine earlier on Wednesday and then developed a dry cough. This matches the transcript’s description that he seemed fine when he got home from school Wednesday and developed a “little dry cough” that night [P-1]. Minor imprecision: the answer says “seemed fine at school,” whereas the transcript specifies “got home from school… seemed fine.” No other (potentially incorrect) details are provided.",
    "completeness": "Gold answer key points include: (1) cough began Wednesday night and was dry; (2) Thursday cough persisted and worsened plus notable fatigue; (3) Friday cough worsened further, fever first appeared (>100°F, possibly 100.1–101), and other new symptoms (decreased appetite/possible loss of taste, mild runny nose, fatigue); (4) explicit correction from 5 days to 3 days; (5) day-by-day progression statement [P-12]. Generated answer only covers the start of symptoms on Wednesday and omits Thursday/Friday evolution, fever timing/temperature, fatigue, appetite/taste, runny nose, and the 3-day clarification.",
    "faithfulness": "What is stated is largely grounded in [P-1] (fine then dry cough Wednesday night). The phrase “fine at school” is not directly stated (it was “got home from school… seemed fine”), but it is a minor paraphrase rather than a new invented symptom. No other unverifiable claims are present.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for a day-by-day account from Wednesday evening through Friday, including onset and progression of cough, emergence of fever, and other symptoms (fatigue, decreased appetite). The generated answer only addresses Wednesday and does not answer the rest of the requested timeline."
