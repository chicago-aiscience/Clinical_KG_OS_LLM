    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19), the test (swab), the timeframe (48 hours), and the primary instruction (isolation). There is a minor citation error where P-1 is referred to as D-1, but the factual content is consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses one specific detail from the Gold Answer: the doctor's instruction that the patient would receive 'further instructions from public health' once the results were back.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript. The instruction for isolation and the turnaround time are accurately pulled from turn D-39.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, providing a concise list that directly addresses each part of the four-part question without unnecessary fluff."
