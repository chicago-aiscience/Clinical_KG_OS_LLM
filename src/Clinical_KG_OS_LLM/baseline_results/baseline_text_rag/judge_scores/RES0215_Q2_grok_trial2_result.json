  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine (OTC antihistamine) for seasonal allergies and states no prescribed medications, matching key facts in the Gold Answer and transcript (P-36, P-47). However, citations are inaccurate (refers to D-36/P-36 and D-47/P-47, attributing to doctor instead of parent), representing minor discrepancies while core facts remain accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) no medications/treatments for current episodes (resolve on own, P-33/P-34); (2) occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies (P-35/P-36); (3) no prescribed medications (P-36, P-46/P-47); (4) no antibiotics for past viral infections (P-16). Generated covers (2) and (3) partially (~50-60% coverage), misses explicit no treatment for current episodes and past infections/no antibiotics.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are verifiable in transcript: Reactine/OTC for allergies in P-36, no prescribed/regular meds in P-36/P-47/P-46; no hallucination. Minor issue with inaccurate citations (D- instead of P-), but content grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications for allergies (other condition) and no prescribed meds, aligning with question on current/other treatments and prescribed management; no irrelevant content."
