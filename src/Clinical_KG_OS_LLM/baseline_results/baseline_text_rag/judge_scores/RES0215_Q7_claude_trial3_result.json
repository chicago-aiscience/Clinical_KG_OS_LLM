  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and provides no actual information about the symptom progression. The answer cuts off mid-sentence ('developed as follows') without any content, making it factually devoid of information rather than incorrect. It contains zero facts to compare against the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: the 4-5 day timeline, the initial trigger (playing tag), the wheezing and breathing difficulty, the fluctuating episodic pattern, the emergence of cough as a later symptom, the single nocturnal episode, or any of the pertinent negatives. The answer is essentially blank.",
    "faithfulness": "While the Generated Answer doesn't contain hallucinated information, it also doesn't contain any information at all. It cannot be considered faithful to the transcript because it provides no verifiable claims. The incomplete sentence suggests an intent to answer but no actual content was generated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer begins to address the question ('the patient's respiratory symptoms developed as follows') but provides no actual answer. The question specifically asks about symptom development, changes, initial trigger, fluctuating pattern, emergence of cough, and nocturnal episode - none of which are addressed due to the incomplete response."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is incomplete and provides no substantive information. It begins with a phrase indicating intent to describe symptom progression but cuts off without any actual content. This results in zero coverage of the Gold Answer's key points including the timeline, initial trigger, symptom evolution, fluctuating pattern, cough emergence, and nocturnal episode. The response fails on all evaluation dimensions due to being essentially blank rather than containing incorrect information."
