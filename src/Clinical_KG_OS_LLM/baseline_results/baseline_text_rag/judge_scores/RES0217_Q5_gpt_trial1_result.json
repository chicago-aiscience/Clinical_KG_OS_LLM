  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s reasoning that Friday hiking plus Saturday gardening implied the tick could have been attached since those outdoor exposures, leading the doctor to state it was on for “longer than at least 72 hours” (this is explicitly in [D-6]). It also correctly states the doctor used the Ontario Lyme distribution map and judged Strathroy as “close enough to be considered…concerning,” supporting antibiotics ([D-13]). Minor issue: it cites [D-5] for the >72h inference, but [D-5] is about tick species/coloration; the >72h duration reasoning is in [D-6].",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) outdoor exposures Friday/Saturday used to estimate >72h attachment; (2) Strathroy location checked against Ontario Lyme map; (3) this supported prophylactic antibiotics. Missing/minimized details from the Gold Answer: the patient’s explicit uncertainty about when she got the tick (“I don’t really know when I got it” [P-1]), that it was removed “earlier today” ([D-1]), and the doctor’s intermediate statement about time since last outdoors to noticing it ([D-2]).",
    "faithfulness": "The content is largely grounded in the transcript and matches the stated clinician reasoning. However, there are minor citation inaccuracies: the >72h claim is not supported by [D-5], and the map justification is supported by [D-13] more than [D-12] (which is just prompting for location; the patient’s Strathroy answer is [P-12]). No major hallucinated facts beyond citation misalignment.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: how the activities led to an estimated >72h attachment and how Strathroy’s position on the Lyme map supported prophylaxis, with no meaningful tangents."
