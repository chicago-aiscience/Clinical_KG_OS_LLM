{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the prescribed medication and accurately states the circumstance for the missed dose: the daughter’s birthday celebration altered the usual dinner-time routine, leading to forgetting the dose. These match the Gold Answer without introducing errors.",
    "completeness": "It covers the main required elements from the Gold Answer (Keppra; missed dose due to daughter’s birthday/changed dinner routine). It does not include additional Gold Answer details (that Keppra is for chronic epilepsy, that the lapse was described as situational/not a pattern, and that the patient linked the missed dose to the seizure), but those are not strictly necessary to answer the question as asked.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (Keppra in P-23; birthday celebration and altered dinner timing in P-24). No hallucinated or unverifiable claims are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question (medication and specific circumstance leading to the missed dose) and contains no irrelevant content."
