  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer comprehensively describes the simultaneous onset of loss of smell, loss of taste, and dry cough two days prior, their consistent severity without fluctuation or worsening, the partial nature of sensory losses, and no prior similar symptoms, with specific citations. The Generated Answer only begins to mention loss of smell but provides no information on timing relative to other symptoms, progression, fluctuation, or prior history, making it factually incomplete and unable to match the Gold Answer's facts; thus, it is mostly incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) all three symptoms began simultaneously ~2 days before visit; (2) dry cough confirmed to start at same time; (3) sensory symptoms consistent without fluctuation; (4) dry cough consistent without worsening; (5) partial sensory losses persisted; (6) no prior similar symptoms. Generated Answer covers 0 of these key points (<20%).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer's sole claim ('the patient reports that the loss of smell') is directly verifiable in [P-1] of the transcript with no hallucination or unverifiable details; however, it lacks citations and substantive content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer starts on-topic by referencing the transcript and loss of smell but ends abruptly without addressing symptom timing relative to each other, progression/fluctuation, or prior history, making it only partially relevant with no actual answer to the question."
