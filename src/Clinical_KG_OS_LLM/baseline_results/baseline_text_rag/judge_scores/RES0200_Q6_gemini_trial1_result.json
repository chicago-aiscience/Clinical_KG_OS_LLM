  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the items it includes (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, Covid swab, X-ray, and oxygen saturation). There are no contradictions with the gold answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete as it truncates mid-sentence. It fails to list three of the four specific therapeutic interventions requested in the prompt (steroids, antibiotics, and continuation of bronchodilators) and also misses the blood pressure monitoring noted in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made are directly supported by the transcript, specifically from section [D-52]. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant and follows the requested structure, but its relevance is diminished by the abrupt ending which leaves the most critical part of the 'Therapeutic Interventions' section missing."
