  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the use of Reactine for allergies and the absence of prescribed medications, aligning perfectly with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses key points from the Gold Answer, specifically that no treatment is given for the current respiratory episodes (they resolve with rest) and that no antibiotics were used for past infections. It covers approximately 50% of the relevant points.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is entirely grounded in the transcript. Although the citations refer to the doctor's turns (D-36, D-47), the information correctly reflects the exchange regarding medications.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but fails to answer the part regarding treatments for the 'current respiratory episodes,' focusing only on the general medications and prescribed status."
