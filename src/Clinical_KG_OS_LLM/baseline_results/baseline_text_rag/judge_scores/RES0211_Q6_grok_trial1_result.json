  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately recaps the doctor's summary from D-58, listing the key findings (3-4 day dry cough, fever, headache, no sputum, no asthma, no recent sick contacts except brother 2 weeks ago) which match the Gold Answer's 5 points with only minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'a little bit of fever, some headache' vs. 'a little bit of fever, a headache'); Jessica's primary goal from P-60 is correctly stated, aligning with Gold's core facts, though Gold includes additional interpretive framing and P-61 which are not contradicted.",
    "completeness": "Covers all 5 key clinical findings from Gold (dry cough duration, fever/headache, no sputum, sick contacts with brother exception, no asthma, Claritin noted implicitly via 'no medications aside'); fully covers Jessica's primary goal from P-60; misses Gold's details on doctor's framing of visit purpose/checking and P-61 (desire to go home/lay down), covering ~85-90% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in D-58 (exact recap of symptoms, history) and P-60 (Jessica's goal); citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by focusing solely on doctor's recapped findings from D-58 and Jessica's primary goal from P-60, with no off-topic content."
