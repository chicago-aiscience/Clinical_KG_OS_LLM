  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the clinician suspects recurrent asthma as the top differential and that cardiac ischemia is considered less likely—both are supported by D-35 and D-36. No incorrect or contradictory statements are present in what is provided, though the answer is cut off mid-sentence.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) assessment: asthma recurrence top of differential pending exam; (2) planned physical exam: quick exam with lung auscultation and consider further investigations; (3) first-step treatment: therapeutic trial of obtaining/using a rescue inhaler on walks; (4) contingency: if no improvement, reassess/“come back to the table,” stepwise approach, consider other directions/investigations; (5) clinician will talk to supervising doctor. Generated Answer covers only (1) and partially mentions lower likelihood of cardiac ischemia; it omits (2)-(5).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are grounded in the transcript (D-35, D-36). No hallucinated exam components, treatments, or follow-up plans are added. The response is incomplete but what is stated is verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic (addresses the clinician’s assessment) but does not answer most of the asked elements (physical exam plan, initial intervention, contingency plan)."
