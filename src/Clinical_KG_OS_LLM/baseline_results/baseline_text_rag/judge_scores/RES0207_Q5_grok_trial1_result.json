  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key facts from the Gold Answer and transcript: missing Keppra dose due to birthday routine change [P-24], epilepsy diagnosis [P-8/P-9], and family history of epilepsy in mother [P-26]. No factual errors or contradictions; minor citation shift (P-9 for diagnosis, actually P-8) but core facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: medication non-adherence (missed Keppra, reason [P-24]); hereditary risk (family history, mom had epilepsy [P-26]); relation to diagnosis. Missed: explicit genetic predisposition link, patient's acknowledgment that missing med precipitated seizure [P-9], infrequency of seizures when adherent [P-9], and combination explanation. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: Keppra [P-23], miss due to birthday [P-24], epilepsy [P-8/P-9], family history/mom [P-26]. Citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses hereditary (family history) and medication (missed dose) risks for seizure, and links family history to epilepsy diagnosis; perfectly focused with no off-topic content."
