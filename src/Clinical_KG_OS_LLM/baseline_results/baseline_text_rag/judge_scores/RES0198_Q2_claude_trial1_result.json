  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core facts correctly: decongestants were tried, patient felt they worked 'a little bit', and doctor recommended Tylenol cold. However, it lacks precision in describing the patient's assessment (the specific reasoning about nose transitioning from stuffy to runny) and omits supportive care measures like hydration that were part of the doctor's recommendation. The facts stated are accurate but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of the Gold Answer's key points. It correctly identifies: (1) decongestants tried, (2) 'worked a little bit' assessment, and (3) Tylenol Cold recommendation. However, it omits several key elements from the Gold Answer: the patient's specific reasoning about why they thought it worked (stuffy to runny transition), the broader recommendation to stay well hydrated, the general supportive care approach, and the doctor's explanation about viral illness taking weeks to resolve with limited treatment options beyond supportive care.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The decongestant use is mentioned in P-10, the 'worked a little bit' assessment is a direct quote from P-10, and the Tylenol cold recommendation appears in D-39. The citations provided (P-10, D-39) are accurate. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: (1) what medication was tried (decongestants), (2) the patient's assessment (worked a little bit), and (3) doctor's OTC recommendation (Tylenol cold). The response is focused and contains no irrelevant information, though it could be more detailed."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and highly relevant, correctly identifying the key medications and assessments mentioned in the transcript. However, it provides a condensed version that omits important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including the patient's reasoning about symptom transition, hydration recommendations, and the doctor's explanation about viral illness duration and treatment limitations. All stated facts are verifiable in the source transcript with no hallucinations."
