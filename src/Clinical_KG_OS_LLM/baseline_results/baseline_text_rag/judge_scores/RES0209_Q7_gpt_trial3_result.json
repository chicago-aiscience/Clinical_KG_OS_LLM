  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer states the patient was diagnosed with asthma at age 8 and previously used the bronchodilator about once every two weeks—both are consistent with the transcript (diagnosis from P-2; baseline use from P-8). It also mentions an “almost nonstop” cough over the past week and shortness of breath, which are supported (P-1). However, it does not reflect the clarified two-week duration (P-13) and is cut off mid-sentence, so it does not correctly describe the full current bronchodilator escalation (5–6 times/week) that the question explicitly asks about.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) diagnosis at age 8; (2) baseline bronchodilator use once every ~2 weeks; (3) current prominent cough and shortness of breath. Key points missed: age now 10 and two-year history; clarified two-week exacerbation; dramatic escalation to near-daily bronchodilator use 5–6 times/week; increased wheeze and that wheezing occurs more often than bronchodilator use (uses only when very hard to breathe); chest tightness; nighttime symptoms frequency; baseline triggers (exercise/cold) and seasonal pattern; denial of infectious symptoms/exposures. Overall coverage is well under half of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The statements included are grounded in the transcript, but citation references are inaccurate (e.g., diagnosis attributed to D-2/D-3 rather than P-2). The duration described as “past week” is supported by the initial patient statement (P-1) though it omits the later clarification to two weeks (P-13). No clear hallucinated facts beyond citation issues.",
    "relevance": "What is provided is on-topic (asthma symptom course and bronchodilator use), but the answer is incomplete/truncated and fails to address the core part of the question: the evolution to current near-daily bronchodilator use (5–6 times/week) and associated symptom evolution."

  "summary": "The response is generally accurate and transcript-grounded for the limited points it mentions, but it is truncated and omits most key details—especially the current near-daily bronchodilator use and full exacerbation timeline—making it incomplete and only partially responsive."
