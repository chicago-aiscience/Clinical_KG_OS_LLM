  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the two proposed procedures (chest X-ray from D-37 and COVID swab from D-39) and the exact rationale for the COVID swab (clinic protocol for anyone with these symptoms from D-39), fully consistent with Gold Answer's core facts; no errors or contradictions, though it omits elaborative details like swab discomfort or X-ray explanation.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: no meds/history (mentioned but question-given), procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab with citations and quotes), swab rationale (institutional protocol quote), additional details (discomfort, reassurance, plan). Generated covers procedures and exact swab rationale (core to question); misses history confirmation, X-ray explanation, discomfort/reassurance/plan (about 80-90% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: chest X-ray proposed in D-37 ('might want to do a chest X Ray'), COVID swab in D-39 ('do a covid swab'), rationale verbatim from D-39 ('we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately'); accurate citations, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists proposed procedures and specific rationale for COVID swab, perfectly matching the question with no off-topic content."
