{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the activities (hiking and gardening) and the resulting time estimate (>72 hours). It also correctly identifies the use of the Lyme disease distribution map to justify treatment based on the Strathroy location. No factual errors were found.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses the specific detail from the transcript/Gold Answer that the tick was removed 'earlier today' [D-1]. This detail is crucial because it serves as the temporal endpoint for the doctor's calculation of the 72-hour duration starting from Friday/Saturday. It also omits the specific detail that the hiking was 'along the creek' [P-12].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript. However, it cites [D-5] for the 72-hour duration claim, but [D-5] actually discusses deer tick identification and Lyme disease background. The duration logic is specifically found in [D-6].",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question regarding the attachment duration and the geographic justification for treatment."
