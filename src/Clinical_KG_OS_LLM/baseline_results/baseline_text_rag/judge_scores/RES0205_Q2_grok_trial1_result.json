  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient is not currently taking any prescribed medications (P-23), previously took medication for anxiety 2-3 years ago but stopped (P-24), and manages acid reflux with dietary avoidance of acidic foods and chocolates (P-25). These facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript, with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) no current prescribed meds (P-23); (2) past anxiety meds stopped 2-3 yrs ago (P-24); (3) acid reflux managed by diet, no meds (P-22, P-25); (4) hay fever no treatment mentioned (P-27); (5) cough no meds prescribed yet (P-35, D-37); (6) zero meds across all conditions. Generated covers (1), (2), (3) fully (~60% coverage), misses (4), (5), (6).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (P-23, P-24, P-25); no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by detailing current medication status (none) and acid reflux management (diet), with all content focused on the query; no irrelevant or off-topic information."
