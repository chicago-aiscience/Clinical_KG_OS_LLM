  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and correctly states that testing was negative, consistent with the patient’s statement: “I have had the covid test and I don't have it” (P-35). It also correctly notes the patient is a hospital worker and that coworkers are concerned when the patient coughs (P-34, P-35). The main issue is not factual contradiction but imprecise support/citation: it cites “D-35” for facts that occur in the patient’s speech (P-35) and cites the wrong line for hospital employment (should be P-34/P-17).",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are covered: (1) COVID-19 was investigated, (2) hospital worker status as a reason to consider testing, (3) workplace concern about coughing, (4) negative COVID test.\nKey points missed: the broader symptom evidence (initial flu-like symptoms: sore throat/runny nose), the persistent nature of cough as part of concern, PPE/being careful at work, the timing of testing (at symptom onset ~2 weeks ago), and that the patient stayed home awaiting symptom resolution before returning to work.",
    "faithfulness": "The core claims (COVID investigated; negative test; coworkers scared when coughing; works at hospital) are all supported by the transcript. However, the answer repeatedly mis-cites the transcript (using D-35 instead of P-35, and D-35 for hospital worker status), which reduces faithfulness per the rubric’s emphasis on accurate grounding/citation. No major hallucinated clinical facts are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays directly focused on what was asked: the diagnosis investigated, what prompted it, and what testing showed. No material tangents."
