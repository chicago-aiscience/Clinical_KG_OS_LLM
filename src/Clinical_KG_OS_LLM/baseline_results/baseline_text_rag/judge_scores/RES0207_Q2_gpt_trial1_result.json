  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the medication as Keppra and accurately describes the specific reason for the missed dose: the daughter’s birthday celebration changed the usual dinner routine, which is when the patient typically takes the medication. This matches the Gold Answer and transcript (P-23, P-24).",
    "completeness": "For the question asked (current chronic-condition medication + specific circumstance causing missed dose), the Generated Answer includes all required key points: Keppra and the altered dinner routine due to the daughter’s birthday celebration leading to forgetting the dose. It omits extra contextual details from the Gold Answer (e.g., linkage to seizure, clinician framing as isolated lapse), but those are not necessary to answer the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (P-23 for Keppra; P-24 for the birthday/changed dinner timing leading to forgetting). No hallucinated or unsupported claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the two elements asked (medication and circumstance for the missed dose) with no tangential information."
