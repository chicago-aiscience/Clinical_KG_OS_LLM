  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately restates the doctor's stated plan from D-47 ('go review your story with the doctors'), matching the Gold Answer. The summary assessment correctly paraphrases key elements from D-47 (cough for a while, bad in last three days, wakes at night, bringing up sputum), with no factual errors or contradictions. However, it truncates mid-sentence, omitting details like 'greenish sputum, no blood' and 'no constitutional symptoms,' leading to minor discrepancies in full factual alignment with the detailed Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: Stated plan to review story with doctors (100%). Partial summary assessment (cough duration/worsening ~50%, nighttime awakening, sputum production start). Missed: Full assessment details (greenish sputum, no blood, no constitutional symptoms and implications for serious illness), patient addition (P-47), doctor response (D-48), no tests/treatments ordered, trainee context, and explicit guidance for next steps (supervising physician's review of history). Covers approximately 30-40% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in D-47: plan verbatim; assessment paraphrase matches 'you've had this cough... for a little while but it's only become bad in the last three days. You're waking up at night and you're kind of bringing up this... greenish sputum'. Accurate citation to D-47. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly structured to address question parts with bullets for 'Stated Plan' and 'Summary Assessment'; remains focused on transcript content without tangents. Incomplete coverage of assessment and omission of next steps guidance (third question part) prevents perfect score, but mostly relevant."
