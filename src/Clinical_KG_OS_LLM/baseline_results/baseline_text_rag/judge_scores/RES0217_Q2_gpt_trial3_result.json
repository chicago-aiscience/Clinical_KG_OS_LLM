  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient is on a statin (though the patient could not name it) and that the clinician discussed starting prophylactic antibiotics due to likely prolonged tick attachment. It also correctly notes discussion of sending the tick for lab identification and ordering bloodwork/serology. Minor issue: it cites [D-15] for the statin, but the statin is stated by the patient at [P-15], while [D-15] is the doctor’s question.",
    "completeness": "Covers: current statin therapy; proposed prophylactic antibiotics; tick sent for identification; bloodwork/serology. Misses key Gold Answer elements: prior tick bite treated with antibiotics ~10 years ago; denial of allergies/no drug allergies; plan to consult supervising physician before finalizing; environmental prevention advice (insecticide/yard measures); note that no specific antibiotic/dose/duration was provided.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript. The main faithfulness problem is the incorrect citation for statin therapy ([D-15] instead of [P-15]). No major hallucinated treatments or medications are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications and treatments discussed (statin and prophylactic measures for tick bite). It is relevant but incomplete regarding all treatments/medication-related counseling mentioned in the visit."

  "summary": "The answer is mostly accurate and relevant, capturing the statin and proposed prophylactic antibiotics plus lab/serology plans, but it omits several Gold Answer elements (allergies, prior antibiotics, supervising-physician consult, insecticide advice) and has a minor citation error."
