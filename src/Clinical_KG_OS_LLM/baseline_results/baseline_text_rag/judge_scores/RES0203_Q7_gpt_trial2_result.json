  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains only an unfinished fragment (“the patient reports that the loss of smell,”) and does not provide any timeline, relative onset, progression, fluctuation, or prior-history details. The only implied claim—that the patient reported loss of smell—is consistent with the transcript, but the clinically relevant assertions in the Gold Answer (simultaneous onset of smell/taste loss and cough ~2 days prior, consistency/no worsening, partial anosmia/ageusia, no prior similar episodes) are not addressed.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed: (1) all three symptoms began at the same time ~2 days prior; (2) cough started at same time as sensory loss; (3) symptoms were consistent without fluctuation; (4) cough did not worsen; (5) partial smell/taste loss details; (6) no prior similar symptoms. Generated Answer covers essentially none of these (only a fragment referencing loss of smell).",
    "faithfulness": "No hallucinated or contradictory details are introduced. The only content present is consistent with the transcript, though it is too incomplete to substantively verify more.",
    "relevance": "The fragment is on-topic (symptoms) but does not answer the question about symptom development over time, relative onset, progression, or prior history."
