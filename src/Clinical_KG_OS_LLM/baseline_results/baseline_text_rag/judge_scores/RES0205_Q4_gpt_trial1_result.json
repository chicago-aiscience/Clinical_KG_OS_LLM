  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition, based on the patient’s statement that they had a COVID test and “I don't have it” (P-35). It correctly states the test was done at symptom onset about two weeks prior (P-36). The workplace concern that coworkers are scared when the patient coughs and the desire to return to work without coughing are also accurate (P-35, P-36). No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Included: (1) condition ruled out = COVID-19; (2) test = COVID test; (3) timing = at onset ~2 weeks ago; (4) one key workplace concern = coworkers scared + wants to return without coughing.\nMissing vs Gold Answer: (a) explicit workplace context that the patient works at a hospital as a clerk (P-34); (b) mention of PPE/heightened infection-control context (P-17); (c) that they have been staying home since the test while awaiting improvement (P-36); (d) the broader implication of hospital setting/infectious-risk concern emphasized in the Gold Answer. Overall, it captures some but not all workplace-related concerns.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements made in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (COVID test and negative result: P-35; timing at onset ~2 weeks: P-36; coworkers scared: P-35; return to work without coughing: P-36). No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the question elements (ruled-out condition, test, timing, workplace concerns). However, it incompletely addresses the workplace-related concerns by omitting the hospital-clerk role/PPE and related infection-control context, so it is not fully responsive to that part."
