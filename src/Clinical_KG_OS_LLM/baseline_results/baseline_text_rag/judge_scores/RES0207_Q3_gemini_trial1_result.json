  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medication (Keppra), the reason for the missed dose (disrupted dinner routine/daughter's birthday), and accurately quotes the patient's recognition of the causal link.",
    "completeness": "While the generated answer covers the basic facts, it misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it doesn't mention that the patient's recognition was voluntary and unprompted by questions about medication adherence, it omits the patient's mention of infrequent seizures as supporting evidence for a specific trigger, and it doesn't clarify that no clinician confirmation is present in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript. The use of bracketed text '[caused it]' accurately interprets the patient's trailing sentence 'I think that might have yeah' in turn P-9.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question without any irrelevant information."
