  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the medication non-adherence (missing Keppra due to daughter's birthday, citing P-24) and hereditary factor (epilepsy in family, specifically mother, citing P-26), matching the Gold Answer's facts. It correctly notes the epilepsy diagnosis (citing P-9, close to P-8 in transcript). Patient's attribution of seizure to missed med (P-9) is implied but not contradicted. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) Hereditary (family epilepsy, mom had it [P-26]); 2) Genetic predisposition consistent with patient's epilepsy [P-8]; 3) Medication miss (Keppra [P-23], reason [P-24]); 4) Patient links miss to seizure [P-9]; 5) Infrequent seizures normally [P-9]; 6) Combination of factors. Generated covers medication miss with reason, epilepsy diagnosis, family history with mom. Misses explicit genetic predisposition link, infrequency, direct patient attribution quote/context, clinician question [D-26], and combination emphasis. Covers ~80% of core points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: Keppra miss and reason directly from P-24; epilepsy from P-8/P-9; family history verbatim from P-26. Citations accurate (P-9 for diagnosis is adjacent to P-8). No unverifiable or hallucinated details; fully verifiable in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses hereditary (family/mom) and medication (Keppra miss) risks for seizure, and family history relation to epilepsy diagnosis. Concise, no tangents or off-topic content."
