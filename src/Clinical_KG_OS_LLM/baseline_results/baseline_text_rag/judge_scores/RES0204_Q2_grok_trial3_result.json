{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the two diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray from D-37 and COVID swab from D-39) proposed by the doctor, matching the Gold Answer. The rationale for the COVID swab is precisely restated as the clinic's practice for anyone with these symptoms (D-39), consistent with the Gold's description of institutional protocol. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: no medications/history (premise, not restated); two procedures (chest X-ray [D-37] and COVID swab [D-39]); X-ray explanation; swab rationale (institutional protocol [D-39]); discomfort/reassurance; plan to arrange/discuss [D-40]; no treatments. Generated covers both procedures with citations and full specific rationale for swab (100% of core question elements), but misses X-ray rationale details, discomfort note, reassurance, and plan (covers ~80-90% of Gold's details).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: chest X-ray proposed in D-37 ('might want to do a chest X Ray'); COVID swab in D-39 ('do a covid swab'); rationale verbatim paraphrase from D-39 ('we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately'). Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly lists the proposed procedures and provides the exact requested rationale for the COVID swab, perfectly matching the question without any off-topic content."
