  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All statements in the Generated Answer match the Gold Answer and transcript: the patient is not currently taking prescribed medications (P-23), previously took an anxiety medication 2–3 years ago and stopped (P-24), and is managing reflux with dietary avoidance (P-25). No contradictory or incorrect claims are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: (1) no current prescribed meds, (2) past anxiety medication stopped 2–3 years ago, (3) reflux managed via avoiding trigger foods. Missed key points from Gold Answer: (1) hay fever noted but no treatment described, (2) cough condition/treatment status—patient requesting medication but none prescribed/recommended yet, (3) clinician plan to examine/consult before next steps, (4) explicit cross-condition summary that the patient is on zero medications across anxiety, reflux, hay fever, and cough.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript excerpts cited (P-23, P-24, P-25). No hallucinated treatments, prescriptions, or additional conditions are added.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses current medication status and what they are doing for reflux, and whether they are taking prescribed medications. However, it does not fully address 'across all conditions' because it omits the cough and hay fever treatment/medication status."
