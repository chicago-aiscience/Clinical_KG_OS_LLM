  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The information provided in the generated answer regarding the hiking on Friday, gardening on Saturday, and the location of the tick is entirely accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer. The comparison of engorgement is also correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. It misses several key points from the gold answer: the doctor's 72-hour attachment estimate, the specific details of the prior episode (antibiotic treatment and bullseye rash), and the full comparison of symptoms (the response cuts off mid-sentence under the 'Symptoms' bullet point).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made are directly supported by the transcript. There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question asked; however, its utility is limited by the fact that it stops abruptly mid-sentence, failing to address the symptom comparison requested."
