  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All statements match the Gold Answer and the transcript: the doctor wanted to rule out COVID-19, ordered a swab, expected results in 24–48 hours, and if negative considered another viral illness circulating that time of year. No contradictory or incorrect details are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Includes all elements requested in the question and all corresponding key points in the Gold Answer relevant to that question: (1) condition to rule out (COVID-19), (2) test (swab), (3) turnaround time (24–48 hours), and (4) alternative diagnosis if negative (another viral illness). It omits isolation/contact tracing/supportive care, but those are not required by the question prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by D-52 in the transcript; no hallucinated or unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers each part of the question with no tangential material."
