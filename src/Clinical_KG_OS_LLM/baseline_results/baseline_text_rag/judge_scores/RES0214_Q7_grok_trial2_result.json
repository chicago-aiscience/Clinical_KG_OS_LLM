  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer provides no factual content beyond an introductory phrase, offering zero information on symptom progression or timelines, thus containing no facts to compare for accuracy against the Gold Answer, which details specific sequence (stuffy nose first, sore throat, fever for 3 days, muscle aches concurrent) and husband's earlier onset; equivalent to fully incorrect as it fails to convey any correct facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: 1) stuffy nose first ('just before' fever); 2) sore throat around fever onset, ongoing; 3) fever for 3 days; 4) muscle aches past 2-3 days concurrent with fever; 5) husband symptoms for past week (~4 days before patient's fever). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, missing all.",
    "faithfulness": "The only claim is 'Based on the transcript excerpts,' which is verifiable as the evaluation context references a transcript; however, it stops abruptly with no further content or citations, resulting in no substantive claims grounded in the transcript and effectively no verifiable medical details from it.",
    "relevance": "The introductory phrase directly signals intent to address the question on symptom progression from the transcript, but provides no actual description, timeline, or comparison, making it minimally relevant as it sets up but does not deliver on the query."
