  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main elements of the plan from [D-43], including physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab, consultation with attending, and decision criteria based on labs and vital signs, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancies include phrasing the COVID swab as 'to rule out infection' (transcript specifies 'rule out covid'), omitting the preliminary clinical impression of COPD exacerbation triggered by infection, not explicitly listing 'labs' as a separate test (though mentioned in criteria), and minor rephrasing of 'admit to the ER' vs. transcript's 'stay in the ER and be admitted'. No major errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam/vitals/chest auscultation (full), COVID swab (full), consultation with attending (full), disposition criteria based on labs/vitals (full). Partially covers diagnostic testing by omitting explicit mention of broader 'labs/bloodwork' as a test (only in criteria), misses preliminary clinical impression entirely, and omits patient agreement and temperature reference. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer directly verifiable in [D-43]: physical exam/vitals/chest listen ('physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest'), COVID swab ('covid swab'), labs/vitals in criteria ('labs in your vital signs'), attending consult ('talk to my attending'), disposition decision ('stay in the ER and be admitted, or... good to go home'). Citations accurate; 'rule out infection' is plausible from context but specifically 'covid' in transcript—no hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured perfectly around the question's elements (examinations, tests, consultations, decision criteria), with no irrelevant content or tangents, directly addressing the comprehensive plan at the end of the consultation."
