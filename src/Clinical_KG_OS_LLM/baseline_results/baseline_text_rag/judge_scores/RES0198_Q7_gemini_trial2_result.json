{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the duration (one week), the initial symptom (stuffy nose), and the progression to a runny nose. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating that information regarding whether symptoms were constant or intermittent was not found and that the patient did not answer the question. In the transcript [P-8], the patient explicitly states it has been 'pretty constant for the past week.'",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the onset, the first symptom, and the change in symptoms. It fails to mention the patient's use of OTC decongestants as a factor in the symptom progression (mentioned in the Gold Answer and [P-10]). Crucially, it fails to provide the specific answer regarding the constancy of symptoms, which was a specific requirement of the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer makes a false claim that the information about the symptoms being constant or intermittent was missing from the transcript. This is a negative hallucination, as the answer is clearly provided in [P-8].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant as it attempts to address every component of the prompt (onset, first symptom, change, and constancy), even though it fails to correctly retrieve the information for the last part."
