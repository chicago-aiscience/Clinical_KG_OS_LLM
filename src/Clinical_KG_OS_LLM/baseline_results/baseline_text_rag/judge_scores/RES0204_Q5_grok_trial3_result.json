  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately reports the doctor's inquiry at D-28 and the disclosure of grandparents' asthma at P-28, as well as the differentiation via prior workup and absence of shortness of breath/wheezing during activity from P-28, matching Gold; minor discrepancy in attributing response to 'patient' instead of mother (contextually mom speaking), but core facts consistent with Gold and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: doctor's inquiry about family respiratory history (D-28), grandparents' asthma (P-28), differentiation via prior asthma workup and no SOB/wheezing even with activity (P-28). Missed: doctor's acknowledgment of question difficulty/inviting mom help (D-28), clinical relevance to dry cough, doctor's summary 'some asthma in family' (D-30), details on current dry non-productive cough (D-5/P-5 etc.), clear runny nose (D-11/P-11 etc.), absence of wheeze/SOB in current presentation explicitly, prior shorter respiratory issues without dry cough (P-24), conclusion of distinct acute event. Covers ~50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (D-28, P-28); no hallucinated facts, fully grounded despite minor contextual ambiguity on speaker in P-28 (labeled P but mom speaking).",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses doctor's inquiry linking to family respiratory history (asthma), and differentiation using symptom profile evidence (prior workup, no SOB/wheezing); somewhat shallow on full symptom profile and explicit connection to presenting cough, but no irrelevant content."
