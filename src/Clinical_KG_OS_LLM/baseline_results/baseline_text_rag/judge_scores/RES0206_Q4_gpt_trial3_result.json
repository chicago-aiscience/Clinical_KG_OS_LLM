{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out (doctor explicitly states this at D-43), correctly names the ordered test as a COVID swab (D-43), and accurately describes the relevant exposure history (walking dogs with friends, one friend was sick, and they sometimes walked too close at P-20). No statements contradict the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "For the specific question asked (condition to rule out, test ordered, and the social-contact detail prompting concern), the Generated Answer includes all key elements: COVID-19, COVID swab, and exposure to a sick friend during outdoor dog walks with occasional close proximity. It omits additional context from the Gold Answer (e.g., uncertainty about whether the friend was tested, other COVID screening questions), but those details are not required to answer the question as posed.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (D-43, P-20). No hallucinated or unverifiable details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what the question asks: diagnosis to rule out, test, and exposure detail. No tangential information."
