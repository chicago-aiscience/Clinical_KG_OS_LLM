  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the respiratory inhalers (Ventolin/Ventilin and Spiriva), Ventolin usage (almost 10 times in past week), and the discontinued diuretic without doctor's approval. All facts match the Gold Answer and transcript with no contradictions or errors, though spelling 'Ventilin' reflects transcript variation.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: respiratory inhalers (Ventolin, Spiriva) covered; Ventolin frequency (~10 times/week) covered; non-respiratory current drug (atorvastatin/'Torva Staten') missed; discontinued medication (diuretic for BP, stopped without approval) covered. Covers ~75-80% of key points (3 out of 4 main elements).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript (inhalers in [P-11], Ventolin use in [P-12], diuretic discontinuation in [P-35, P-36]). No hallucinations. Citations reference the preceding doctor prompts ([D-11, D-12, D-35, D-36]) rather than patient responses, making them slightly inaccurate but claims fully verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists the requested current medications (focusing on respiratory, omits one non-resp but still addresses), Ventolin frequency, and discontinued medication with no off-topic content."
