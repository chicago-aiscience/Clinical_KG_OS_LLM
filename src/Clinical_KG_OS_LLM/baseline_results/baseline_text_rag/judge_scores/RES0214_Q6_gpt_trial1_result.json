{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All elements stated in the Generated Answer align with the Gold Answer and the transcript: COVID swab ordered (D-53), self-isolation for patient and husband (D-53) with reinforcement to keep to themselves (D-54), and plan to proceed to a physical exam (D-52). The added phrase about further investigation/workup is consistent with D-53 and does not introduce contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) COVID swab ordered, (2) self-isolation for both patient and husband and rationale/precaution, (3) plan for physical exam. Key point missed vs Gold: the clinician’s stated next step before concluding the encounter was also to go talk to the (supervising) doctor and return (D-55). Minor omission: patient agreement to the plan (P-54). Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript excerpts cited (D-52, D-53, D-54). No clear hallucinations. The mention of “investigate/work up further” is directly supported by the wording in D-53.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on exactly what was asked (test ordered, precautions for patient/husband, next steps). The only shortcoming is omission of the final stated step of consulting the doctor and returning, which affects completeness more than relevance."
