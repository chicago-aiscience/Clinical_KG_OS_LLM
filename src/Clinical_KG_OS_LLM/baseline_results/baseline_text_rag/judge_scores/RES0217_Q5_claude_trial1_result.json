  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key temporal reasoning (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday leading to >72 hour attachment) and the geographic justification (Strathroy on distribution map). However, it contains a citation error - [D-5] does not contain information about the 72-hour calculation; this appears in [D-6]. The core facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer captures the main points but lacks important supporting details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the patient's uncertainty about when the tick attached ('I don't really know when I got it'), (2) the discovery timeline ('earlier today'), (3) the specific location detail ('along the creek'), (4) the doctor's exact phrasing about Strathroy being 'close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point', and (5) the explicit connection between both factors leading to the antibiotic decision. Covers approximately 60% of key details.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is largely grounded in the transcript with one citation error. The claim about D-5 containing 72-hour information is inaccurate - D-5 discusses tick species identification, not attachment duration. The correct citation should be D-6. All other claims are verifiable in the transcript, though the citations could be more precise (e.g., [D-12, D-13] is correct but [P-12] should also be included for the Strathroy location).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) how the activities contributed to estimated >72-hour attachment, and (2) how Strathroy's position on the distribution map justified prophylactic treatment. The response is focused and contains no irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core reasoning for both attachment duration and geographic risk factors, directly addressing the question. However, it lacks the supporting details and specific quotes that make the Gold Answer more comprehensive. A citation error (referencing D-5 instead of D-6 for the 72-hour calculation) and missing contextual details reduce completeness and faithfulness scores slightly. The response remains highly relevant and factually accurate in its main claims."
