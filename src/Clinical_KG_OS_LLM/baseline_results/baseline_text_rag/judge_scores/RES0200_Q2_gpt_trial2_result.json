  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the two respiratory inhalers (Ventolin and Spiriva) and correctly reports Ventolin use as ~10 times in the past week (from P-12). It also correctly identifies that the patient stopped a previously prescribed diuretic blood pressure medication without physician approval (P-36). No statements contradict the Gold Answer. However, it omits atorvastatin, which is a key non-respiratory medication the patient was taking prior to the visit.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) Ventolin, (2) Spiriva, (3) Ventolin use ~10 times in past week, (4) self-discontinuation of diuretic BP med. Missed: the non-respiratory medication atorvastatin (“Torva Staten”) that the patient was actively taking for high cholesterol, which the question explicitly asks for (both respiratory and non-respiratory drugs).",
    "faithfulness": "All included clinical claims are supported by the transcript (Ventolin/Spiriva in P-11; Ventolin frequency in P-12; diuretic discontinuation in P-36). The citations provided in the generated answer are off (it cites D-11/D-12 where the patient’s actual medication names and usage are stated in P-11/P-12), but the content itself is grounded and not hallucinated.",
    "relevance": "The answer is directly aimed at the question (baseline meds, Ventolin frequency, and which med was stopped). It is missing one requested element (the non-respiratory medication atorvastatin), but otherwise stays on-topic without tangents."
