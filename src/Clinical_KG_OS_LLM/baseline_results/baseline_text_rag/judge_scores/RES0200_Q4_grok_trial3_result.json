  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID (abbreviated as 'Covid') as the alternative diagnosis to exclude due to symptom overlap, matching the Gold Answer's reference to COVID-19 and symptom overlap with COPD exacerbation (implied in context). It correctly states the diagnostic test as a 'covid swab' from [D-52] and the turnaround time as '24 to 48 hours' from [D-52], consistent with the Gold Answer. Minor issues like capitalization and citation inclusion of D-53 (which is non-substantive) do not affect core factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) alternative diagnosis = COVID-19 (covered as 'Covid'); (2) due to symptom overlap with COPD exacerbation (covered as 'symptom overlap', contextually complete); (3) test = COVID swab [D-52] (fully covered); (4) turnaround = 24-48 hours [D-52] (fully covered). No key points missed; extra details in Gold like specific symptoms are not required for completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] of transcript: 'symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid', 'covid swab', 'hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours'. Citation to D-52 is accurate; D-53 adds nothing substantive but no hallucination present. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time) with no off-topic content, perfectly focused on the query."
