  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states that the information is not found in the excerpts. This is factually incorrect because the transcript clearly documents OTC attempts for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and a routine supplement (multivitamin), along with stated lack of effectiveness for the pain-relief attempts.",
    "completeness": "Misses all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) Tylenol tried, (2) Advil tried, (3) Alka-Seltzer tried, (4) all were not very effective, (5) daily multivitamin as only routine supplement/medication, (6) no prescription meds. Provides none of these details.",
    "faithfulness": "Does not introduce fabricated medications or supplements, but the assertion that the information is not present contradicts the transcript content (i.e., it is a false 'not found' claim).",
    "relevance": "It nominally responds to the question but fails to provide the requested medications/supplements and effectiveness, so it does not meaningfully address the query."
