  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s recap of: 3–4 days of dry cough, a little bit of fever, headache, no sputum production, no asthma, and no sick contacts except the brother with a cold two weeks prior (all consistent with D-58). It also correctly states Jessica’s main goal as wanting to know if she needs medicine (P-60). However, it omits one recap item from the Gold Answer: that she is not taking any medications aside from Claritin (explicitly stated in D-58).",
    "completeness": "Covers most key recap findings (duration, dry cough, fever, headache, no sputum, sick contact exception, no asthma) and Jessica’s main goal (whether she needs medicine). Misses: (1) the doctor’s recap that she’s not taking meds aside from Claritin, (2) the doctor’s framing/confirmation that the purpose was “next steps and where to go from here,” and (3) Jessica’s additional stated desire to go home and lie down (P-61) mentioned in the Gold Answer as an immediate priority.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are supported by the transcript (D-58 and P-60). No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (doctor’s recap findings and Jessica’s stated goal for next steps) without irrelevant tangents."
