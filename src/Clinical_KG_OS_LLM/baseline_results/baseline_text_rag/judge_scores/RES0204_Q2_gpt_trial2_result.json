  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two proposed diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray [D-37] and COVID swab [D-39]) and accurately states the rationale for the COVID swab as being performed on anyone presenting with these symptoms lately (institutional/clinic practice) [D-39]. No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the key items needed to answer the question: (1) chest X-ray and (2) COVID swab, plus (3) the specific rationale for the swab (routine testing for anyone with these symptoms). It omits additional contextual details included in the Gold Answer (e.g., chest X-ray ‘to get a better look’, explanation of X-ray as an inside picture, discomfort/reassurance, arranging tests and returning with supervising doctor), but these are not strictly required to answer the prompt as asked.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript (D-37, D-39). No hallucinated procedures, rationale, or clinical details.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested diagnostic procedures and the stated rationale for the COVID swab. No irrelevant content."
