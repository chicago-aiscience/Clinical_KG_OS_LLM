  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is truncated and does not actually state any timeline details (simultaneous onset, 2-day duration, consistency/no worsening, partial nature of anosmia/ageusia, or no prior episodes). Because it contains essentially no substantive clinical claims beyond an unfinished clause (“patient reports…loss of smell”), it does not directly contradict the Gold Answer, but it also fails to provide the correct information requested.",
    "completeness": "Misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) all three symptoms started ~2 days before visit, (2) cough started at the same time as taste/smell changes, (3) symptoms were consistent without fluctuation, (4) cough did not worsen, (5) sensory loss was partial (strong odors/very salty tastes still perceived), and (6) no prior similar episodes. Coverage is <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "No hallucinated details are introduced. The only fragment (“patient reports…loss of smell”) is supported by the transcript. However, because the response is incomplete, it provides almost no verifiable content beyond that fragment.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for symptom development over time, relative onset, progression/fluctuation, and prior history. The generated answer does not address these components and is effectively non-responsive aside from an opening fragment."
