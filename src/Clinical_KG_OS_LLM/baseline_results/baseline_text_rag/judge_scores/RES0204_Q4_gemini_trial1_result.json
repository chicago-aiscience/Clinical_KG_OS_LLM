  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the respiratory condition and accurately lists the clinical findings (lack of shortness of breath and wheezing during physical activity) used to rule it out, matching the core facts in the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary components of the question (condition and symptoms). However, it omits the specific mention of the grandparents' history (which was part of the condition's identification context) and the patient's additional statement about being 'healthy otherwise' and not having had a dry cough before (P-24), which the Gold Answer includes to provide a complete picture.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript, specifically from turn [P-28]. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and concise, directly addressing both parts of the question without any extraneous information."
