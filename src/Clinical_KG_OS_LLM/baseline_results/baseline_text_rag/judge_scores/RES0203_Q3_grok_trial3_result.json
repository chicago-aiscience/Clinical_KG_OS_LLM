  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, mild dry cough) matching Gold, correctly quotes the doctor's connection from D-39, and specifies the swab test from D-39; no factual errors or contradictions with Gold, though it omits patient-initiated concern and absence of other symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: symptom combination (loss of smell/taste/dry cough), doctor's explicit connection (D-39 quote), and specific test (swab, D-39); misses patient raising COVID worry (P-1), confirmation of absent symptoms (e.g., no fever P-10, no SOB P-11, etc.), 'pretty well' summary (D-16), narrow profile rationale, and self-isolation instructions (D-39), covering ~50-60% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript (symptoms in P-1/P-4/P-7, doctor's statement and test in D-39); citations to D-1/D-5 are approximate (symptoms primarily in patient responses post-D-1), but no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by specifying symptom combination, doctor's connection via quote, and test method; concise and focused with no off-topic content."
