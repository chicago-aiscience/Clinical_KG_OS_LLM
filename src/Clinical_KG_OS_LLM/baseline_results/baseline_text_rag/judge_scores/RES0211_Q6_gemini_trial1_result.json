  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the facts presented in both the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the duration and nature of the cough, the presence of fever and headache, the absence of sputum and asthma, and the details regarding sick contacts. It also accurately identifies Jessica's primary goal regarding medication.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a few specific elements found in the Gold Answer: 1) It omits the doctor's recap that Jessica is not taking any medications aside from Claritin; 2) It misses the doctor's framing of the visit's goal as 'next steps and where to go from here'; 3) It omits Jessica's secondary goal/priority of wanting to go home and lay down (P-61). According to the rubric, since it covers about 70% of the key points, it falls into the '3' range.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript (D-58 and P-60). There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question (clinical findings recap and primary goal) without including unnecessary information."
