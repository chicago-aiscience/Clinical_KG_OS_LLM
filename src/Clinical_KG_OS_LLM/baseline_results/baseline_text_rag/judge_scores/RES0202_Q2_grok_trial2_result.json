  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts stated in the Gold Answer that it covers, including the COVID swab test with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation due to compatible symptoms, isolation including the younger sister, and specific ER red flags (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting). No factual errors or contradictions; minor paraphrasing (e.g., 'compatible' vs. 'aligned') is acceptable.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab test (100%), isolation for 14 days (100%), isolation specifically from younger sister (100%), ER instructions (100%). Missed: full household composition (parents + sister from P-35), false-negative possibility and other viral illness, no medications/supportive care/wait for results, mother's acknowledgment (P-41), school requirement (P-41). Covers core management measures (~75-80% of key points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-44], citations accurate (e.g., test results, isolation details, ER criteria). No hallucinations; phrasing like 'symptoms compatible with COVID' is a faithful paraphrase of 'symptoms are aligned with symptoms of covid'. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by bullet-point listing diagnostic test, isolation instructions/duration, specific household member (younger sister) to isolate from, and related management (ER flags), with no off-topic content."
