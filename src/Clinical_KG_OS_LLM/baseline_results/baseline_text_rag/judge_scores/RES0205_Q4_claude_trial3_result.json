  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition, the COVID test as the diagnostic method, and the timing as two weeks ago at symptom onset, all consistent with the Gold Answer. It accurately captures the workplace concern about colleagues being scared. However, it omits the important detail that the patient works at a hospital and the significance of PPE use, which are key contextual elements in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the four main elements requested in the question (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns) but provides minimal detail compared to the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) the patient's specific role as a hospital clerk, (2) the heightened infectious disease risk in a hospital setting, (3) PPE usage demonstrating infection control awareness, (4) that the patient has been staying home since testing, and (5) the dual nature of workplace concerns (both social pressure and professional requirements). Covers approximately 60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. COVID-19 ruled out (P-35), COVID test performed (P-35), timing of two weeks ago at symptom onset (P-36), colleagues being scared (P-35), and desire to return without coughing (P-35, P-36) are all accurately cited. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all four components of the question: the condition (COVID-19), the test (COVID test), the timing (two weeks ago at symptom onset), and workplace concerns (colleagues scared, wanting to return without coughing). All content is on-topic with no tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all core facts (COVID-19 ruled out via COVID test at symptom onset two weeks ago, with workplace concerns about colleagues' fear) and is fully grounded in the transcript with perfect relevance to the question. However, it lacks the contextual depth of the Gold Answer, missing important details about the hospital setting, the patient's specific role, PPE usage, and the fuller picture of workplace-related concerns that made COVID-19 exclusion particularly important in this occupational context."
