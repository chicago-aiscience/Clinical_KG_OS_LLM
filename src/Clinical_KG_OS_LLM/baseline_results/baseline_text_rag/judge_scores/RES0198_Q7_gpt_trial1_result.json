  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes the duration as about one week and that congestion/stuffiness came first with a later shift to mostly runny nose (consistent with P-2 and P-3). However, it is factually incorrect in stating that information about constant vs intermittent symptoms was not available and that the patient did not answer the question—because the patient explicitly said the symptoms have been “pretty constant for the past week” (P-8). It also mis-cites speaker turns (duration is supported by P-1/P-2 rather than D-1/D-2; the onset/progression is supported by P-3 rather than D-3/D-4).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) ~1 week duration; (2) congestion first; (3) shift over the week to predominantly rhinorrhea. Key points missed: (1) initial description of symptoms as “on and off” (P-1) and reconciliation with later “pretty constant” (P-8); (2) explicit statement that symptoms were overall persistent/constant; (3) that symptoms were not improving prompting the visit (P-1); (4) possible influence of decongestants on congestion/runny nose (P-10). Overall, it captures only part of the requested chronology and omits the intermittency/constancy aspect entirely (and incorrectly denies it exists).",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not faithful to the transcript: the answer states the patient did not answer whether symptoms were constant/intermittent, which directly contradicts P-8. Citations are also inaccurate (referencing D-lines where the relevant information is in P-lines). Aside from these issues, the onset/progression content is grounded in P-3.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on the asked chronology (first symptom and shift to runny nose), but it fails to address an explicitly requested element (constant vs intermittent) and provides an incorrect statement about it. Still, there is no major off-topic content."
