{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the prescribed medication (matches P-23) and accurately describes the circumstance for the missed dose: the daughter’s birthday celebration changed the usual dinner routine, leading to forgetting the dose (matches P-24). No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It covers the two core elements asked and emphasized in the Gold Answer: (1) Keppra as the medication and (2) the daughter’s birthday/altered dinner routine as the reason for the missed dose. It omits explicitly stating the chronic condition is epilepsy (noted in Gold Answer via P-8) and does not include contextual details (isolated lapse vs ongoing adherence; relation to seizure), which are present in the Gold Answer though not strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript: Keppra (P-23) and the missed dose due to the birthday celebration and not having dinner at the usual time (P-24). No hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on what was asked: current medication for the chronic condition and the specific circumstance leading to the missed dose. No irrelevant content."
