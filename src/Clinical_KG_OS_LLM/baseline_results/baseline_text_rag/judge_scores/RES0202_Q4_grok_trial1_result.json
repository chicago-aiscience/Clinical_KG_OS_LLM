  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition from [D-45], accurately paraphrases the hypothetical scenario (cough or shortness of breath without fever), and states fever as the excluding finding, matching the Gold Answer's core facts without errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: condition (asthma), hypothetical presentation (cough/SOB without fever), excluding finding (fever), and citation [D-45]. Misses supporting details like exact quote, temperature specifics [P-1,P-2], no wheezing [P-7], uncertain SOB [P-8], and nuance on prioritization vs. permanent exclusion (covers ~85% of Gold points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-45]: asthma mentioned conditionally without fever/cough/SOB alone; fever leads to infection conclusion. Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by naming the condition (asthma) and excluding finding (fever) with precise context from transcript, no off-topic content."
