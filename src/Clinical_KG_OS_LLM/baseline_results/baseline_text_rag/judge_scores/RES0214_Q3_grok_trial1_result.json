  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies fever and sore throat as the specific symptoms leading to suspicion of infectious etiology like COVID-19, matching the Gold Answer's explicit reference in [D-53]; it also correctly states the lack of flu shot prompted influenza consideration, consistent with [D-53/P-53/D-54]. Citations are slightly off (D-1 is patient report, not doctor suspicion), but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) fever/sore throat [D-53] covered; (2) broader symptoms (muscle aches, fever, stuffy nose, sore throat [D-24]) missed; (3) husband's similar symptoms [D-53] missed; (4) no flu shot [P-53] covered. Covers core specific symptoms and vaccination info per question (~60-70% of Gold's elaborated points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: fever/sore throat from patient [P-1] and doctor [D-53/D-24]; no flu shot [P-53]; influenza possibility [D-54]. Citations verifiable (D-1/D-53/D-54 accurate references), no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by naming specific symptoms (fever, sore throat) for infectious/COVID suspicion and vaccination history (no flu shot) for influenza, with no off-topic content."
