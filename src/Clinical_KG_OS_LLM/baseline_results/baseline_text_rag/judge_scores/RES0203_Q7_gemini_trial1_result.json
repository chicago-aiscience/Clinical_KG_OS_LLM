  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is an aborted sentence fragment. It fails to provide any factual information regarding the symptom timeline, the relative onset of symptoms, or the patient's medical history as detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 100% of the key points. It does not mention the two-day duration, the simultaneous onset of symptoms, the consistent nature of the cough and sensory loss, or the fact that the patient had no prior history of these symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "While the fragment 'the patient reports that the loss of smell' is technically grounded in the transcript (P-1), the response is too incomplete to contain meaningful claims. It does not hallucinate, but it also does not provide information.",
    "relevance": "The response does not address the question. It terminates before providing any relevant details about symptom development or history."
