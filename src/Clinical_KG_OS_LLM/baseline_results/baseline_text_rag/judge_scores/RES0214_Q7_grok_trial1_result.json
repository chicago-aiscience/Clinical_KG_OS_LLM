  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is an incomplete sentence ('Based on the transcript excerpts, the patient's symptoms began') with no factual content provided. It does not mention any symptoms, their order, timeline, or comparison to the husband's onset, making it fully inconsistent with the Gold Answer's detailed facts—no facts are correct because none are stated.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) stuffy nose first 'just before' fever (P-1, D-2/P-2, D-3/P-3); (2) sore throat next/around fever onset, ongoing (P-1); (3) fever for 3 days (P-1, D-3); (4) muscle aches concurrent with fever (past 2-3 days, P-13/14, D-15, P-15/16); (5) husband symptoms for 1 week (~4 days before patient's fever, P-19/20); (6) staggered onset implying household transmission (D-51/53). Generated Answer covers 0% of these—no points addressed.",
    "faithfulness": "No specific claims about symptoms or timeline are made, so no hallucinations, but the partial sentence is verifiable as generic ('based on transcript'). However, it provides no content grounded in the transcript relevant to the question, effectively fabricating nothing but also verifying nothing substantive—largely ungrounded as an answer.",
    "relevance": "The answer starts with a phrase attempting to introduce symptom progression but stops without addressing chronology, other symptoms, or husband's timeline; it does not address the question."
