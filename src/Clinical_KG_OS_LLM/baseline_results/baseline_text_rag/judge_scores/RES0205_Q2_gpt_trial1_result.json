  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All statements in the Generated Answer match the Gold Answer and are supported by the transcript: the patient is not currently taking prescribed meds (P-23), previously took anxiety medication 2–3 years ago and stopped (P-24), and is managing reflux via dietary avoidance (P-25). No contradictory or incorrect claims are made.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer includes: (1) no current prescribed meds, (2) past anxiety medication stopped, and (3) current reflux management via diet. It omits several Gold Answer key points: (a) hay fever noted with no treatment described, (b) cough-related medication status—patient requests meds but none prescribed/recommended in the transcript, (c) clinician plan to do an exam/consult before next steps, and (d) explicit across-all-conditions summary (anxiety, reflux, hay fever, cough) that the patient is on zero medications. Overall it captures ~50–79% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript with the cited lines; no hallucinated treatments, prescriptions, or diagnoses are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question about current medication/treatment status and reflux management. However, it is somewhat narrow because it does not cover all conditions mentioned (hay fever, cough) as requested."
