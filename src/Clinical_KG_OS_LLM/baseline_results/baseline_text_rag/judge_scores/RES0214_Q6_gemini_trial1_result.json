  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab, the isolation precautions, and the physical exam.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses one key point from the Gold Answer: the clinician's statement that they would 'go talk to the Doctor' (consulting the supervisor) before returning. This was a specific 'next step' mentioned at the very end of the encounter (D-55).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript and correctly cites the relevant turn markers (D-52, D-53, D-54).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the question, although it is slightly less detailed regarding the final next step compared to the gold answer."
