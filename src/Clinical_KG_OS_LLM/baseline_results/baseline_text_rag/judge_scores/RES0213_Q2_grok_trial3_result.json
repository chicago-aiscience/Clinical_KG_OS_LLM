  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims 'Information not found in provided excerpts,' which is factually incorrect compared to the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer accurately cites [P-6] for Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer (tried for pain, ineffective) and [P-25] for multivitamin (regular routine), all directly from the transcript. This is a complete contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer tried for chest pain; (2) all ineffective ('hasn't really helped very much'); (3) daily multivitamin as regular routine; (4) no prescription medications; (5) stress management (reading, running); (6) trying to quit smoking. Generated Answer covers 0% of these points.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim 'Information not found in provided excerpts' is not verifiable and hallucinates absence of information explicitly present in [P-6] ('I've tried Tylenol and I've tried Advil um and I've even tried like a like an Alka-Seltzer and it hasn't really helped very much') and [P-25] ('Uh no, like I take like a multi vitamin but that's it'). No accurate citations or grounding.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question about specific OTC medications/supplements for pain/ routine and their effectiveness; it dismisses the query without providing any relevant information."
