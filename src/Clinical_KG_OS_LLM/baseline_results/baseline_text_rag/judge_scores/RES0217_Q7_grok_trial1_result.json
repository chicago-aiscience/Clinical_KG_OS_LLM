  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly describes the timeline sequence of hiking on Friday, gardening on Saturday, noticing soreness behind the knee leading to tick discovery, and bringing the tick in a plastic container (all matching Gold and transcript P-1). The engorgement comparison is accurate: current tick less swollen/small bug-like vs. prior quite swollen/not grape-like (P-3, D-4, consistent with Gold). No factual errors or contradictions; minor omissions (e.g., uncertainty of attachment, >72h estimate) but core facts align. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: hiking Friday [P-1], gardening Saturday [P-1], soreness behind knee leading to discovery [P-1], brought tick in container [P-1], prior ~10y ago, engorgement contrast (current smaller/not as engorged, small bug vs grape [P-3,D-4]). Missed: uncertainty when attached/hope from hiking not garden [P-1], 'earlier today' discovery [P-1], precise location (left knee crease) [P-1,D-1], doctor's >72h estimate [D-6], prior bullseye rash & antibiotics explicitly [P-3], current symptoms (local red/tender, no larger circle rash [P-6]). Covers ~50-60% of key points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in cited transcript sections (P-1 for timeline, P-3/D-4 for engorgement); paraphrases accurate (e.g., 'small bug than a swollen grape' from P-4 'pretty small' and D-4 'tiny little bug...little grape'). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or inaccurate citations. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question's timeline (hiking->gardening->discovery->doctor) and comparison (engorgement and starts symptoms vs. prior); no off-topic content despite truncation. Perfectly focused. Score: 5."
