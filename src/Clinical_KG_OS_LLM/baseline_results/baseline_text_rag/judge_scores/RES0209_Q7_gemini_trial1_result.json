  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the initial statements in the transcript (diagnosis at 8, baseline use 1x/2 weeks). However, it identifies the duration as 'past week', whereas the transcript (P-13) and Gold Answer clarify it has been two weeks. The truncated nature of the response also prevents a full assessment of its accuracy regarding the current exacerbation.",
    "completeness": "The answer is highly incomplete. It misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the patient's current age (10), specific triggers (exercise, cold), the escalation to 5-6 uses per week (explicitly asked for in the prompt), nighttime symptoms, and the exclusion of other infections. Most significantly, the text cuts off mid-sentence.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made (diagnosis age, baseline frequency, cough, shortness of breath) are all directly supported by the transcript. There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer starts to address the prompt's requirements by outlining the chronological progression, but it fails to address the final part of the question regarding the current usage frequency and the full extent of the exacerbation due to the abrupt ending."
