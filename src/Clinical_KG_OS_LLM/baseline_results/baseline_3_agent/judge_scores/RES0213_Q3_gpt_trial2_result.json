  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s main diagnostic conclusion (anxiety/stress-related chest pain) aligns with the Gold Answer’s diagnosis of anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain. However, it introduces the label “Functional Chest Pain,” which is not used in the Gold Answer and can imply a different construct (often GI-related functional chest pain) unless clearly tied to anxiety. It also overstates dyspnea: the patient says she breathes faster when nervous and that deep breaths are hard because it makes her nervous, but she denies intrinsic breathing difficulty (“I don't have a hard time breathing otherwise”) [P-19]. Aside from these issues, the stress/anxiety linkage is accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer supports included: (1) academic stress/thesis time crunch [P-13, P-15, P-16] (covered partially—mentions P-13, P-15 but not the time-crunch detail from P-16); (2) prior anxiety attacks and concern they may return [P-21, P-22] (covered partially—mentions history but not that she feels they could return); (3) nervous hyperventilation/subjective difficulty with deep breaths due to anxiety [P-19] (covered but with slight overstatement); (4) patient attribution to stress [P-8] (covered). Major missing Gold points: the hallmark situational/distraction pattern (pain when alone with thoughts; improves when talking/with others/occupied) [P-4, P-9, P-29]; and the pertinent negatives supporting anxiety over cardiopulmonary causes (no fevers [P-12], no exertional worsening [P-10], occurs at rest [D-11, P-11], no palpitations except during anxiety [P-20], no asthma [P-23, P-24]). Overall, it covers roughly about half to two-thirds of the Gold Answer’s key supporting observations.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript and appropriately cited (academic stress, prior anxiety, patient considering stress, nervous breathing changes). The main faithfulness issue is describing “shortness of breath” as a symptom, when the patient explicitly denies true breathing difficulty outside anxiety-driven faster breathing [P-19]. Also, the “Functional Chest Pain” label is not stated in the transcript (though it is presented as an interpretive diagnosis). These are limited but notable departures; the rest is transcript-consistent.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question: it proposes an anxiety/stress-related diagnosis and lists consultation observations supporting it. It stays focused on the clinical reasoning without irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "The answer identifies the correct overarching diagnosis (anxiety/stress-related chest pain) and cites several supporting findings, but it omits the key alone-versus-distracted pattern and several pertinent negatives, and slightly overstates dyspnea."
