  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies 'acute bronchitis' as the diagnosis, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it fails to mention the broader diagnostic possibilities included in the Gold Answer, such as 'acute lower respiratory tract infection' or 'bacterial superinfection/early community-acquired pneumonia'. Additionally, it attributes its reasoning to a 'Knowledge Graph' which does not exist in the provided context.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key nuances from the Gold Answer. Specifically, it does not explain 'how' the features contribute in medical terms (e.g., 'systemic inflammatory response' or 'transition from simple irritation to active inflammation'). It also omits the important context that no vitals, labs, or imaging were provided to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' within the provided materials to justify its claims. While the transcript citations (P-2, P-4, D-47) are accurate to the text, the reliance on a non-existent external source for the logical links is a breach of faithfulness to the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the question by naming a diagnosis and discussing the three clinical features requested (productive cough, sputum color, and subjective fever)."
