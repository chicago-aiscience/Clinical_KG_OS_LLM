  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer accurately cites [D-43] for doctor's plan to consult supervising physician and return; Generated incorrectly states no information on doctor's plan exists, a direct contradiction. Gold identifies self-care as Tylenol (partial help [P-14]), expectoration (temporary relief [P-13]), and resting/avoiding exertion [P-10]; Generated only mentions Tylenol correctly but misses others. Gold lists aggravating factors as deep breathing [P-18], coughing worsening chest pain [P-19], exertion/stairs [P-10/11]; Generated wrongly identifies only coughing for throat rawness [P-15], missing key pleuritic/exertional factors. Generated hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' support not in transcript. Significant factual errors and contradictions vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Doctor's plan [D-43]; 2) Self-care: Tylenol [P-14], expectoration [P-13], resting [P-10]; 3) Aggravating: deep breathing [P-18], coughing on pain [P-19], exertion [P-10/11], no others [P-12]; 4) Alleviating: Tylenol, expectoration, resting; 5) Clinical relevance of pleuritic/exertional symptoms. Generated covers only Tylenol partially (~1/10 key points), misses plan entirely, wrong/incomplete agg/allev. Covers <50%, closer to 20-49%.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites [P-14] and [P-15] accurately from transcript. However, claims no doctor's plan info despite clear [D-43]; misinterprets [P-15] sore throat as main aggravating vs chest pain; fabricates 'Knowledge Graph' and its links (TREATMENT: tylenol --[TREATS]--> [SYMPTOM] chest pain), not verifiable in provided transcript. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements, misses many transcript-grounded claims like [D-43],[P-13],[P-18],[P-10].",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response directly around the three question components (Doctor's plan, Self-care, Aggravating, Alleviating factors), using bold headings matching query; no off-topic content or tangents, fully addresses question format despite inaccuracies."
