  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer misidentifies and omits several clinician screening targets and misattributes some lines of questioning.\n- It is directionally correct that the clinician explored cardiac causes and anxiety/stress, but it fails to cite the key cardiac screening questions actually used (exertional component [D-10], rest pain [D-11], palpitations [D-20], family sudden death/arrhythmia screening [D-31–D-32]).\n- It incorrectly states the doctor asked about response to OTC meds; the transcript shows the patient volunteered trying Tylenol/Advil/Alka-Seltzer [P-6] without a preceding doctor question.\n- It introduces unsupported speculation (e.g., ruling out “gastritis”) and repeatedly uses “likely,” which does not match the question asking what the doctor specifically asked.\nOverall, there are notable factual/attribution errors and missing key screening elements, so correctness is low.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key ruled-out screens and corresponding questions include: (1) traumatic/musculoskeletal injury (accidents/injuries), (2) cardiac/exertional angina features (exercise worsening, rest pain, palpitations), (3) infectious illness exposure/fever, (4) asthma (childhood/current), (5) dyspnea, (6) inherited arrhythmia/sudden death history.\n\nGenerated Answer covers only:\n- Cardiac disease (partially, but misses the main exclusion questions used)\n- Anxiety/stress (partially)\n\nIt omits entirely:\n- Trauma/injury screening\n- Fever/illness + sick contacts\n- Asthma screening\n- Explicit dyspnea screen as its own excluded condition (it mentions breathing in anxiety context but not as a ruled-out primary dyspnea screen)\n- Inherited arrhythmia/sudden death screening\n\nThis is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not grounded in the transcript:\n- “Based on transcript and knowledge graph” (knowledge graph not part of evidence).\n- Claims the doctor asked about OTC medication response; not supported.\n- Suggests ruling out “gastritis or muscle strain” via OTC response; not stated.\n- Several “doctor likely asked” statements are speculative rather than anchored to specific transcript questions.\n\nSome content is grounded (stress questions, smoking discussion exists), but there are multiple hallucinated/unsupported attributions.",
    "relevance": "The answer is aimed at the right task (conditions screened and questions used), but it does not follow the prompt requirement to list what was specifically asked and effectively ruled out, and it omits many of the actual screened/rule-out conditions. It remains mostly on-topic but only partially addresses the full scope."
