  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four key symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness) matching the Gold Answer's main points. Minor discrepancy in cough duration (week vs. two weeks per P-13). Misses details like wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use (P-17) and expanded breathing difficulty ('hard time breathing' P-19). Significant error: claims no nighttime details despite P-18 explicitly stating symptoms occur 'every other day or every two days,' less than daytime, contradicting Gold. Wrong citation for chest tightness (P-4 incorrect; should be P-20). Overall, some factual errors but core symptoms correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Dry cough ~2 weeks, nonstop daytime (partial: misses precise duration); 2) Breathing difficulty (SOB + hard time breathing when severe - covers SOB only); 3) Wheezing a lot, more frequent than bronchodilator (covers 'a lot' only); 4) Chest tightness (covered); 5) Day prominent/near-constant vs. night every other/2 days, less frequent (covers daytime partial, misses all nighttime). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable except: chest tightness cites P-4 (incorrect; P-4 is about bronchodilator, actual confirmation P-20); nighttime frequency falsely stated as absent despite direct transcript evidence in P-18 ('nighttime symptoms don't happen as much... every other day'). Introduces plausible but extra 'asthma exacerbation' label. Multiple inaccuracies (wrong citation, hallucinated absence of nighttime data).",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around specific symptoms (cough character, breathing difficulties, wheezing, chest sensations) and daytime/nighttime frequency differences, with no irrelevant content or tangents."
