  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the teenage history of anxiety, current smoking reduction, academic stress related to the Masters thesis, and the onset of chest pain 1.5 weeks ago. However, it misses the specific detail that smoking started at age 18 and that it escalated to 10 cigarettes a day for two years. It also omits the patient's father's heart attack, which is a key historical fact mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several chronological milestones present in the Gold Answer: the specific age (18) smoking began, the two-year period of smoking 10 cigarettes a day, the 8-year gap where anxiety was dormant, and most importantly, the father's heart attack last year. It covers the major phases requested in the prompt but lacks the depth of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical facts mentioned are found in the transcript. The generated answer mentions a 'knowledge graph' twice, which is not part of the provided source text, suggesting a minor hallucination of the context/tools available, although the clinical details associated with it (heart flutters, shortness of breath) are indeed in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, specifically addressing the timeline and the relationships between the phases of stress, anxiety, and physical symptoms as requested by the prompt."
