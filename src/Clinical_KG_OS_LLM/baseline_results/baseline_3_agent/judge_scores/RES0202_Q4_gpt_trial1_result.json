  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies **asthma** as the condition the doctor would have added if the presentation were different, and correctly states the differentiating feature was **absence vs presence of fever** (doctor: would consider asthma if cough/SOB without fever; current case has fever so sounds infectious). No clinically meaningful contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the two core required elements: (1) asthma would be added if cough/SOB without fever, and (2) fever/high temperature led the doctor to not pursue asthma in the current workup and to favor infection. It does not include the Gold Answer’s additional supporting details (e.g., lack of wheeze, unclear SOB, nuance that asthma isn’t permanently ruled out), but those are supportive rather than essential to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Key claims are directly grounded in the transcript, especially [D-45] and fever in [P-1]. The phrase “based on the… knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript, but it does not introduce a substantive new clinical fact. Overall, the answer is well-grounded with only a minor unverifiable framing element.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what condition would be added and what specific finding excluded it from the current workup, with no meaningful tangents."
