  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies COVID-19 as the potential infectious exposure source from the social history, whereas the Gold Answer specifies the nephew attending daycare (P-11) as the source; it also assumes diabetes directly affects immune function and necessitates specific management, but the Gold notes no explicit link in the transcript, leading to major factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: type 1 diabetes (P-23, P-25); missed entirely: nephew/daycare exposure (P-11, P-12), plausibility despite nephew not sick, consistency with viral URI (D-39), diabetes details (P-24, P-26), no explicit immune link, symptom duration (P-1, P-2); covers only ~20-30% (diabetes mention and vague management).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like COVID-19 as 'identified exposure source through social history' not verifiable (social history points to nephew P-11, COVID is differential D-39); diabetes 'affect[ing] immune function' plausible but not in transcript; hydration/isolation accurate (D-39), but overall multiple ungrounded claims and misattribution.",
    "relevance": "Fails to address 'social history' exposure source (nephew/daycare), instead focusing on COVID differential and general management; partially touches diabetes relation but off-topic for core question."
