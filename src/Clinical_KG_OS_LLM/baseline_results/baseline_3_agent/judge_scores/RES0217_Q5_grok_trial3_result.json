  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the tick attachment duration reasoning, matching the Gold Answer's citation of P-1 (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday) and D-6 (>72 hours, prophylactic antibiotics). However, it incorrectly claims 'the provided transcript does not contain evidence' of the doctor using an 'Ontario Lyme disease distribution map' or Strathroy's position to justify treatment, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [D-13], which explicitly mentions the map and states 'Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics.' This is a significant factual error on the second half of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Hiking Fri/gardening Sat contribute to >72h estimate via uncertainty [P-1] and doctor's calculation [D-6]; (2) Doctor uses Strathroy location on Ontario Lyme map as concerning [P-12, D-13] to justify antibiotics. Generated covers (1) fully but entirely misses/denies (2), covering ~50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about duration are verifiable [P-1, D-6]. Patient location [P-12] cited accurately. However, assertion that 'transcript does not contain evidence' of map or Strathroy justification is false/hallucinated, as D-13 directly states 'Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario' and assesses Strathroy as 'concerning point' leading to antibiotics. Other listed justifications (e.g., D-18 exposure risks, P-1 symptoms) are present but not primary for map question and introduce minor irrelevance.",
    "relevance": "Answer is structured to directly address both parts of the question with bolded sections (**Estimated Tick Attachment Duration** and **Use of Geographic Distribution or Map**), staying focused without off-topic content, even though second part is factually wrong."
