  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, correctly states a swab test was ordered, correctly gives the 48-hour turnaround time, and accurately reports the isolation/no-contact instructions while awaiting results. No statements contradict the Gold Answer or transcript. Minor wording (“to confirm the diagnosis”) is consistent with the intent of ruling out COVID-19.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) COVID-19 to be ruled out, (2) swab ordered today, (3) results back in 48 hours, (4) isolate at home and not see anyone else. Misses one Gold Answer element: that after results return the patient would get “further instructions from public health.” Thus, slightly less than full coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript: patient concern about COVID [P-1], doctor’s rationale and ordering a swab with 48-hour results and isolation advice [D-39]. No evident hallucinations; citations align with the quoted content.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question (condition, test, turnaround time, and instructions) with no extraneous or off-topic information."
