  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links seasonal allergies to atopic constitution and asthma risk, recurrent virals to airway inflammation/hyperresponsiveness, new carpets as potential irritant without temporal link, cold as non-allergic trigger, plus other env factors and exercise/rest pattern to hyperresponsive airways. Generated covers these links similarly (atopic susceptibility, viral vulnerability, carpets irritant, cold exacerbator) tied to exercise wheezing, but introduces unmentioned 'Knowledge Graph' causal links (e.g., viral CAUSES wheezy), calls it 'acute exacerbation' despite first episode [P-4], and omits no-abx detail [P-16], asthma suggestion, other env denials. Core facts align with minor additions/discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: allergies+OTC to atopy/asthma [P-35/36]; recurrent virals no abx trigger inflammation [P-15/16]; carpets potential irritant no link [P-54]; cold non-allergic trigger [P-38]; other env ok (smoke/pets/stoves/filters [P-53-57]); exercise trigger/rest resolve [P-3/6/41] -> hyperresponsive airways. Generated covers allergies susceptibility [P-35/36], virals vulnerability [P-15], cold worsens [P-38], carpets contribute [P-54], exercise pattern [P-3/41]; adds presentation. Misses explicit asthma, no-abx, other env assessments, rest resolution, carpet temporal nuance (~80% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated citations [P-1,2,3,15,35,36,38,41,54] accurate to transcript. Claims like allergies contribute susceptibility, cold worsens, exercise trigger grounded. However, multiple 'Knowledge Graph' references (viral CAUSES wheezy, cold WORSENS wheezy, carpets ASSOCIATED wheezy, Reactine TAKEN_FOR allergies) not in transcript (plausible medically but unverified/hallucinated here); 'acute exacerbation' implies prior similar despite [P-4] denial. Some plausible extras, not fully fabricated.",
    "relevance": "Question asks how specific factors (allergies, recurrent virals, new carpets, cold sensitivity) collectively relate to exercise-induced wheezing/distress. Generated structures directly around these (sections 2-4), ties to exercise pattern/presentation/conclusion, no off-topic content."
