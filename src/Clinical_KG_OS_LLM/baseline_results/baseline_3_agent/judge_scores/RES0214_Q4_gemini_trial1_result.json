  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnostic test as a 'covid swab' and accurately identifies the primary rationale for prioritization as the household transmission pattern (husband being sick). These points align perfectly with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the diagnostic test and the main rationale (household transmission). However, it misses two key nuances from the Gold Answer: 1) the urgency of containment via self-isolation as part of the rationale, and 2) the specific sequence where influenza was only considered after learning about the patient's flu shot status.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer repeatedly cites a 'Knowledge Graph' to support its claims. This 'Knowledge Graph' is not part of the provided transcript or the Gold Answer, constituting a hallucination of source material. While the medical facts themselves are present in the transcript, the attribution to an external knowledge structure is unfaithful to the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly answering both parts of the question without unnecessary tangents, despite the hallucinated source citations."
