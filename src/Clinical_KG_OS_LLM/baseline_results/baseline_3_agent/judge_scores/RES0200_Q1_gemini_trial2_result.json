  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states that the patient did not endorse any systemic symptoms; however, the transcript (P-29) shows the patient endorsed feeling 'a bit chilly' over the last couple of days. It also misses the 'chest discomfort' endorsed during coughing fits (P-13). The respiratory symptoms and sputum changes are correctly identified.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly incomplete. It misses several key endorsed symptoms (chills, chest discomfort). More importantly, it fails to list the specific negative symptoms requested in the prompt (orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations, fever), instead listing a random subset of other denials.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer claims no systemic symptoms were endorsed, which is a hallucination/error as the patient explicitly mentioned chills. Other details provided are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the general structure of the question but fails to provide the specific information requested in the prompt's examples (orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, etc.), making it only partially relevant to the user's specific query."
