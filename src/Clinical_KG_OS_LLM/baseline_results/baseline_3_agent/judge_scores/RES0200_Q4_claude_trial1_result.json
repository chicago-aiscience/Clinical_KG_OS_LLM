  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All three key facts align with the Gold Answer and are accurately extracted from [D-52]. The Generated Answer uses 'Covid' instead of 'COVID-19' but this is a minor stylistic difference that does not affect factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three main components required by the question: alternative diagnosis (COVID), diagnostic test (COVID swab), and turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, it lacks the contextual detail provided in the Gold Answer about specific overlapping symptoms (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) and the explanation from [D-52] about why the overlap warranted testing. The Gold Answer also notes the symptom from [P-29] about chills, which adds completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is fully grounded in the transcript with accurate citations to [D-52]. All claims are verifiable: the doctor explicitly mentions COVID symptom overlap, orders a COVID swab, and specifies the 24-48 hour timeframe. No hallucinated information is present. The answer is concise and sticks to what is directly stated in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question with focused, relevant information. It uses a clear bullet-point format that organizes the response effectively. There is no off-topic content, and every statement relates to answering the specific question asked about alternative diagnosis, diagnostic test, and turnaround time."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate and well-grounded information that directly addresses all components of the question. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time, all with proper citations. While slightly less complete than the Gold Answer in contextual detail about overlapping symptoms, it covers all essential points with perfect faithfulness to the source material and maintains excellent relevance throughout."
