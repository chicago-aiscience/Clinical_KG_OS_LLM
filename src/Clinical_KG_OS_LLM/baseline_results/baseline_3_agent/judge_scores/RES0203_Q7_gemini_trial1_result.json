  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly accurate but fails to correctly identify that the transcript explicitly records the patient denying prior symptoms. The generated answer states there is 'no mention' of prior history, whereas the transcript at [D-3/P-3] contains a direct question and a negative response ('No, no, nothing like this').",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses some secondary details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific nature of the sensory loss (being able to smell strong odors/taste salty foods but not bananas) and the doctor's summary that these symptoms are consistent with COVID-19.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful, though the claim that there is 'no mention' of prior history is a slight misinterpretation of the text (it was mentioned and denied, rather than not being mentioned at all).",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question: onset timing, progression/fluctuation, and prior history."
