  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer. It correctly identifies the test (COVID swab) and the primary reason for prioritization (household transmission from the husband). It correctly cites relevant sections of the transcript (D-53, P-1).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the majority of the gold answer's points but misses two nuances regarding why COVID was prioritized specifically *over* influenza: 1) the urgency of containment/self-isolation as a driver for prioritizing the more transmissible/dangerous COVID-19, and 2) the fact that influenza was only introduced as a secondary possibility after the COVID workup was decided and the patient's flu shot status was confirmed.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript. While it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source text, the actual clinical information (symptoms, husband's transmission) is directly present in the transcript. The claims are verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question: the specific test and the rationale for prioritization over influenza."
