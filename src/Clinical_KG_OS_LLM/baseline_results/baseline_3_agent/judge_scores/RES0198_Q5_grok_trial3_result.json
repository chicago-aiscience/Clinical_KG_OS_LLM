  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies the nephew attending daycare (P-11, P-12) as the potential infectious exposure source from social history, noting daycare as a common source of respiratory viruses despite the nephew not being sick. The Generated Answer incorrectly states COVID-19 as the exposure source identified through social history, which is not supported; COVID is a differential prompted by pandemic context and symptoms (D-39), not social history. It also infers a direct link between type 1 diabetes and immune function affecting management, but the transcript and Gold Answer note no explicit linkage by the doctor. These are significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: nephew in daycare as exposure (P-11), lives with patient, daycare virus source, nephew not sick but possible (P-12), consistent with viral URI (D-39), T1D diagnosed age 7 (P-23-24), insulin/endo managed (P-25-26), no explicit immune link, no other meds/allergies/hosp (P-27-29), symptoms 1 week no improvement (P-1-2). Covered: T1D mention (partial), supportive care/hydration/isolation (D-39). Missed: nephew/daycare entirely (core), daycare risk explanation, no immune link noted, diabetes details, symptom duration context. Covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Verifiable: symptoms like stuffy/runny nose (P-1-3), T1D (P-23,25), swab for COVID/hydration/isolation (D-39). Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'COVID-19' as identified exposure source from social history (social history points to nephew, not COVID; D-39 is assessment/differential, likely viral cold); diabetes 'may affect immune function' necessitating management (plausible but not stated in transcript; doctor doesn't link). Multiple hallucinated interpretations of source and immune relation.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on 'social history' exposure source and relation to presentation with T1D/immune impact. Generated addresses potential COVID (from exam conclusion, not social history) and T1D management (hydration/isolation), partially touching presentation but completely misses social history source (nephew), substituting irrelevant COVID focus instead of viral URI context."
