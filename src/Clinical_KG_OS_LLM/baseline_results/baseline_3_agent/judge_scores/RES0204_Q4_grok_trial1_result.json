  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition ruled out despite family history in the grandparents, accurately lists the mother's cited symptoms (shortness of breath and wheezing not exhibited even during physical activity), and properly cites [P-28], matching the Gold Answer's core facts with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: asthma as condition, positive family history in grandparents, ruled out by mother, specific symptoms not exhibited (shortness of breath, wheezing even during physical activity) with citation [P-28]. Missed points: doctor prompting the history [D-28/D-30], 'been worked up for that,' mother's conclusion 'he doesn't have that,' patient's healthy history [P-24], and notation on absence being notable given FH (covers ~85% of Gold's points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [P-28] (grandparents' asthma, no shortness of breath/wheezing even with physical activity); accurate citation; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers the question by naming asthma, noting family history context, and detailing the exact mother-cited pertinent negatives including during physical activity; no off-topic content."
