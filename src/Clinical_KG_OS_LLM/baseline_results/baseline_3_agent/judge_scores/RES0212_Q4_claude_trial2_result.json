    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly identifies constitutional symptoms screened - the transcript shows the doctor explicitly asked about fevers [D-4], night sweats [D-5], and weight loss [D-6-D-8], but the Generated Answer only vaguely mentions 'sleep disturbance and general illness.' It completely misses the key constitutional symptoms that were specifically screened. It incorrectly lists 'Cat Exposure' and 'Substance Use' as relevant to TB screening when these were general history questions. The Gold Answer correctly identifies the specific constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis) and exposure risks (sick contacts, travel, IV drug use) that are relevant for TB screening.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses multiple key points from the Gold Answer: (1) specific constitutional symptoms screened - night sweats with soaked sheets, unexplained weight loss, loose-fitting clothes; (2) critical exposure risks - sick contacts at pole dancing class, recent contacts, roommate status, travel history, IV drug use; (3) the clinical significance of these questions for TB screening; (4) additional symptoms screened like stiff neck, nausea/vomiting, body pain. It covers less than 30% of the key screening questions identified in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains some hallucinated content. It claims the doctor 'specifically assessed for sleep disturbance' in [D-47], but D-47 is actually the doctor's summary statement, not a specific screening question. The answer also mischaracterizes cat exposure and substance use questions as being relevant to TB/chronic infection screening when they were general history questions. However, it does correctly cite that hemoptysis was screened and the patient's smoking status was assessed.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question but provides incorrect and incomplete information. While it tries to identify screened symptoms and excluded conditions, it focuses on less relevant details (cat exposure, general substance use) rather than the TB-specific screening questions (night sweats, weight loss, travel, sick contacts, IV drug use) that are central to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It incorrectly identifies which constitutional symptoms were screened, missing the key TB-screening questions (night sweats, weight loss) explicitly asked in the transcript. It includes irrelevant details (cat exposure) while omitting critical exposure risk screening (sick contacts, travel history, IV drug use). The answer contains factual errors and some hallucinated interpretations, particularly in how it characterizes D-47. It addresses the question topic but provides substantially incorrect and incomplete information compared to the Gold Answer, covering less than 30% of the key screening elements that would help exclude TB and other chronic infections."
