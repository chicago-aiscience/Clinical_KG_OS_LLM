  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript and Gold Answer on the core items it includes: sudden shortness of breath [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure the prior night [P-8], and measured temperature 37.4°C [P-5]. No incorrect or contradictory statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) sudden-onset shortness of breath, (2) cough described as dry/no sputum, (3) seizure the prior night, (4) objective fever measurement of 37.4°C.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (1) cough also began suddenly that morning [D-2, P-2], (2) symptom timing estimate (~3 hours before consult) [P-11], (3) neurologic history of epilepsy/seizure disorder [P-8], (4) patient felt fine after the seizure [P-8], (5) confirmation fever was measured that morning [D-6, P-6], and Gold’s listed pertinent negatives (e.g., no chest pain, no faintness, etc.). Overall this is a partial capture of the Gold Answer details.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript with accurate citations; no apparent hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked domains (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptom, and objective fever measurement) without irrelevant content."
