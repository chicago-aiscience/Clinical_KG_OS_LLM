  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly accurate regarding the medications (Reactine/OTC) and the lack of prescriptions. However, it states the patient is currently being evaluated for a 'viral infection.' In the transcript (P-15), the mother mentions that past episodes over the last two years were viral infections, but the current episode of wheezing is undiagnosed and is the reason for the visit. The Gold Answer correctly identifies that for current episodes, the patient takes nothing and they resolve with rest, whereas the generated answer uses a more passive 'transcript does not mention' phrasing.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main medications (Reactine) and the absence of prescriptions. It misses two key details found in the Gold Answer: 1) that current episodes specifically resolve with 'rest' [P-33, P-34], and 2) the specific mention that past infections did not require antibiotics [P-16].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucination by referencing a 'knowledge graph [KG]' which was not provided in the source transcript. It also misattributes the reason for the current evaluation as a 'viral infection,' which is a detail linked to past medical history in the transcript rather than the current clinical assessment.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the question about medications and treatments for both current and other conditions, as well as the status of prescribed medications."
