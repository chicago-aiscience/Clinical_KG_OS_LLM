  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain details regarding the patient's self-adherence behaviors (skipping maintenance doses and failing to refill the rescue inhaler). However, these details are explicitly discussed in the transcript (P-17, P-18, P-19, P-20, and D-34). The Gold Answer correctly identifies these citations and links them to the clinical picture, while the generated answer misses this core relationship.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover the primary key points regarding the relationship between the patient's behaviors and their symptoms. It misses the explanation of how reduced maintenance and the lack of a rescue inhaler (fast-acting bronchodilator) contribute to the current distress. It only addresses the general asthma history and the doctor's suspicion of recurrence.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It claims information is missing when it is present and introduces a 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' as a source of information, which is not part of the provided transcript or context. This constitutes a hallucination of both the absence of data and the presence of external evidence.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it mentions the asthma history and symptoms, it fails to address the specific 'how' requested in the question regarding the combination of history, skipped doses, and lack of refills, primarily because it incorrectly believes that information is unavailable."
