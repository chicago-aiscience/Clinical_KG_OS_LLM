  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the key respiratory symptoms (wheezy, difficulty taking deep breaths, out of breath/shortness of breath, slight cough) with correct citations matching the Gold Answer and transcript. However, it has a factual error on the earliest symptoms: it claims all symptoms were present since the start based on the wheezy duration in [P-1], but the Gold Answer correctly identifies wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths as the first noticed per [P-2], and notes the cough as more recent ('now' in [P-1]). This misrepresents the timing distinction.",
    "completeness": "Covers main symptoms from Gold (wheezy [P-1,P-2], SOB/out of breath [P-1,P-3], cough [P-1], difficulty deep breaths [P-2]). Misses key points: cough as recent/non-productive [P-1,P-31], hard time catching breath/no cyanosis [P-32], looks fine otherwise [P-9], and precise earliest distinction. Covers ~60-70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All listed symptoms and citations ([P-1],[P-2],[P-3]) are directly verifiable in the transcript with no fabrication. The interpretive claim that 'all reported symptoms ... [were] present since the issue started' is not explicitly stated (cough is 'now' [P-1], earliest specified in [P-2]), making it a minor unverifiable detail but plausible and mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing specific symptoms at presentation with citations and directly discussing the earliest symptoms in the context of the 4-5 day onset, with no off-topic content."
