  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer lists multiple targeted screening questions (night sweats, sputum/phlegm, severe allergic reactions/epipen, personal/family asthma, eczema, rash, GI symptoms, joint pain) and Jessica’s specific denials/clarifications. The Generated Answer largely discusses only asthma and then adds an interpretive conclusion of “viral URI/common cold,” which is not part of what the question asks for. It also contains a clear factual/citation error: it says Jessica confirmed she does not have asthma at [P-1], but the asthma denial occurs at [P-29]. While it correctly notes the doctor summarized “you don’t have asthma” at [D-58] and that the brother had a cold a few weeks ago ([P-39]/[D-58]), overall it does not accurately reproduce the requested set of screened conditions and responses.",
    "completeness": "It misses most key screening elements in the Gold Answer: (1) night sweats question and response, (2) productive cough/phlegm denial, (3) severe allergy features (breathing difficulty/facial swelling) and EpiPen confirmation, (4) eczema screening and denial, (5) rash/skin changes denial, (6) GI symptom denials, (7) joint pain denial, and (8) family asthma details (cousin only). It only partially covers personal asthma (and even that with an incorrect citation). Overall coverage is well under 20% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded or are inaccurately referenced: the asthma denial is mis-cited ([P-1] instead of [P-29]); the mention of a “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript; and the claim that the doctor was “aiming to rule out respiratory conditions beyond the scope of a simple viral infection” is speculative. Some content is grounded (dry cough/scratchy throat; feeling hot; seasonal allergies; brother sick), but the answer omits many transcript-supported screening questions and introduces unsupported framing.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for the specific conditions screened via targeted questioning (explicit examples: asthma, eczema, EpiPen-level allergic reactions, night sweats) and Jessica’s responses that narrowed the differential. The Generated Answer focuses mostly on asthma and a general viral-URI narrative, and it does not enumerate the systematic screening items requested. Thus it is only partially addressing the question."
