  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately quotes the patient's initial statements from P-1 and P-8. However, it fails to include the clarifying information from P-4 where the patient specifies that the loss is partial, not complete. By only citing P-1 for taste ('lost my sense of taste'), it conveys a less accurate picture of the patient's condition compared to the Gold Answer, which correctly identifies the deficits as partial.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details requested by the prompt and included in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits that the patient could still smell 'really bad' things, could still taste 'really salty foods,' but could not taste 'normal things' like a 'banana.' It also misses the detail that the cough was non-productive (no sputum/blood) and lacked triggers.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly quoted or derived from the transcript (specifically P-1 and P-8). There are no hallucinations, although there is significant omission of relevant details found elsewhere in the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's primary focus (identifying symptoms) but largely ignores the second half of the prompt, which explicitly asked for the degree of loss (partial vs. complete) and details about what could and could not be perceived. It provides only the most general statements rather than the specific details requested. Mentioning the consistency of the cough is relevant but secondary to the sensory details requested in the prompt's tail end. It scores lower because it fails to answer a specific instruction within the question ('Include any details...')."
