  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate based on the transcript. It correctly identifies the duration (72 hours) and the prior history of a bullseye rash. However, it generalizes the geographic risk to 'hiking and gardening' rather than the specific location of Strathroy and the doctor's reference to the Ontario distribution map mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific mention of Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map. 2) The patient's specific comment that 'all ticks in this area' are now considered carriers, which explains why they proceeded despite it not looking like a deer tick. 3) The doctor's plan to send the tick for species identification. It covers about 60% of the specific nuances provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. The mention of a 'knowledge graph' regarding hiking/gardening is an external reference but the underlying logic is present in the dialogue. No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the question, focusing on the combination of factors that led to the recommendation of prophylactic antibiotics."
