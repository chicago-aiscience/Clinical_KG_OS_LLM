  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Anxiety-Induced or Functional Chest Pain, which is consistent with the Gold Answer's conclusion. It accurately references the specific clinical details from the transcript such as the duration of pain, the specific stressors (Masters thesis), and the history of anxiety.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two significant components found in the Gold Answer. First, it fails to explicitly list the situational pattern (pain when alone vs. resolution when distracted/social) as a supporting clinical observation, even though this was highlighted in the prompt's preamble. Second, it omits the 'pertinent negatives' (lack of fever, lack of exertional worsening, no asthma) which are crucial in clinical reasoning to rule out organic pathology. It covers about 66% of the key points compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in the provided transcript. The citations [P-15, P-13, P-21, P-3, P-6, P-19, P-8] are accurate and correctly correspond to the patient's statements. No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly answering the question regarding the diagnosis and the clinical observations that support it. It maintains a clinical focus throughout."
