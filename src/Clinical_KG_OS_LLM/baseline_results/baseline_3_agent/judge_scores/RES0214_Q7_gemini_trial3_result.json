  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer mostly matches the Gold Answer, but it contains one factual discrepancy regarding the sequence of symptoms. It states that the sore throat developed 'subsequently' to the fever. However, in the transcript [P-1], the patient lists the sore throat alongside the stuffy nose as occurring 'just before' the fever. The Gold Answer correctly identifies the sore throat as being present around the onset of the fever rather than after it.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key points: the initial stuffy nose, the three-day fever, the sore throat, the muscle aches (though it misses the specific '2-3 days' duration for muscle aches mentioned in [P-14]), and the comparison to the husband's one-week timeline. It captures the essential chronological elements requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is grounded in the transcript. The claim that the sore throat was 'subsequent' is a slight misinterpretation of the phrasing in [P-1], where the patient groups the stuffy nose and sore throat together as preceding the fever. Otherwise, the citations and descriptions of symptoms are faithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant. it follows the chronological structure requested by the prompt and includes a dedicated section comparing the patient's timeline to her husband's, directly addressing all parts of the question."
