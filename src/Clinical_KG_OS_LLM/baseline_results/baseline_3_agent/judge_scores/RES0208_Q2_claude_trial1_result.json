  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies both medications (Avodart and Tums) and their respective conditions (prostate enlargement/BPH and reflux). It accurately describes the medication change - that the patient stopped a previous reflux medication after figuring out which foods helped. All core facts align with the Gold Answer, though terminology varies slightly (e.g., 'prostate enlargement' vs. 'enlarged prostate').",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three main components requested: (1) current medications with conditions, (2) the change made to reflux medication, and (3) the reason for the change. However, it omits several details present in the Gold Answer: the specific citation that Avodart is for BPH with clarification it's not cancer, the 'here and there' as-needed nature of Tums use, the doctor's positive response ('Great, that's great'), and the mention that the patient denied allergies. These omissions represent approximately 20-25% of the Gold Answer's detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The medication names, conditions, and reason for stopping previous medication are all accurately cited with appropriate [P-#] references. The answer mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the source transcript, suggesting potential external reference materials, but this doesn't constitute hallucination as the claims themselves are transcript-grounded. No fabricated information is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: current medications, their prescribed conditions, and the change to reflux medication with reasoning. The structure explicitly labels each component, making it highly focused. The brief mention of the knowledge graph is tangential but minimal. Overall, the response stays on-topic throughout."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies all current medications (Avodart for prostate enlargement, Tums for reflux) and correctly describes the patient's independent discontinuation of a previous reflux medication after discovering dietary management strategies. All information is factually consistent with the transcript and properly cited. While the answer covers all requested components, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the as-needed nature of Tums use, the clarification that prostate enlargement is benign, the doctor's positive response, and the allergy denial. Despite these minor omissions, the response remains highly accurate, well-grounded, and directly relevant to the question."
