  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly focuses on reported positive symptoms (SOB, dry cough, fever) as 'screened for' rather than the denied symptoms listed in the Gold Answer (e.g., chest pain, feeling faint, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea, sputum production, prior episodes). It misrepresents patient denials (e.g., claiming denial of frequent seizures, which is minor and irrelevant) and infers DDs from positive findings instead of negative ones addressing cardiac, infectious, and GI categories as in Gold. This results in significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include specific denied symptoms/exposures grouped by DD categories (cardiac: chest pain, faint; infectious: taste/smell loss, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel; GI: nausea/vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea; plus dry cough, no prior SOB) with citations and note on implied DDs. Generated covers none of these denied items accurately, mentions dry cough but as positive, ignores exposures and most symptoms, and misses DD pattern from negatives; covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites transcript accurately for positives (P-1, P-4, P-5) and partial seizure denial (P-9), but hallucinates specific DDs like pneumonia, bronchitis, pulmonary edema, PE (stroke risk from epilepsy), and GERD aspiration, none verifiable in transcript. Inferences like infectious from fever/SOB plausible but not grounded as addressing negatives; multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated attempts structure addressing symptoms screened, denials, and DDs by category but uses positive symptoms instead of denied ones, irrelevant denial (seizure frequency), and DDs from positives not negatives, making it largely off-topic from question's focus on denied screenings and their DD implications."
