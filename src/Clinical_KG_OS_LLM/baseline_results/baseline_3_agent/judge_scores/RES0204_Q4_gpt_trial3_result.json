  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered due to grandparents’ history and ruled out. It accurately reports the mother’s cited negatives: no shortness of breath and no wheezing, including that these do not occur even with physical activity (matches P-28). No statements conflict with the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core required elements for the question: asthma + the specific negated symptoms (shortness of breath, wheeze), including absence during physical activity. However, it omits additional supporting details present in the Gold Answer, especially that the child had already “been worked up for that” (prior evaluation) and the broader context that he’s been healthy otherwise/has not had this kind of cough before (P-24).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (P-28). It does not introduce extraneous or invented clinical findings. Minor omission of other transcript elements does not affect faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the asked condition and the specific mother-cited findings (including the exercise-related negatives), with no irrelevant content."
