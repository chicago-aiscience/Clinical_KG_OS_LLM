  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the working diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold), and that a COVID swab is ordered with results in ~48 hours, plus isolation guidance while awaiting results. Minor inaccuracies/omissions relative to the Gold Answer include not explicitly noting the swab is done “today,” and not including the doctor’s expectation-setting that symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve and that the patient will receive further instructions from public health after results. These are omissions rather than contradictions, so overall facts presented are correct but not fully complete.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: diagnosis (viral/common cold), supportive care (hydration; OTC Tylenol Cold), COVID swab ordered, results in 48 hours, isolate at home/avoid others while awaiting results. Missing elements: (1) symptom duration expectation (“takes a few weeks”), (2) explicit statement that there’s not much beyond supportive care, (3) that the swab is done “today,” and (4) “further instructions from public health” after results. Overall coverage is substantial but not 100%.",
    "faithfulness": "All included recommendations and facts are grounded in [D-39]. The phrasing “confirm or rule out COVID-19” is a reasonable restatement of ordering a swab due to symptom overlap and the pandemic; no clear hallucinations or additions beyond what is supported.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, and public health guidance. No notable irrelevant content."
