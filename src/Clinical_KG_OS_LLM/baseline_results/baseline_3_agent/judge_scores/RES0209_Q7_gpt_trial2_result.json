  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly notes key current symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) and typical triggers (exercise, cold air, possible spring/pollen). However, it contains a clear factual/citation error: it attributes chest tightness confirmation to [P-4] (“Yeah”), but [P-4] is about using the bronchodilator as needed; chest tightness is confirmed at [P-20] (“Yes”). It also states symptoms have been present “over the past week” without acknowledging the later clarification to “last two weeks,” which is a discrepancy relative to the Gold Answer’s timeline framing. It implies the current exacerbation is “triggered by external factors,” which is not established as the cause of this specific 2-week worsening in the transcript (triggers are described generally).",
    "completeness": "Missing major required elements from the Gold Answer: (1) diagnosis at age 8 and current age 10 (2-year history); (2) baseline bronchodilator frequency of “once every two weeks”; (3) current frequency quantified as “almost every day… five six times a week”; (4) explicit temporal progression emphasizing the last two weeks; (5) key nuance that wheezing occurs more often than bronchodilator use (uses only when very hard to breathe); (6) nighttime symptom frequency (every other day/every two days); and (7) lack of infectious precipitant (screened/denied). It includes some triggers and current symptoms but does not answer the full “evolution over time” as asked.",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not grounded in the transcript: labeling the condition as a definite “diagnosis of asthma exacerbation” and referencing a “[Knowledge Graph] inference” are not supported by the provided dialogue. It also mis-cites chest tightness ([P-4] instead of [P-20]). The causal phrasing that the current exacerbation “is triggered by external factors” goes beyond what the transcript establishes for this episode.",
    "relevance": "Partially addresses the question by discussing symptom worsening and increased bronchodilator use, but it fails to provide the key requested timeline and frequency changes (baseline once/2 weeks to current 5–6 times/week over 2 weeks). It adds minor tangents (family history, knowledge graph statement) and does not directly narrate the evolution from age 8 diagnosis through baseline to current exacerbation as the prompt requests."
