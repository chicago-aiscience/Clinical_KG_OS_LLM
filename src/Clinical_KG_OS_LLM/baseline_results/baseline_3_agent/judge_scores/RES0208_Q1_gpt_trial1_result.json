  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies weakness [P-2], generalized achiness [P-20], loss of taste [P-4], subjective fever/feeling hot [P-4], and decreased appetite/reduced intake [P-2, P-4]. However, it incorrectly claims the patient “explicitly stated, ‘sore throat and cough’” at [P-1]; the patient did not mention cough or sore throat in [P-1] (those arise later at [P-7]–[P-9]). It also omits key symptoms present in the Gold Answer (diminished smell, headache context, denial of congestion), reducing overall factual alignment.",
    "completeness": "Covers: loss of taste, weakness, generalized achiness, subjective fever, decreased appetite. Misses: diminished sense of smell [P-6], early/minimal dry cough description and timing [P-7, P-8] (it lists cough but without the key nuance and with wrong citation), mild sore throat onset nuance [P-9] (also wrong citation), explicit denial of runny nose/congestion [P-10], and mild headache with “not more than usual”/stress-type context [P-11–P-13]. Overall this is roughly ~50–70% of the Gold Answer content.",
    "faithfulness": "Most symptoms listed are supported by the transcript, but there is a clear citation/attribution error: cough and sore throat are not stated in [P-1]. The phrasing implies a direct quote from the patient at that location, which is not verifiable. No major new (non-transcript) symptoms are invented, but the mis-citation and misquotation reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on “other symptoms” beyond shortness of breath and fatigue and organizes them by the requested domains (sensory, URI, musculoskeletal, constitutional). No major irrelevant tangents."
