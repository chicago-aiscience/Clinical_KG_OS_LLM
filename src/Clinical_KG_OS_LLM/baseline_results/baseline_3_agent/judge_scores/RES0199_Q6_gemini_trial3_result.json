  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer in all clinical details, including the specific test (COVID swab), the result timeline (24-48 hours), the isolation period (14 days), and the specific conditions for contact tracing.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key points requested in the prompt: diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, and all five supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics, and pain relief). It omits the doctor's mention of an alternative diagnosis (viral illness) which was in the Gold Answer, but this was not specifically requested by the prompt's list of requirements.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It uses direct citations from [D-52] and even retains the transcript's phonetic misspelling of 'NSAIDs' as 'anseads', showing it is strictly grounded in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, structured to address each specific part of the multi-part question without unnecessary filler or tangents."
