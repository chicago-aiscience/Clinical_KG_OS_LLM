  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the father's heart attack in his 50s, the current smoking rate of 5 cigarettes a day, and the stress of the Master's thesis. However, it uses masculine pronouns ('he/him') whereas the Gold Answer uses feminine pronouns ('she/her'). It also omits the specific detail that the patient started smoking at age 18 and previously smoked 10 cigarettes per day.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: the paternal grandfather's accidental death (which limits family history knowledge), the fact that the patient lives alone, her recent nervousness about running, and her history of teenage anxiety attacks which she fears are returning.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates references to a 'Knowledge Graph' and specific triple-style citations (e.g., '[smoke --[RISK_FACTOR]--> chest pain]') that are not present in the source transcript. While the transcript citations [P-x] are accurate, the external 'Knowledge Graph' framing is an architectural hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the prompt's request to explain how history, smoking, and stress contribute to and interact with the patient's concern about heart disease."
