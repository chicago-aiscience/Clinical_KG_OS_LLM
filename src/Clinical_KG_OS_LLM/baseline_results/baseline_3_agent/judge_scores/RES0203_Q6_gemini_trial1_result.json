{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the clinical assessment (COVID-19 symptoms), the specific test and method (swab), the timeline (1-2 days), and the isolation instructions. However, it is factually incorrect in stating that the transcript does not mention a plan to consult a supervising physician or additional tests; these are explicitly mentioned in transcript segment [D-40].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers four out of the six specific requirements from the prompt. It misses the mention of 'additional tests or follow-up' and the 'plan to consult with a supervising physician', both of which are present in the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates an absence of information. It claims that the transcript does not contain details about a supervising physician or additional tests, whereas [D-40] clearly states: 'we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today' and 'there might be a couple other tests we want to do'.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure, addressing most parts of the question directly, though it fails to extract the final two pieces of information requested."
