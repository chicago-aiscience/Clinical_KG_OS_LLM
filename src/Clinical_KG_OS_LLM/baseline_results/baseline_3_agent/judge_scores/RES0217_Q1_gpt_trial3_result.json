  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Local symptoms: The Generated Answer correctly captures key local symptoms at the bite site—redness, tenderness, and soreness localized to the skin rather than the joint—consistent with [P-1], [P-3], and [P-6]. However, it omits other specific details present in the Gold Answer (e.g., that the tick was “stuck pretty good” and the precise location in the crease behind the knee, and explicit denial of a bullseye/target rash). \nSystemic symptoms: The Generated Answer is factually incorrect in claiming the doctor did not screen for joint pain, fever/feeling ill, or headaches. The transcript explicitly includes screening for joint pain [D-7] with denial [P-7], fever/feeling ill [D-8] with denial [P-8], and headaches [D-19] with denial [P-19, P-20]. This is a major contradiction of both transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It covers some, but not all, of the Gold Answer’s local symptom details (misses “stuck pretty good,” the crease/where it bends detail, and the explicit denial of bullseye/target rash as a named finding). It fails to report the systemic screening items the question explicitly asks for (fever, joint pain, headaches) and their denials, which are central to the Gold Answer. Overall, it captures less than half of the required key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in (and directly contradict) the transcript—most notably the claim that the doctor did not screen for fever, joint pain, or headaches. Those screenings and denials are clearly present [D-7/P-7], [D-8/P-8], [D-19/P-19,P-20]. While the local symptom statements are grounded, the systemic portion contains multiple unfaithful claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address exactly what was asked (local symptoms at the bite site and systemic symptoms screened/denied). Aside from a minor unnecessary phrase (“knowledge graph”), it stays on-topic. However, it becomes unhelpful by asserting the key systemic symptoms were not screened, which undermines usefulness despite topical focus."

  "summary": "The answer is partially correct for local bite-site symptoms but contains major, transcript-contradicting errors about systemic symptom screening (fever, joint pain, headaches), leading to low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness despite being mostly on-topic."
