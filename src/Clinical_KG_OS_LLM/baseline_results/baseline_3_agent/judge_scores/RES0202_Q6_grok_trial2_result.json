  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. All details on the COVID swab, turnaround time, isolation, false negatives, alternative diagnosis (another viral illness/infection), and warning signs match precisely without errors or contradictions. Minor omissions (e.g., explicit assessment phrasing, asthma differential, no medications) do not introduce inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab and 24-48 hr TAT (100%), 14-day isolation incl. sister (100%), false negatives (100%), alternative diagnosis if negative (another viral illness/infection, 100%), warning signs with examples (100%). Missed: explicit assessment as 'viral infectious process consistent with COVID' [D-44,D-45], asthma differential note [D-45], no medications/watchful waiting. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: COVID swab/TAT/isolation/false neg/alt dx/warnings all from [D-44]; 'infection' from [D-45]. No hallucinations, unverifiable details, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the specified elements (test/TAT, isolation, alt dx/false neg, warning signs) within the complete plan; no off-topic content or tangents."
