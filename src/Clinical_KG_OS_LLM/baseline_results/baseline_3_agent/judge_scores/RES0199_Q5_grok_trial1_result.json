  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately cites transcript sections [D-45/P-45 for living situation and apartment details, D-46/P-46 for environmental triggers, D-47/P-47 for sick contacts mentioning possible work lunchroom exposure, D-48/P-48 and D-50/P-50 for workplace at car dealership and sick colleagues, D-49/P-49 for travel history], confirming systematic exploration post [P-38]. Generated Answer incorrectly states these were 'not systematically explored' and lists each as 'Not explored' except partially sick contacts via contact tracing [D-52], which Gold does not emphasize as the exploration method. This introduces major factual contradictions on all core elements versus Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: timing after [P-38], living details [P-45] and triggers [D-46/P-46], sick contacts [D-47/P-47], workplace [P-48/D-50/P-50], travel [D-49/P-49], substance screening, no clear source. Generated covers 0% of these, instead negating exploration and focusing on COVID plan/contact tracing, missing all specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript directly supports Gold with explicit doctor questions [D-45 to D-50] on living, exposures, work, travel, sick contacts; patient responses detailed. Generated hallucinates absence ('Not explored') despite verbatim evidence; misrepresents [D-52] contact tracing mention as primary sick contact inquiry, not systematic exploration; largely fabricated negation.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses question by listing exact categories (living, workplace, travel, sick contacts) and assessing exploration, with focused structure and no off-topic digressions beyond brief COVID context."
