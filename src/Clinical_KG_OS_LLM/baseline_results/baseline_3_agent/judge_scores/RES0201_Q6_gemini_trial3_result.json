  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the doctor's assessment (COVID-19 symptoms), the planned tests (swab and X-ray), and the isolation protocols (until results, and potentially after if symptomatic despite a negative result), matching the facts in the gold answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points: assessment, both diagnostic tests, and both stages of isolation instructions. It omits the gold answer's detail about the doctor consulting with a supervising physician and the specific mention of the patient's COPD as context for the chest X-ray.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript, particularly section [D-43], and use accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses every part of the user's question without including extraneous information."
