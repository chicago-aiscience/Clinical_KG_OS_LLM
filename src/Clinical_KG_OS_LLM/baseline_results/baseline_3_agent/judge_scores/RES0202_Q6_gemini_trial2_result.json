  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's information regarding the diagnostic test (COVID swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours), isolation period (14 days), alternative diagnosis for a negative result (another viral illness), and emergency warning signs (fever, neurological symptoms/seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers nearly all key points. However, it misses one specific detail included in the Gold Answer and transcript [D-45]: the doctor's note that asthma would have been a differential diagnosis if the child did not have a fever. The Gold Answer includes this as part of the 'complete assessment'.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited (D-44, D-45). No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses all specific components of the multi-part question, including assessment, management, testing, isolation, and warning signs."
