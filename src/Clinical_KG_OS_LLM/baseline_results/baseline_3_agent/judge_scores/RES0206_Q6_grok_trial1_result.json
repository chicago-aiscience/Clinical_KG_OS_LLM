  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main elements of the doctor's plan from [D-43], including physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab, labs, consultation with attending, decision criteria based on labs and vitals, and returning to discuss. However, it omits the preliminary clinical impression of COPD exacerbation triggered by infection, the specific mention of temperature check (cross-referenced from earlier), and the patient's agreement. These are minor omissions relative to the core plan, so factual accuracy is high with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam (vitals/chest listen), COVID swab and labs, consultation with attending, decision criteria (labs/vitals for admission vs discharge), patient communication (return to discuss). Missed: preliminary impression (COPD exacerbation + infection), specific temperature check context, patient's agreement. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-43]: physical exam/vitals/chest, COVID swab, labs/vitals for decision, consult attending, return to patient. Citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly focused on the doctor's comprehensive plan, structured as a bullet list directly addressing examinations (physical/vitals/chest), tests (COVID swab/labs), consultations (attending), criteria (labs/vitals for ER admission vs discharge), with no off-topic content."
