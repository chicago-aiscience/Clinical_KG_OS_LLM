  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key factual elements from D-37: physical exam components (heart and lungs auscultation, quick physical exam) and the collaborative process (consult with supervising doctor, review findings, return to discuss next steps). All facts align with the Gold Answer without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the core components from D-37 but lacks the contextual richness of the Gold Answer. Missing elements include: the foreshadowing from D-1, the patient's agreement (P-37), the explicit mention that this is a collaborative/supervisory structure, and the notable absence of diagnosis/medication at this stage. Covers approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in D-37. The citation [D-37] is accurate, and the quoted phrase 'quick listen to your heart and lungs' is verbatim from the transcript. No hallucinated content detected.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three components of the question: stated plan at end of consultation, physical examination components, and the process for determining next steps. No irrelevant content included. Perfectly focused on what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate and highly relevant information that directly addresses the question with proper citation. All claims are grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations. However, it lacks the comprehensive contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the connection to D-1, patient agreement, supervisory structure clarification, and the notable absence of diagnosis/medication. The answer is correct and focused but somewhat abbreviated compared to the fuller clinical picture provided in the Gold Answer."
