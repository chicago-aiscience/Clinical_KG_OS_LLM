  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the management plan stated in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs; chest X-ray; oxygen saturation measurement with supplemental oxygen as needed; continuation of bronchodilators; addition of steroids and antibiotics; and ordering a COVID swab. No contradictory or clinically incorrect elements were added. Minor issue: it groups the COVID swab under “Monitoring” rather than as a test, but the action itself is correctly captured.",
    "completeness": "Relative to the Gold Answer, it includes all core COPD-exacerbation elements from [D-52] (labs, imaging, O2 sat monitoring, COVID swab, oxygen, steroids, antibiotics, bronchodilators). It omits two details included in the Gold Answer: (1) expected COVID swab turnaround (24–48 hours) and (2) the additional note from [D-37] about ongoing blood pressure monitoring/kidney complication caution. Therefore, coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All stated items are directly supported by the transcript: the listed labs, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation measurement/oxygen if needed, COVID swab, continued bronchodilators, and new steroids/antibiotics are all in [D-52]. The mention that the patient’s bronchodilators are Ventolin and Spiriva is supported by [P-11]. No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the doctor’s COPD exacerbation management plan and specifically addresses labs, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions (steroids, antibiotics, oxygen, bronchodilators). No meaningful tangents."
