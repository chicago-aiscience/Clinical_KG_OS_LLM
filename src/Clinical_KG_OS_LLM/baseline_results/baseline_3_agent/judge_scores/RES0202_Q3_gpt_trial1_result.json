  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the same key symptom combination as the Gold Answer: dry cough worsening over ~3 days, measured fever just over 100°F (100.1–101°F), and possible loss of taste. It also correctly reflects the clinician’s reasoning that these symptoms were consistent with COVID-19 (leading to swab testing/isolation advice) and that the presence of fever made an infectious process more likely than non-infectious causes such as asthma (as stated in D-45). No material factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core triad (cough, fever with specific range, taste change) and the doctor’s collective interpretation (COVID-aligned symptoms → test/isolate; fever shifts thinking away from asthma toward infection). Compared with the Gold Answer, it is slightly less complete in not explicitly incorporating other supportive systemic features mentioned in the Gold Answer (e.g., fatigue/acute systemic involvement framing), though it does mention appetite loss. Overall, it captures the main required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are well-grounded in the transcript with appropriate references: dry cough and progression (P-1, P-5, P-12), fever values (P-1, P-2), taste concern (P-17), COVID alignment and testing/isolation (D-44), and fever distinguishing infection vs asthma consideration (D-45). Minor wording issues (e.g., ‘patient reported’) do not introduce new facts. No meaningful hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by specifying the symptom combination (respiratory complaint, temperature, taste change) and explaining how the doctor used these together to conclude COVID-19 was plausible and that an infectious process was most likely. No significant tangents."
