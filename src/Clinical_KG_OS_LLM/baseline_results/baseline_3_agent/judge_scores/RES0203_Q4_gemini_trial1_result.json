  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect regarding the content of the transcript. It claims that negative findings for symptoms like fever, dyspnea, and sore throat are not present in the text, whereas the transcript explicitly records the patient denying these symptoms in turns [P-10] through [P-15] and [P-22]. It also incorrectly states that the patient's responses regarding immunizations and family history are missing, but they are found in [P-20] and [P-27].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to list the negative findings from the review of systems as requested. It misses almost 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer, including the specific symptoms confirmed absent (fever, dyspnea, headaches, sore throat, chills, muscle aches, chest pain, etc.) and the explanation of how their absence informed the clinical picture.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a high degree of 'negative hallucination' by asserting that information is absent from the source text when it is clearly provided. It misrepresents the transcript by stating that confirmations of absence are not visible.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is mostly irrelevant as it fails to answer the specific question asked. Instead of listing negative findings and explaining their significance, it focuses on positive symptoms and claims the requested information does not exist."
