  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the COVID swab test with 24-48 hour results [D-44], 14-day isolation including from the younger sister [D-44], and ER precautions for high fever, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness, dizziness, or fainting [D-44], all consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly notes symptoms align with COVID [D-44] and adds the asthma consideration from [D-45], which is factually grounded though not emphasized in Gold as direct management. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: COVID swab test and timeline (yes), isolation for 14 days specifically from younger sister (yes), ER precautions (yes). Partially covers household context via sister mention but misses explicit parents [P-35]. Misses false-negative possibility and other viral illness [D-44], no medications/supportive care/wait for results [D-44], mother's acknowledgment of viral care [P-41], and school test requirement [P-41]. Covers ~80% of Gold's key management points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: test/isolation/sister/ER symptoms from [D-44], asthma differential from [D-45]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details; phrasing like 'household restrictions' and 'safety netting' interpretive but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by detailing diagnostic test (COVID swab), isolation instructions (14 days) and duration, specific isolation from younger sister, plus relevant management like ER advice; minor asthma note is on-topic as differential."
