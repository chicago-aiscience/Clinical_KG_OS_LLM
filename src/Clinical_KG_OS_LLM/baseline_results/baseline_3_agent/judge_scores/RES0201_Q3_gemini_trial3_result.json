  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it claims the patient reported a loss of smell (anosmia), whereas the transcript [P-19] explicitly states 'maybe taste a little bit but not smell.' It also misses critical symptoms like difficulty breathing and muscle aches that the Gold Answer identifies as part of the clinical reasoning.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including the patient's difficulty breathing (a major COVID-19 indicator mentioned in the transcript), muscle aches, and the context of potential exposure at grocery stores/banks. It focuses heavily on dysphagia which is less central to the doctor's reasoning than the respiratory and sensory symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly here. It hallucinates that the patient reported a loss of smell and references a 'Knowledge Graph' that is not part of the provided transcript or context. It also misattributes the inclusion of 'inability to smell' to the doctor's assessment in [D-43].",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks how 'reduced taste without loss of smell' supports the reasoning. The Generated Answer fails to address this, instead incorrectly asserting that there was a loss of smell, thereby failing to answer the specific premise of the prompt."
