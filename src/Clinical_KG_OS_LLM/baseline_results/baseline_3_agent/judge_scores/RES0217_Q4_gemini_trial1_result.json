  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the features it mentions. However, it incorrectly cites [D-6] for blood work/serology, whereas the transcript mentions blood work only in [D-18]. The identification of the bullseye rash as the primary feature is correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete. While it identifies the bullseye rash, it fails to mention other specific clinical features the doctor assessed for and found absent: joint pain [D-7], fever or systemic illness [D-8], other bites [D-9], and headaches [D-19]. It covers most proposed tests but misses the mention of consulting a supervising physician as part of the evaluation process.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made are grounded in the transcript. The distinction between the current localized symptoms (redness, tenderness) and the absent bullseye rash is well-supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question, though with limited detail on the clinical features side."
