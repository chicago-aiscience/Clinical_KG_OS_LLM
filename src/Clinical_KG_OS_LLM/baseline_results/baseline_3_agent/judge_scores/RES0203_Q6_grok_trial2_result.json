  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the assessment as symptoms consistent with COVID-19 [D-39], the COVID swab test [D-39], timeline [D-39], and self-isolation details [D-39], matching Gold. However, it omits that the patient is otherwise generally well [D-16, P-16] and incorrectly claims no mention of additional tests or supervising physician consultation, directly contradicting [D-40] where the doctor says 'there might be a couple other tests we want to do' and 'we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today.' This introduces significant factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) symptoms consistent with COVID [D-39]; (2) patient otherwise generally well [D-16]; (3) COVID test via swab [D-39]; (4) self-isolation until results and potentially longer if negative but symptomatic [D-39]; (5) timeline 1-2 days [D-39]; (6) mention of possible additional tests [D-40]; (7) plan to consult supervising physician [D-40]; (8) possible more questions [D-40]; (9) reassurance [D-41]. Generated covers (1 partial), (3), (4), (5); misses (2), (6), (7), (8), (9) and incorrectly denies (6)-(7). Covers ~40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about assessment, test (swab), timeline, self-isolation are verifiable in [D-39] with accurate citations. However, the statement 'do not mention a plan to consult with a supervising physician or order any additional tests' is a fabrication, as [D-40] explicitly mentions both 'couple other tests' and consulting 'the doctor that I'm working with today.' This is a hallucinated denial of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question's elements (assessment, tests with method, self-care, timeline, additional tests/follow-up, supervising consult) with headings matching them, despite errors; no off-topic content."
