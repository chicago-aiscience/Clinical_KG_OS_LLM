    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately quotes and paraphrases the doctor's assessment from [D-43] matching the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the two diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray) directly from [D-43]. Isolation instructions and the condition for continued isolation (symptoms persisting even if test negative) are precisely stated from [D-43], with no factual errors or contradictions to the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: assessment ('in line with common symptoms of covid 19' [D-43]), diagnostic tests (covid swab and chest xray [D-43]), isolation until results and continued if symptomatic even if negative [D-43]. Missed: explicit reasons for chest X-ray (difficulty breathing [P-8,P-9,P-10], COPD [P-27]), 'heads up' framing, consulting supervising physician [D-1,D-44], patient acknowledgment [P-43,P-44]. Covers core ~85% of key points.",

    "relevance": "Perfectly structured (Assessment, Tests, Isolation) to directly address the question on assessment, plan, tests, isolation instructions, and conditions for continued isolation; no off-topic content."
