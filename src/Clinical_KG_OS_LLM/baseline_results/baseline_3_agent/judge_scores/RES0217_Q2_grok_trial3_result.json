  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the patient's current statin therapy for cholesterol and the proposal for prophylactic antibiotics due to potential >72-hour tick attachment, consistent with Gold. It correctly notes no specific antibiotic details and includes insecticide suggestion. Minor discrepancies include inaccurate citations (e.g., [D-5] misused for prophylactic discussion which is in [D-6]), introduction of external '[KG]' knowledge not in Gold or transcript, and addition of diagnostics (tick ID, blood work, physical exam) which align but are not emphasized as core meds in Gold. No major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: current statin/cholesterol management [P-14,15], no allergies [P-16,17], past tick bite antibiotics [P-3], new prophylactic antibiotics details/rationale/no specifics/physician consult [D-6,13,18,22], insecticide [D-18]. Covered: statin, prophylactic antibiotics, insecticide, diagnostics (tick lab/blood/physical partially in Gold plans). Missed: explicit cholesterol management phrasing, allergies denial, past treatment history, physician consultation detail. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about statin [P-14,15], prophylactic antibiotics [D-6,13,18], tick lab/blood/physical/insecticide [D-18,6] verifiable in transcript. Citation errors ([D-5] incorrect for prophylaxis/tick ID), hallucinated '[KG]' reference not in transcript. Diagnostics plausible and grounded but citations partially inaccurate. Some unverifiable details but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question on medications (statin, prophylactic antibiotics) and treatments discussed (diagnostics, insecticide), focused on consultation content with no major off-topic digressions."
