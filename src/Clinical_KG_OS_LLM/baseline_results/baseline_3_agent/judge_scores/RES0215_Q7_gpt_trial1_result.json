  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple factual errors versus the Gold Answer. (1) It states the wheezing “initially began without a reported acute trigger,” but the transcript clearly links onset to exertion (playing tag and becoming quite out of breath) [P-3]. (2) It claims the transcript does not explicitly detail a nocturnal event, but the parent explicitly reports one night with wheeziness that resolved on its own and caused trouble falling asleep [P-43, P-44]. (3) It frames symptoms as a “progression in severity of dyspnea,” whereas the transcript emphasizes a fluctuating/episodic pattern that resolves with rest and recurs with activity [P-5, P-6], not a steady worsening. Some elements are correct (4–5 day duration [P-1], cough present at presentation [P-1], exertion and cold worsening [P-3, P-38]).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements that are missing or inadequately captured: (1) the core fluctuating/episodic pattern—episodes recur with activity and resolve with rest [P-5, P-6] (only vaguely stated as “fluctuate,” without the defining rest/activity cycle); (2) that cough emerged after wheeze/breathlessness and is non-productive/no phlegm [P-1, P-31] (non-productive not mentioned); (3) the nocturnal episode details (one night, wheezy, resolved spontaneously, trouble falling asleep) [P-43, P-44] (incorrectly denied); (4) pertinent negatives in the Gold Answer (no fever [P-7], no cyanosis [P-32], fine otherwise between attacks [P-9]). It also adds non-essential background (past viral infections) not part of the asked symptom-development narrative.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or directly contradicted by the transcript: (1) “began without a reported acute trigger” contradicts [P-3]; (2) “transcript does not explicitly detail…at night” contradicts [P-43, P-44]; (3) “progression in the severity” is an interpretive claim not supported given the described episodic course [P-5, P-6]. The mention of “knowledge graph” is extraneous and not transcript-based. Other points (cold weather worse [P-38], seasonal allergies/Reactine [P-35, P-36]) are grounded but not central to the question.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at symptom development (onset timing, triggers, cough), but it includes tangential content (prior viral infections, allergy management) and mishandles a key asked component (the nocturnal episode). Overall it is only partially aligned with the question’s requested narrative (trigger → fluctuating episodes → cough emergence → single nocturnal episode)."
