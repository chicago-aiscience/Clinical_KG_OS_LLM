  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies several symptoms: sore throat, cough, weakness, muscle aches, loss of taste, fever/hotness, and loss of appetite. However, it incorrectly attributes the sore throat and cough to the first patient turn [P-1] and includes a fabricated quote ('sore throat and cough') that does not appear in that turn or anywhere in the transcript as a single phrase from the patient. The Gold Answer correctly notes that these were only starting or minimal, whereas the generated answer overstates them.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer and the prompt's specific requests. Most notably, it misses the 'sense of smell' which was explicitly asked for under sensory changes. It also omits the patient's headaches and the relevant negative finding regarding the absence of a runny nose or congestion, both of which are present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a specific quote ('sore throat and cough') and attributes it to [P-1]. In the transcript, [P-1] only mentions shortness of breath, being rundown, and fatigue. While the patient later acknowledges these symptoms in [P-8] and [P-9], the specific string cited as an 'explicit statement' is not grounded in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the structure suggested by the prompt, categorizing findings into the requested domains."
