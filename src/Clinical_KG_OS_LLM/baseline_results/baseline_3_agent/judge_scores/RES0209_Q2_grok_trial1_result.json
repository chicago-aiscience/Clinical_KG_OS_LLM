  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the bronchodilator as the patient's asthma medication, matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that administration method is unspecified (contradicting Gold's 'puffer' from P-7/D-7 and transcript). It fundamentally errs by claiming no evidence of doctor asking about daily controller medication, directly contradicting Gold and transcript (D-5: 'one that you take every day no matter what', P-5 denial). Significant contradictions on key facts warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) sole med bronchodilator/rescue as-needed (D-4/P-4/D-6); (2) administered via puffer (P-7/D-7); (3) doctor asked about daily controller ('every day no matter what', D-5), patient lacks it (P-5). Generated covers only (1) partially (~bronchodilator name from P-1), misses administration entirely, misses entire daily controller inquiry. Covers ~25% of key points. Score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: bronchodilator in P-1 (accurate). Unverifiable/incorrect: administration unspecified (hallucination, ignores P-7 'puffer'); no doctor inquiry on controller (hallucination, ignores D-5 explicitly); wrong citations (D-20 irrelevant chest tightness, not medication). Multiple hallucinations of absence/omissions. Score 2.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response directly mirroring question's three parts (current med, administration, daily controller), with no off-topic content or tangents. Perfectly focused despite inaccuracies. Score 5."
