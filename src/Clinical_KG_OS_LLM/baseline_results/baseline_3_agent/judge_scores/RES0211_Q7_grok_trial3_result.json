  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the initial symptom sequence (scratchy throat followed by dry cough) as stated in [P-4], matching the Gold Answer. It correctly describes the feeling of heat as concurrent and constant during the illness, without specifying a precise onset relative to throat/cough, aligning with Gold's note on no exact timing and part of the same multi-day illness. Inclusion of doctor's summary as 'little bit of fever' is factual [D-58]. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: initial symptom order (throat then cough), feeling hot as persistent/constant and part of same illness without specific timing, doctor's fever summary. Missed: explicit mention of 3-4 day duration, additional symptoms in progression by visit (headache details [P-1/P-2], malaise [P-1/P-14], fatigue [P-13]), specific details like night sweats question/day-night persistence phrasing, wearing shorts/tank top [P-9], and overall progression from localized to systemic. Covers core question-focused points (80-99%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: throat-then-cough from [P-4]; feeling hot concurrent/constant from [P-1][P-7][P-9]; crappy/general state [P-1]; doctor's summary implied [D-58]. 'Shortly thereafter' is a minor plausible inference not contradicting transcript (no timing specified). Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by detailing symptom order starting from initial (throat -> cough) and precisely relating feeling hot as concurrent/not sequential to cough/throat, with no off-topic content."
