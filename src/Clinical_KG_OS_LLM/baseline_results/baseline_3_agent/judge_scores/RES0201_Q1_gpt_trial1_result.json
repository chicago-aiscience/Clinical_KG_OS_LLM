  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies sore throat starting ~4 days ago and difficulty swallowing food, and notes a taste change. However, it omits major reported symptoms from the gold answer/transcript (notably constant, worsening shortness of breath starting the day before; fatigue and muscle aches). It also incorrectly states that the transcript contains no explicit denials of cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, or fever—these are explicitly denied in the transcript (P-15 to P-18, P-23). Thus, there are significant factual errors relative to the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: sore throat; dysphagia; reduced taste; denial of loss of smell. Missed: dyspnea (onset, constant nature, worsening); fatigue/tiredness; muscle aches; denial of cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills/night sweats; and other negatives noted in gold (no sick contacts, no travel). Overall this captures well under half of the gold answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The included positive symptoms (sore throat, dysphagia, taste change) and denial of smell are grounded in cited transcript lines. But the statement that there were no explicit denials of cough/runny nose/fever/headache/chest pain directly contradicts the transcript, making the answer partially unfaithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on the asked topic (reported symptoms and explicitly denied screened symptoms), but it fails to supply most of the requested denied symptoms and adds an unnecessary caveat about the transcript not containing denials."
