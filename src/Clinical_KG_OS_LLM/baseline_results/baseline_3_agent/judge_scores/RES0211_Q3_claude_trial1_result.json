  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key symptoms and their relationship to URI diagnosis. It accurately references transcript locations and makes valid clinical connections. However, it introduces unexplained external concepts like 'Knowledge Graph' that aren't in the source material, and misquotes D-58 ('So you have been bringing anything up' vs actual 'you have been bringing anything up'). The core clinical reasoning is sound despite these issues.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of key points from the Gold Answer. It addresses the dry cough [P-4, P-5, P-6], scratchy throat [P-4], headache [P-1, P-2], and absence of sputum production [P-5, P-6]. It mentions the brother's cold [P-39] indirectly through 'household viral exposure.' However, it misses several important elements: subjective fever details [P-7, P-9], malaise [P-14, D-15], fatigue [P-13], absence of GI symptoms [P-11, P-12], absence of joint pain [P-13], and the 3-4 day timeline [P-1, P-3].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript but contains significant issues. It references actual exchanges (P-1, P-4, D-58) but introduces the unexplained concept of 'Knowledge Graph' which appears to be a hallucination or external framework not present in the transcript. The statement about D-58's summary is somewhat accurate but oversimplified. The claim that the doctor 'addresses this by asking' about sputum production conflates multiple exchanges (D-5, D-6) rather than citing them precisely. The core symptom descriptions are faithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses how Jessica's symptoms support the URI assessment, maintaining strong focus on the question. It systematically explains symptom correlation, differential diagnosis through absence of sputum, and exclusion of systemic involvement. However, it includes some structural elements ('1. Correlation with Known Clinical Indicators') that seem designed for a different format. The content remains predominantly relevant throughout with only minor organizational tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates solid clinical reasoning and addresses the core question adequately, correctly identifying key symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, absent sputum) and their relationship to URI diagnosis. However, it covers only about 60-70% of the Gold Answer's key points, notably missing subjective fever details, malaise, fatigue, timeline specifics, and explicit discussion of absent GI symptoms and joint pain. The answer contains faithfulness concerns including the unexplained 'Knowledge Graph' concept and minor citation inaccuracies, though core symptom descriptions remain grounded in the transcript. The response maintains strong relevance to the question despite some structural formatting that seems external to the clinical context."
