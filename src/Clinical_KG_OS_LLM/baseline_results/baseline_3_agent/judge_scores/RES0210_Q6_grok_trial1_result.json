  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain the doctor's plan, despite [D-43] explicitly stating the plan to consult the supervising physician and return; it misses key self-care (expectoration [P-13], resting [P-10]), most aggravating factors (deep breathing [P-18], exertion [P-10/P-11], coughing worsening chest pain [P-19]), and additional alleviating factors; it inaccurately attributes Tylenol to chest pain via a non-existent Knowledge Graph rather than fever [P-8/P-14]; and misrepresents coughing's effect as throat rawness [P-15] instead of worsening chest pain. Significant errors and omissions contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: Tylenol self-care and partial relief [P-14]; coughing as aggravating (but incorrectly as throat rawness, not chest pain). Missed entirely: doctor's plan [D-43]; expectoration self-care/relief [P-13]; resting self-care [P-10]; deep breathing aggravation [P-18]; exertion aggravation [P-10/P-11]; coughing worsening chest pain [P-19]; no other triggers [P-12]; clinical importance of pleuritic/exertional symptoms. Covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: Tylenol helps a little [P-14]; throat raw after coughing [P-15]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'Knowledge Graph' treating chest pain (no KG in transcript); no doctor's plan despite clear [D-43]; coughing exacerbating via throat rawness rather than chest pain worsening [P-19]; multiple additions/misses indicate hallucination and poor grounding.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer uses headings directly matching the three question components (doctor's plan, self-care, aggravating/alleviating factors), with content attempting to address them, though incomplete; minor tangent via Knowledge Graph reference but overall focused on query elements."
