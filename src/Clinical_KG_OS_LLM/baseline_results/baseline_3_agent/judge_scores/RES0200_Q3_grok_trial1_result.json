  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key symptoms (worsening cough, sputum changes to yellow, increased dyspnea/shortness of breath) matching the Gold Answer's three cardinal symptoms, correctly cites relevant transcript sections (P-1, P-6, D-52), and quotes the doctor's linking statement from D-52 verbatim. Minor discrepancies include less precise citations (e.g., Gold uses P-5 for cough details, P-8 for SOB specifics, P-2 for 5-year COPD history; Generated uses P-1 broadly) and omission of inhaler details [P-11] and sputum's infectious implication, but core facts align fully.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: worsening cough (yes, [P-1]), sputum change (yes, [P-6]), increased SOB (yes, [P-1/P-8]), COPD history (yes, [P-1]), doctor's synthesis in [D-52] (yes, quoted). Missed or less detailed: cough triggered by minimal exertion [P-5], SOB requiring sitting after short walks [P-8], exact 5-year COPD [P-2], inhalers [P-11], explicit infectious suggestion for sputum. Covers ~85-90% of elaborated points, focusing on the question's specified combination.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims (symptoms, history, doctor's quote) are directly verifiable in transcript [P-1, P-6, D-52]. Hallucinations include 'clinical documentation expert analysis' and 'Knowledge Graph' references (not in transcript, fabricated external support claiming symptoms 'indicate COPD exacerbation'), introducing unverifiable elements; symptom timelines and triad phrasing are plausible but slightly generalized.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by naming the exact symptom combination (worsening cough, sputum changes, increased dyspnea) with COPD history and detailing the doctor's explicit linkage via [D-52] quote; minor extraneous intro/outro phrases do not detract significantly."
