  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the symptoms (cough, sputum, blood, shortness of breath) and the 3-day timeline. It correctly identifies that the condition worsened.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to include the patient's explicit statement that this is 'the worst that I've had' [P-3], which is the most direct answer to the severity comparison. 2) It misses baseline details like rescue inhaler frequency and the specific decline in walking the dog. 3) It misses the distinction that while the patient had ER visits, she was never hospitalized overnight.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly faithful to the transcript but includes references to a 'knowledge graph' and tags like '[SYMPTOM]' which are not present in the source text, suggesting the use of external context or hallucinated structural elements.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the prompt, though its comparison of severity is less precise than the Gold Answer because it omits the patient's own qualitative ranking of the episode."
