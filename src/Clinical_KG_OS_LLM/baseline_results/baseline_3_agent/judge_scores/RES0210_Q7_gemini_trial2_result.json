  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies Sunday as the day of 'initial onset', whereas the transcript (P-3) and Gold Answer specify a raspy cough began on Friday, and a runny nose appeared a week prior (P-16). Additionally, it places the onset of chest pain on Wednesday, while the transcript 'especially notice over the last day' (P-20) as of Wednesday indicates it began on Tuesday.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer and the prompt's requirements: it omits the 'raspy cough' on Friday, the 'runny nose' from a week ago, the 'yellow' color of the sputum, and the 'exertional dyspnea' (feeling winded) reported in P-10 and P-11.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is generally grounded in the transcript, but by excluding the earlier symptoms (Friday and a week ago), it misrepresents the 'initial onset' mentioned in the text. However, it does not invent entirely false symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested timeline format, directly addressing the question about symptom progression."
