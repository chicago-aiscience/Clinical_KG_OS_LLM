  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes that the patient uses condoms for contraception [P-45] and that no medication/prescription for the current cough is mentioned as having been started during this visit (consistent with the transcript ending after history-taking and summary at [D-47]). However, it does not explicitly state the patient’s key medication-status statement that she is taking no medications right now [P-29], which is central to the question. No direct false medication claims are made.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include: (1) explicitly not taking any medications currently [P-29]; (2) eczema treatment with regular moisturizing creams currently [P-23]; (3) previously prescribed an eczema cream when severe (unspecified) [P-23]; (4) denies drug allergies/adverse reactions [P-28] and possible cat allergy without meds [P-27]; (5) condoms used, not on hormonal contraception [P-45]; (6) substance use (marijuana vape, alcohol) [P-36-37, P-41-42]; (7) no OTC cough remedies/inhalers/antibiotics reported. The Generated Answer only covers condoms and the lack of cough prescriptions; it misses most other medication/treatment history and the explicit current “no medications” statement.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements made are largely grounded in the transcript (condoms [P-45]; no mention of cough prescriptions). Minor issues: referencing a “knowledge graph” is not supported by the provided transcript, and “no prescription has been issued yet” is an inference rather than an explicit statement (though consistent with the encounter). No major hallucinated medications or treatments were added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on the topic of medications/treatments and current medication status, with no major tangents. It is relevant but too narrow relative to what was asked."
