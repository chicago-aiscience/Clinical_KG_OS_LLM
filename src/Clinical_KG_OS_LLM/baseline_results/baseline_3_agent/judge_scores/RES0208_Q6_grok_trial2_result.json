  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all factual elements of the Gold Answer, including the physical exam of the chest, chest X-ray and COVID swab as tests, self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate), 24-48 hour timeline, public health nurse follow-up if positive, and disposition based on test results. Minor discrepancies include categorizing physical exam under diagnostic tests (Gold separates it) and a citation error for chest X-ray (cites [D-36] instead of [D-37]), but core facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers 100% of Gold Answer key points: physical exam planned for chest/breathing ([D-37],[D-38]); tests (chest X-ray for chest infection, COVID swab [D-37]); self-isolation details and source (doctor [D-37], nurse if positive); timeline (24-48 hours [D-37]); criteria (test results determine admission/discharge, no thresholds [D-37]). No points missed.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript, primarily [D-37]: chest X-ray, COVID swab, physical exam, self-isolation (exact phrasing), timeline, nurse, and criteria all match verbatim or closely paraphrase [D-37]; [D-38] for proceeding to exam. Minor citation slip (chest X-ray in [D-37], not [D-36]) but no hallucinations or ungrounded content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around exact elements requested (tests, physical exam, self-isolation instructions/from whom, timeline, admission/discharge criteria), with no off-topic content."
