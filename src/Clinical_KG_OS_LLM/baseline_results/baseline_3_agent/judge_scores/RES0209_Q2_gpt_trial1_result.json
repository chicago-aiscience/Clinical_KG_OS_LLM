  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient uses a bronchodilator, but it is wrong on two central facts. (1) Administration is explicitly stated as a “puffer”/inhaler in the transcript (D-7/P-7), yet the answer claims administration is not specified. (2) The doctor explicitly asked about a medication taken “every day no matter what” (D-5), and the patient said they do not have it (P-5); the answer incorrectly states there is no evidence the doctor asked about a controller medication. These are major contradictions to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: identifies bronchodilator. Key elements missed: that it is used as-needed; that it is administered via a puffer/inhaler; that the clinician asked about a daily controller/maintenance medication and the patient does not have one; and the supporting denial of other medications. Overall, it captures only a minority of required points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are directly contradicted by the transcript (e.g., claiming no administration route specified despite D-7/P-7; claiming no controller-medication question despite D-5/P-5). While it does not add many new fabricated clinical facts, it misrepresents what is plainly present in the source, which substantially reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on the topic of asthma medications and attempts to answer all parts of the question, but it diverts to unrelated symptom/triggers references and ultimately fails to provide the requested controller-medication detail. Still, it is largely focused on the asked domains."
