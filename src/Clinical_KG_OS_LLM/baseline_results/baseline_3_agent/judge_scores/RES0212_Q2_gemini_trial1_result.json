  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct in its two main points: the use of condoms for contraception and the fact that no medications have been prescribed for the current cough symptoms during the visit. It aligns with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly incomplete. It misses the patient's entire history and current treatment for eczema (moisturizing creams currently, prescription creams in the past), which is the primary medical treatment mentioned. It also fails to mention the patient's explicit denial of taking any other medications, her possible cat allergy, and her use of substances (marijuana/vaping and alcohol), all of which are included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is directly supported by the transcript with correct citations. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but focuses narrowly on the current visit's symptoms and contraception, ignoring the broader query about previously prescribed medications and current treatments for existing conditions (eczema)."
