  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies specific screenings via fever (infectious like pneumonia/bronchitis), runny nose (URI/viral wheeze), sick contacts (contagious), travel (exposure infections), rashes (systemic/allergic/viral), phlegm (productive vs reactive), with all denied, narrowing to reactive airway. Generated Answer incorrectly claims doctor screening primarily for viral infection vs seasonal allergies, falsely states fever/runny nose/sick contact questions absent (citing wrong D-14/D-20), ignores specific conditions excluded by those questions, and focuses on symptoms/history/allergies instead; significant contradictions and errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: detailed mapping of each listed question (fever D7/P7 no, runny D8/P8 no, sick D10/P10 no, travel D11/P11 no, rashes D13/P13 no, phlegm D31/P31 no) to screened conditions (infectious/systemic), plus pain/looks fine/past virals, narrowing to reactive. Generated covers 0% of these specific mappings/responses; mentions unrelated viral history (P15) and allergies (P35/36/38), missing all key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites transcript accurately for some symptoms (P1/2/32/15/35/36/38) but hallucinates absence of fever/runny/sick questions (they exist at D7/8/10), wrong citations (D14 pain, D20 growth), invents 'Knowledge Graph' not in transcript, and misattributes screening intent; multiple unverifiable/hallucinated claims.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on specific questions (fever, runny, sick contacts, travel, rashes, phlegm) and responses narrowing differential; Generated ignores these questions entirely (claims some absent), pivots to viral/allergies via symptoms/history, failing to address core query directly."
