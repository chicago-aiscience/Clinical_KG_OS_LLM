  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer’s identification of symptoms cited by the doctor in D-36. For “some sort of an infection,” it correctly lists fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches. For why COVID-19 could not be ruled out, it correctly lists difficulty breathing plus sore throat and cough as the additional distinct symptoms the doctor referenced. No contradictions or incorrect symptom attributions are present.",
    "completeness": "It includes all key symptom groupings from the Gold Answer that directly answer the question: (1) fevers + fatigue + muscle aches as evidence of general infection, and (2) difficulty breathing + sore throat + cough as the features preventing COVID from being ruled out. The Gold Answer’s extra note that loss of taste/smell was not mentioned in the doctor’s summary is not required to answer the question and does not represent a meaningful omission for this prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptom claims are directly supported by D-36, with the quoted language accurately reflecting the transcript. The brief linkage to the patient feeling rundown/tired is supported by P-1 and is presented as correlation rather than a new doctor-stated symptom. No significant hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the exact symptoms asked for (general infection evidence vs. additional symptoms prompting inability to rule out COVID), with only minimal, non-distracting elaboration."
