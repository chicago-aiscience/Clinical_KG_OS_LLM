  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists five specific key clinical findings recapped by the doctor in D-58: (1) 3-4 day dry cough with fever and headache, (2) no sputum, (3) limited recent contacts sick (brother 2 weeks ago), (4) no asthma, (5) meds only Claritin. Generated Answer only covers partial (1): dry cough, fever, headache; misses (2)-(5) entirely, introducing significant omissions relative to Gold. For Jessica's goal, Gold specifies 'know if have to take medicine' (P-60); Generated misattributes doctor's framing ('next steps/where to go') directly to Jessica, though she agrees; this is a factual discrepancy. Overall, core partial match but significant errors/omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Doctor's 5 findings + Jessica's medicine question (primary) + rest desire (secondary). Generated covers ~20% (partial doctor's finding 1 + loose next steps proxy); misses no sputum, contacts/brother, no asthma, Claritin/meds, exact medicine goal, rest mention. 20-49% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in D-58 for doctor's partial summary (direct paraphrase). Jessica's goal claim grounded in D-58 context (doctor states, she affirms 'yeah' then specifies medicine), no fabrication, but loose attribution plausible without direct quote; minor interpretive stretch but transcript-supported.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response to question with bolded sections on doctor's findings and Jessica's goal, cites D-58, no off-topic content; perfectly focused."
