  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma (specifically exercise-induced and cold-weather exacerbated). The supporting facts derived from the transcript (activity triggers, cold weather, seasonal allergies, and multiple settings) align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses three significant components found in the Gold Answer: 1) the reversibility of symptoms with rest (which was explicitly mentioned in the prompt), 2) the presence of nocturnal symptoms (waking at night), and 3) the pertinent negatives (lack of fever/phlegm) that rule out infectious causes. It covers roughly 60% of the key diagnostic points provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful to the transcript. However, it repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the provided source transcript, constituting a minor hallucination regarding the source materials. The clinical claims themselves are supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the prompt's request for a diagnosis and supporting findings from the transcript. It remains focused on the clinical scenario."
