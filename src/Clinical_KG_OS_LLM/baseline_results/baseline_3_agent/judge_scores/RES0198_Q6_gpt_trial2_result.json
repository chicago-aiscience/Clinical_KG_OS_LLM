  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated working diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold), COVID swab testing, and isolation guidance while awaiting results. It does not introduce incorrect recommendations. The phrasing that the swab is to “confirm or rule out COVID-19” is slightly inferential but consistent with the doctor’s rationale (“symptoms can also be seen in covid patients, so we will also get a swab done”).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) diagnosis: viral infection/common cold; (2) hydrate; (3) OTC meds like Tylenol Cold; (4) COVID swab ordered; (5) isolate at home/avoid others while awaiting results; (6) results timeframe (48 hours) included.\nKey elements missed from Gold Answer: (a) expectation setting that symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve; (b) statement that there’s not much beyond supportive care for a viral infection; (c) test timing detail that the swab would be done “today”; (d) public health follow-up note: “further instructions from public health” after results. Overall, this is ~50–79% of the Gold plan details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by [D-39]. Minor extrapolation includes stating the swab is explicitly to “confirm or rule out” COVID-19 (implied but not verbatim). No major hallucinations or additions beyond the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested components (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance). It is on-topic throughout, though it omits some end-of-visit management details requested in the prompt (symptom duration expectation and public health next steps)."

  "summary": "Accurate and largely transcript-grounded summary of the diagnosis, key supportive care, COVID testing, and isolation advice, but missing several end-of-visit plan elements (time-to-resolution, “supportive care only” framing, swab done today, and public health follow-up instructions)."
