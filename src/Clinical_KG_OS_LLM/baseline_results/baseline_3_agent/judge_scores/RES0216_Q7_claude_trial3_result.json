  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors and omissions. It correctly identifies the three-day duration and that symptoms started during a walk, but fails to mention key facts: that symptoms have been 'staying the same' (P-2, P-3), that the tightness is 'kind of always there' but worse with activity (P-9, P-10), that getting up from a chair and deep breathing also exacerbate symptoms (P-9), and most importantly, that the patient has reduced from multiple walks per day to just one walk (P-22). The statement about D-36 regarding not getting out of breath is misattributed and misinterpreted. The claim that 'the transcript does not explicitly state' symptom progression is incorrect since P-2 clearly states symptoms are 'staying the same.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 40% of key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: symptom progression (staying the same), that nothing particular triggered onset, the 'always there' baseline nature of symptoms, specific exacerbating factors beyond walking (chair rising, deep breaths), the reduction from multiple to one daily walk, no missed work time, and the functional impact assessment. It only partially covers onset, location, and walking exacerbation.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains significant grounding issues. The statement about D-36 is incorrectly attributed - D-36 is the doctor's response, not patient information about symptoms. The claim that the transcript doesn't state symptom progression directly contradicts P-2. The answer also adds interpretive language not in the transcript (e.g., 'feel different than their typical asthma symptoms' from D-36 is misrepresented). However, basic facts about three-day duration and walking exacerbation are correctly grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question's components but does so incompletely. It touches on onset, symptom nature, activities, and walking routine, but fails to adequately answer key parts: the evolution over three days (better/worse/same), specific activities beyond walking that exacerbate symptoms, and how symptoms have actually affected the walking routine (reduction in frequency). About 60% relevant with significant gaps."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all dimensions. It contains factual errors (claiming symptom progression isn't stated when it clearly is in P-2), misattributes information (incorrectly referencing D-36), and omits critical details such as symptoms being constant but worse with activity, the reduction from multiple to one daily walk, and additional exacerbating factors. The answer covers less than half of the Gold Answer's key points and includes grounding issues that undermine faithfulness. While it maintains some relevance to the question, the incomplete coverage and factual inaccuracies result in a below-average evaluation."
