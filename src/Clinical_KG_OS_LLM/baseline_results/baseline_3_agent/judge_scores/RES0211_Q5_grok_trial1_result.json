  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: it incorrectly claims the transcript lacks information on Jessica's father (allergies [P-33]), cousin (asthma [P-30]), farm living ([P-43,P-44]), home-schooling ([P-41]), and COVID context, which are all present. It partially aligns on brother's cold ([P-39,D-58]) and allergies not in season ([P-16,P-17]), but shifts focus to diagnosing 'common cold' (not in Gold or transcript) and omits family asthma/allergies and isolation reducing external exposures. Core relation of factors to symptoms (atopy risk + likely household viral transmission in isolated setting) is contradicted or ignored.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: brother's cold a few weeks ago (partial), allergies not yet seasonal. Missed: father allergies [P-33], cousin asthma [P-30], farm location [P-43,P-44], home-schooling/mom home/dad farm [P-41,P-42], limited outings/no travel [P-45,P-46], only dog/no animal farm exposures [P-48], collective implication of intra-household transmission in isolated environment. Covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Major hallucination: asserts transcript lacks info on father, cousin, asthma, farm, home-schooling, COVID—directly contradicted by explicit transcript segments (e.g., [P-30],[P-33],[P-41-44],[P-48]). Invented 'knowledge graph'; transcript has no diagnosis of 'common cold' (D-58 summarizes symptoms/exposure but no dx). Symptom citations ([P-1],[P-4],etc.) accurate, but brother's timing misstated as 'two weeks' without noting 'few weeks' variability. Multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Partially addresses brother's cold and allergies relating to symptoms, but ignores question's specified factors (dad allergies, cousin asthma, farm/home-schooling/COVID isolation). Diverts to unrelated diagnosis of 'common cold' and transcript denial, failing to explain collective relation (familial atopy + isolated household viral source)."
