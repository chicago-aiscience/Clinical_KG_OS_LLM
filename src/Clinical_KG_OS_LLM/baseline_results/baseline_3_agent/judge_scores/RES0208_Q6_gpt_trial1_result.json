  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on the core plan: chest exam, chest X‑ray, COVID swab, self-isolation away from everyone including wife, results in 24–48 hours, and disposition based on results. Minor issues: it incorrectly cites the chest X‑ray as ordered in [D-36] (the ordering is in [D-37]), and it lists the physical examination under “Diagnostic Tests Ordered,” which is not a diagnostic test (though it is part of the management plan). Overall, facts are essentially correct with minor categorization/citation errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers essentially all Gold Answer key elements: (1) planned physical exam of chest, (2) ordered chest X‑ray and COVID swab, (3) self-isolation instructions including staying away from wife, (4) results timeline 24–48 hours, (5) public health nurse contact/instructions if positive, and (6) admission vs discharge decision based on results. It does not explicitly restate the Gold Answer’s clarification that no numerical thresholds were provided, but it does not add any incorrect thresholds either.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in [D-37] and [D-38]. However, there are minor grounding/citation problems: referencing [D-36] for the chest X‑ray/physical exam ordering (the explicit plan is in [D-37]), and treating the physical exam as a “diagnostic test.” No major hallucinated interventions or timelines beyond the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by summarizing the management plan, including diagnostics, physical exam, self-isolation instructions and source, result timeline, and admission vs discharge criteria. No meaningful tangents."
