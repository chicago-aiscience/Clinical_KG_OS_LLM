  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and omissions. It fails to identify the key constitutional symptoms that were actually screened: night sweats (D-5/P-5), unexplained weight loss (D-6-D-8/P-6-P-8), and hemoptysis (D-10/P-10). While it mentions hemoptysis at D-47, it misses the specific earlier questioning. It incorrectly emphasizes 'cat exposure' and 'substance use' as major screening points, when these are tangential to TB screening. The Gold Answer clearly identifies the classic TB triad (night sweats, weight loss, chronic cough) which the Generated Answer completely misses. The Generated Answer also fails to mention critical exposure risks like sick contacts, travel history, and IV drug use that were systematically assessed.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) specific denial of night sweats with soaked sheets, (2) specific denial of unexplained weight loss and loose-fitting clothes, (3) the early hemoptysis screening at D-10, (4) sick contacts at multiple locations (pole dancing class, recent contacts, roommate), (5) travel history screening, (6) IV drug use and cocaine/heroin screening, (7) stiff neck assessment, (8) nausea/vomiting screening, and (9) body pain assessment. It only partially captures the hemoptysis screening and general constitutional symptoms concept.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer shows moderate faithfulness issues. While most claims can be traced to the transcript, it misrepresents the emphasis and importance of certain questions. The focus on 'cat exposure' [P-27] as a major screening point for TB/chronic infection is misleading - this was about allergies, not infectious disease screening. The claim about 'constitutional symptoms' being screened at D-47 is problematic because D-47 is a summary statement, not the actual screening. The actual screening occurred earlier (D-4-D-8). The answer also fails to cite the specific earlier instances where key symptoms were assessed.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question but with significant gaps in relevance. It attempts to identify screened symptoms and excluded conditions (TB and chronic infections), which is on-topic. However, by emphasizing cat exposure and substance use over the classic TB screening triad, it misdirects attention from the most clinically relevant screening questions. The section on 'Serious Conditions Excluded' correctly identifies TB and chronic infections but doesn't explain why the specific denials (night sweats, weight loss) are particularly important for TB screening."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies in identifying the key constitutional symptoms and exposure risks screened. It fails to recognize the classic TB screening triad (night sweats, weight loss, chronic cough with hemoptysis assessment) that was systematically evaluated. Instead, it incorrectly emphasizes tangential factors like cat exposure and substance use. Major omissions include the specific questioning about night sweats, weight loss, sick contacts, travel history, and IV drug use. While the answer correctly identifies TB and chronic infections as conditions being excluded, it lacks the clinical depth to explain why the specific denials are significant. The answer covers less than 50% of key points and contains factual errors in emphasis and citation, though most claims remain grounded in the transcript."
