  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies that the patient’s first symptom was a stuffy nose and that the fever has lasted three days. However, it places the sore throat after the fever (“subsequently developed a sore throat”), which contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer: the patient indicates the sore throat occurred before/around fever onset and is ongoing (P-1). The husband comparison is directionally correct (husband sick ~1 week, patient fever 3 days), but it misses the Gold Answer’s more precise interpretation that the husband’s illness began ~4 days before the patient’s fever onset and does not clearly anchor the patient’s non-fever symptoms relative to fever onset.",
    "completeness": "Includes key elements: stuffy nose first, fever for three days, sore throat ongoing, muscle aches present, and husband with similar symptoms for a week. Missing or weaker elements vs Gold: (1) correct sequencing of sore throat (it developed before/around fever onset, not after), (2) explicit statement that muscle aches overlapped temporally with fever (past 2–3 days, confirmed as same time as fever), and (3) the Gold Answer’s clearer staggered-onset comparison (husband ~4 days earlier than patient’s fever onset).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (stuffy nose, fever duration, sore throat persistence, muscle aches, husband sick for a week). However, the claim that the sore throat developed after the fever is not supported by the transcript, and the statement implying it is “a direct result of her husband's prior exposure” is speculative (not explicitly stated).",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the requested chronological progression and compares the patient’s timeline with her husband’s symptom onset, with minimal extraneous information."
