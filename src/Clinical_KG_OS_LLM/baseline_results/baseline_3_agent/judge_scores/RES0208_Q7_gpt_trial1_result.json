  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the core temporal anchors: symptoms starting “a couple of days” ago (shortness of breath, fatigue/rundown, weakness, decreased appetite), subjective fever “yesterday,” and new sensory change “this morning” (loss of taste). It also correctly characterizes cough and sore throat as just starting. A minor issue is categorizing loss of taste under “just beginning to emerge,” whereas it was specifically noted as present that morning (i.e., already present, not merely emerging). No major contradictions to the Gold Answer otherwise.",
    "completeness": "Captures: shortness of breath, fatigue/rundown, weakness, reduced appetite, subjective fever yesterday, loss of taste in the morning, emerging cough, emerging sore throat. Misses several Gold Answer elements: diminished smell (acknowledged when asked), generalized body aches/achiness, and the mild headaches (not above baseline), as well as the nuance that breathing felt more “laborious.” Overall coverage is partial (~60–75%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most clinical claims are supported by the transcript with appropriate pointers (P-1/2/4/7/9, D-36). However, the response introduces unverifiable/extraneous content (“provided medical knowledge graph,” and COVID-19 alignment language) that is not in the transcript and is not necessary for the asked reconstruction. These additions reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "Focused on reconstructing symptom chronology and largely adheres to the question’s requested structure (onset vs yesterday vs emerging), with only minor tangential COVID/knowledge-graph framing."
