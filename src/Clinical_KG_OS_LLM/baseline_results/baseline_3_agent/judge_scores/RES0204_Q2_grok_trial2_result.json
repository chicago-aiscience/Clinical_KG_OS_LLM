  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) proposed by the doctor, matching the Gold Answer, with accurate citations [D-37, D-39]. The rationale for the COVID swab is quoted precisely as 'with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately' [D-39], aligning with the Gold's description of institutional protocol. However, it introduces a minor discrepancy by mentioning 'the knowledge graph as a procedure taken for the diagnosis of COVID,' which is not present in the Gold Answer or transcript, representing a small fabrication.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: confirmation of no medications/history (premise of question), two procedures (chest X-ray [D-37] and COVID nasal swab [D-39]), X-ray explanation, swab rationale as protocol [D-39], discomfort/reassurance [D-39], plan to arrange/discuss [D-40], no treatments. Generated covers 100% of core question elements (procedures and specific COVID rationale) but misses elaborations like X-ray explanation as 'picture of body inside,' swab as nasal/uncomfortable/reassurance, and full plan, covering ~85-90% overall.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about procedures and rationale are directly verifiable with accurate quotes and citations from [D-37] and [D-39] in the transcript. The addition of 'knowledge graph' is unverifiable and hallucinated, as no such reference exists in the transcript; otherwise, fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists the proposed procedures and provides the exact rationale for the COVID swab as requested by the question, with no off-topic content or tangents."
