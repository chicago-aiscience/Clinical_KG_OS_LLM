  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major elements of the management plan from the Gold Answer, including labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs), imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (O2 saturation, COVID swab), and therapeutics (supplemental O2, steroids, antibiotics, continuation of bronchodilators with specific names). Minor discrepancies: COVID swab categorized under monitoring instead of labs, and omission of blood pressure monitoring mentioned in Gold Answer from [D-37]; however, core facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: all labs except explicit COVID swab placement (still mentioned), chest X-ray, O2 sat monitoring and supplemental O2, steroids, antibiotics, bronchodilator continuation (enhanced with drug names). Missed: explicit mention of ongoing blood pressure monitoring for kidney complications [D-37]. Covers ~90-95% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: labs, imaging, COVID swab, O2 sat/O2, steroids, antibiotics, bronchodilators all from [D-52]; Ventolin/Spiriva from [P-11]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured to directly address the question by categorizing into diagnostic workup (labs, imaging, monitoring) and therapeutics, listing all specified elements (labs, imaging, monitoring, steroids, antibiotics, O2, bronchodilators) with no off-topic content."
