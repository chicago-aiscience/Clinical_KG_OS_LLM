  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as asthma and correctly states the counterfactual scenario (cough/SOB without fever) from [D-45]. It also correctly identifies the clinical finding leading to deprioritizing asthma in the current workup as the presence of fever (reported >100°F in [P-1]/[P-2]) and aligns with the doctor’s conclusion that it “sounds like an infection” [D-45]. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It covers the two key required elements from the Gold Answer: (1) asthma would be added if presentation were different, and (2) fever is the specific finding that led the doctor to exclude/prioritize away asthma in the current workup. It does not include the additional supportive details noted in the Gold Answer (e.g., no wheeze [P-7], unclear SOB [P-8], and nuance that asthma isn’t permanently ruled out), so it’s slightly less complete than the Gold Answer’s full framing.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate citations ([D-45], [P-1]). The phrase “Based on the clinical transcript and knowledge graph” introduces an element (“knowledge graph”) not present in the transcript, but it does not materially change the medical content. Otherwise, statements are grounded and consistent with the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what condition would have been added and which finding excluded it from the current workup, without irrelevant tangents."
