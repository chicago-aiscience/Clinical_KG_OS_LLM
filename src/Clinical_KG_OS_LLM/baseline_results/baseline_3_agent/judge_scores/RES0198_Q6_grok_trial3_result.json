  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states diagnosis as 'most likely a viral infection like the common cold' - Generated matches exactly. Supportive care: Gold lists hydration, Tylenol Cold, plus expectations of 'few weeks' and 'supportive only' - Generated covers hydration and Tylenol but omits expectations phrasing. Diagnostic: Gold specifies 'swab today, 48 hours' - Generated mentions swab for COVID but omits 'today'; places 48 hours under public health. Public health: Gold has isolate home/not see others + further from public health - Generated covers isolate/avoid contact + until 48 hours but omits explicit 'further instructions from public health'. No factual errors, minor omissions/discrepancies in phrasing/timing placement, core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: 1. Diagnosis (viral/common cold) - covered. 2. Hydrated - covered. 3. Tylenol Cold - covered. 4. Few weeks/supportive only - missed. 5. Swab today - partially (swab yes, today no). 6. 48 hours - covered. 7. Isolate home/not see others - covered. 8. Further public health instructions - missed. Covers ~85% of points (all core but misses 3 minor/nuanced ones).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from [D-39]: viral/common cold, hydrated, Tylenol cold, swab today (inferred/omitted but no hall.), pandemic/COVID symptoms, 48 hours, isolate home/not see anyone, further public health. Generated cites [D-39]; phrases like 'confirm or rule out' plausible inference, no fabrication. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response mirroring question: Diagnosis, Supportive Care (bulleted specifics), Diagnostic Testing, Public Health Guidance. No tangents, directly addresses all requested elements perfectly."
