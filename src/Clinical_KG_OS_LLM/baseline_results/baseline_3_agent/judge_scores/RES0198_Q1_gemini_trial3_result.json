  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy and runny nose) and their progression. However, it incorrectly states that the character of the discharge is not specified, whereas P-5 clearly states it is 'mostly clear'. It also incorrectly claims that the context for denied symptoms is missing, when the transcript explicitly shows the doctor's questions and the patient's denials for cough (P-4), post-nasal drip (P-6), sore throat (P-7), and loss of taste/smell (P-16).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses approximately 60-70% of the specific details requested. It fails to provide the character of the discharge and fails to list any of the explicitly denied symptoms, both of which were key components of the prompt and the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the provided transcript. It claims information is missing (discharge character and specific denied symptoms) that is clearly present in the source text. This is a failure of grounding.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to answer each part of the prompt, but it provides incorrect 'missing information' conclusions for two out of the three sections."
