  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer accurately cites and explains smoking (pack/day since age 15, [P-37,P-38]), occupational role (engineering consultant chemical plant Sarnia, low exposure [P-33,P-34]), family history (grandfather lung cancer, smoker [P-42]), and relates to presentation (infection risk, malignancy vigilance). Generated Answer incorrectly claims smoking pack-a-day since 15 'not elicited' and misattributes to cannabis cessation [P-40]; denies occupational history entirely; only partially covers family. Major factual contradictions on core elements.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold: 1) Smoking details and relation to mucociliary/immune impairment, COPD, cancer; 2) Occupational details and mitigated exposure; 3) Family details and genetic risk; 4) Synthesis re hemoptysis/infection vs malignancy. Generated covers only family history partially (~25%), denies/misses smoking and occupational entirely, no proper relations or synthesis. Covers <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims: Family verifiable [P-42]; smoking misread (confuses tobacco [P-36-38] with cannabis [P-40], hallucinates absence); occupational hallucinates absence despite [P-33-34]; adds unasked presentation/medical history. Multiple unverifiable/misread claims, not grounded.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on relating three specified risk factors to presentation and elicited details. Generated addresses elicitation/risks but denies two exist in transcript (wrongly), adds irrelevant presentation summary and Lipitor; partial focus but significant off-topic denial/errors."
