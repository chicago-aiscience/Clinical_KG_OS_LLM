  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key symptoms (worsening cough from P-1, sputum changes to yellow from P-6, increased dyspnea from P-1) and COPD history (P-1), matching the Gold Answer's core facts. It correctly quotes the doctor's linking statement from D-52. Minor discrepancies include less precise timelines (e.g., grouping all symptoms as 'last week' when dyspnea is 'few days') and citations (e.g., dyspnea cited P-1 instead of P-8), but no factual errors or contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: worsening cough, sputum changes, increased dyspnea, COPD history, doctor's synthesis in D-52. Missed details: cough specifics (frequency, triggered by stairs from P-5), sputum implying infection, precise SOB progression (needing to sit after walks from P-8), COPD duration (5 years from P-2), inhalers (Ventolin/Spiriva from P-11), and 'acute-on-chronic' framing. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms and quotes verifiable in transcript (P-1, P-6, D-52 accurate). However, multiple references to 'Knowledge Graph' and its support for reasoning are not in transcript, representing hallucinated content. Core clinical claims grounded, but extraneous fabrication present.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by specifying the symptom triad + COPD history and quoting the doctor's exact linkage in D-52; structured response perfectly focused with only minor extraneous KG mention."
