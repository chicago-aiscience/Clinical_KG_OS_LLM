  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's suspicion of COVID-19 based on overlapping symptoms [D-52] and lists key initial symptoms from [P-1] (headache, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), which align with the Gold Answer's core symptoms. It accurately highlights loss of smell [P-24] as the particularly characteristic symptom, matching the Gold. Minor discrepancies include omitting details like 'dry cough' [P-12], 'persistent headache' specifics [P-3,P-5], fatigue [P-19], and pertinent negatives, but core facts are consistent without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: doctor's statement on ruling out COVID [D-52] (yes), symptom combination including headache, cough, GI symptoms (partial: misses dry cough detail, fatigue), loss of smell as characteristic (yes). Missed: doctor's specific question on smell/taste [D-24], full list details (persistent headache, fatigue), alternative viral illness [D-52], pertinent negatives (no fever, no runny nose, no aches). Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: symptoms from [P-1], doctor's suspicion [D-52], loss of smell [P-24]. Citations accurate. The interpretive notation '[SYMPTOM] smell loss --[INDICATES]--> [DIAGNOSIS] covid' is not verbatim but directly infers from context without fabrication; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question: specifies symptom combination leading to COVID suspicion and identifies loss of smell as characteristic vs. other virals. No off-topic content; perfectly focused."
