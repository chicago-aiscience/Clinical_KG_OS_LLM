  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline: cough starting Wednesday night as a little dry cough, persisting and worsening slightly on Thursday with tiredness, and further worsening on Friday with new onset fever over 100°F, continued fatigue, decreased appetite, and suspected loss of taste. Minor discrepancies include not specifying the exact fever range (100.1-101°F), omitting the runny nose on Friday, not mentioning keeping the child home on Thursday, and adding speculative breathing difficulty from mother's uncertainty in [P-8] rather than confirming it as a symptom; however, no major factual errors contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: Wednesday evening cough onset after seeming fine [P-1]; Thursday cough persistence/worsening and tiredness [P-1]; Friday cough worsening, new fever [P-1], fatigue continuation [P-1/P-8/P-25], decreased appetite and possible loss of taste [P-15/P-17]. Missed: explicit 'kept home Thursday', precise fever temps (100.1/101) [P-2], mild runny nose [P-16], mother's stepwise summary [P-12], and 3-day duration correction [P-4]. Covers approximately 85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1] for timeline, [P-15/P-17] for appetite/taste). Minor unverifiable elements include interpreting [P-8] as 'perhaps struggling slightly with breathing' (mother's speculation: 'maybe... harder time breathing' but attributes to tiredness), mentioning doctor's inquiry on chest pain [D-13] (not a reported symptom), and including consultation recommendations [D-44] (irrelevant to symptoms); no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured day-by-day addressing the question's focus on cough onset (Wed night), severity progression (worsening Thu/Fri), fever emergence (Fri), and other symptoms like fatigue (Thu/Fri) and decreased appetite (Fri). Minor tangents include speculative breathing issues, doctor's questions, and treatment recommendations, which are not central to symptom evolution."
