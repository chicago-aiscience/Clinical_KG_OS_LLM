  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer accurately states that the cough began ~4–5 days prior and had not improved (consistent with P-2 and the later clarification that it “stayed the same” in P-7). It correctly reports runny nose onset in the past couple of days and clear discharge (P-11, P-12). It accurately references lack of wheeze/SOB and prior asthma workup (P-28). However, it slightly overstates clinician intent for imaging (“intends to perform” vs the clinician “might want to do” an X-ray) and omits key factual descriptors of the cough (dry/non-productive) that are central to the question (though omission is scored more under completeness).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) cough onset 4–5 days before visit, (2) runny nose onset only past couple of days, (3) clear nasal discharge, (4) no wheeze/SOB history per mother. Key elements missed: (a) cough characterized as dry and non-productive throughout, (b) explicit statement that cough severity stayed the same since onset, (c) explicit relative timing (runny nose starting ~2–3 days after cough), and—most importantly—(d) comparison to prior similar symptoms: patient had never had a dry cough like this before and prior runny noses did not last this long. Overall this is roughly partial (about half) coverage of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references. Minor over-commitment occurs where the answer states the team “intends to perform” a chest X-ray/COVID swab, whereas the transcript presents these as proposed/likely steps (“might want,” “probably should”). No major hallucinated symptoms or timelines.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on symptom timeline and comparison, but includes tangential material (planned interventions) and spends space on fever history that is not central to the question. Still, the core content is related to the asked symptom development."
