  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details a 3-month intermittent dry cough becoming productive with greenish gross gunk (no blood, no foul smell noticed) over past 3 days, first noticed at pole dancing, nightly waking last month causing fatigue, chest discomfort only on coughing, subjective hot at night past days (no temp), impaired exercise; denies night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis, N/V, stiff neck, body pain/tenderness, sick contacts. Generated correctly captures cough duration (3 months, worse 3 days), productive 'gross gunk' greenish sputum, pain on coughing, fatigue, sleep disturbance, no blood; however, inaccurately frames 'pain' as explicitly denied (P-19 denies body pain/tenderness but admits cough pain P-3), omits initial dry/intermittent nature, foul smell, night waking frequency/duration, fevers, exercise impact, most denials. Some factual errors/misrepresentations but core cough/sputum facts align.",
    "completeness": "Covered: cough 3 months & recent worsening, gross greenish gunk/sputum, pain on cough, fatigue, sleep disturbance, denied blood & pain. Missed: initial dry/intermittent/recurrent (P-2), onset at pole class (P-13), no foul smell (P-11), nightly waking last month specifics (P-20/21), chest discomfort only on cough nuance, subjective fevers/hot nights (P-4), exercise impairment (P-47), denies night sweats (P-5), weight loss (P-6-8), N/V (P-17), stiff neck (P-18), sick contacts (P-14/15/32). Covers ~25-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: cough duration/worsening (P-2, D-47), gross gunk (P-2/P-9), painful cough (P-3), greenish sputum (P-9), tiredness/sleep issues (P-19, D-47, P-20/21 implied), denied pain quote exact (P-19 context body pain), no blood (P-10 summarized D-47). Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around respiratory symptoms (cough/sputum characteristics), associated symptoms (fatigue/sleep), and explicitly denied symptoms, perfectly matching question focus with no off-topic content."
