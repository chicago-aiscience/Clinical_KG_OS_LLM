  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition the doctor would have added if the presentation were different (cough/shortness of breath without fever) and correctly states that the presence of fever/high temperature led the doctor to prioritize infection and not pursue asthma workup at this time. This matches the Gold Answer and the key quote in [D-45].",
    "completeness": "Covers the two core required elements from the Gold Answer: (1) asthma would be added if cough/SOB without fever, and (2) fever/high temperature led to excluding asthma from the current workup in favor of infection. It does not include the Gold Answer’s supporting details (e.g., no wheeze [P-7], unclear SOB [P-8], and the nuance that asthma isn’t permanently ruled out), so it is slightly less complete than the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All material claims are grounded in the transcript, especially [D-45] and the mother’s report of fever ([P-1]). The brief mention of a “knowledge graph” is extraneous but does not introduce clinical facts. No hallucinated clinical findings.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question: names the condition and specifies the clinical finding that excluded it from the current workup. No meaningful tangents."
