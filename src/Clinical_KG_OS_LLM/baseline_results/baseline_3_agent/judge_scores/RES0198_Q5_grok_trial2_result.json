  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies COVID-19 as the potential infectious exposure source identified through the social history, but the Gold Answer specifies the nephew who attends daycare and lives with the patient [P-11, P-12] as the source from social history. Additionally, it fabricates a relationship where type 1 diabetes affects immune function and necessitates specific management due to this, which contradicts the Gold Answer stating no explicit link in the transcript. These are major factual errors and direct contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) nephew attends daycare and lives with patient [P-11]; (2) daycare as common source of respiratory viruses; (3) nephew not sick but still plausible [P-12]; (4) consistent with viral URI assessment [D-39]; (5) type 1 diabetes details [P-23, P-24, P-25, P-26]; (6) no explicit doctor link to immune risk. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, mentioning diabetes vaguely and COVID testing instead. Missed all key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims COVID-19 as exposure source from social history unverifiable (social history points to nephew/daycare, not COVID; [D-39] is differential in pandemic context). Diabetes impacting immune function and management hallucinated (not in transcript). Citations to [D-39], [P-23], [P-25] accurate but misinterpreted. Multiple hallucinated facts about exposure and immune link.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer addresses a potential exposure (COVID) and ties it to diabetes/management, but ignores 'social history' specification, focusing on doctor's COVID concern instead of nephew/daycare. Partially relevant to question structure but largely off-topic on core elements."
