  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer bases the connection on the timing of the seizure the same night as the missed dose due to disrupted routine [P-8, P-24], patient's recognition in P-9, rarity of seizures, and one-time lapse; Generated Answer correctly identifies missed Keppra and quotes P-9 accurately for patient recognition but introduces general medical knowledge ('known precipitant') not emphasized in Gold or transcript, slightly overstating causality beyond patient's view and timing, representing a minor discrepancy while core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: seizure same night as missed Keppra due to birthday/disrupted dinner [P-8, P-24]; patient spontaneously recognizes link in P-9 ('forgot med... might have yeah') after D-9, notes seizures usually rare; one-time lapse; no clinician confirmation. Generated covers: missed Keppra causal to seizure, P-9 recognition/quote, Keppra named [P-23]. Misses: timing details, birthday context [P-24], rarity of seizures, voluntary context, lack of clinician input (~60% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated quotes P-9 and cites P-23 accurately, verifiable in transcript; patient's recognition directly from words; however, 'non-adherence... known precipitant' is general knowledge not stated in transcript, introducing a plausible but unverifiable claim; no other hallucinations, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly answers both question parts: causal connection of missed dose to seizure and specific transcript evidence (P-9) of patient's recognition, with no off-topic content."
