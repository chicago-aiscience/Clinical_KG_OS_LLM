  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered and ruled out, consistent with the mother’s report that the grandparents had asthma and that the patient “doesn’t get short of breath or wheezing… even with physical activity” [P-28]. No incorrect clinical claims are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) asthma was considered/rule-out; (2) positive family history in grandparents; (3) mother-cited pertinent negatives: no shortness of breath, no wheeze; (4) explicitly noted absence even with physical activity. Key Gold Answer points missed: the mother’s statement that he has “been worked up for that” (prior evaluation) as part of the rationale for ruling out asthma; the additional contextual detail that he’s been “pretty healthy otherwise”/no prior similar chronic pattern [P-24] (less central to the question than the mother’s findings). Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements (family history of asthma; absence of shortness of breath and wheezing, including with physical activity) are directly supported by the transcript [P-28]. No hallucinated findings or tests are added.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses what condition was ruled out and the specific negatives the mother used to rule it out, including the explicit exercise-related absence of symptoms. No meaningful irrelevant content."
