  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies shortness of breath, cough, phlegm production, and the sputum change from clear-to-white to yellow, matching Gold. However, it fails to note the worsening of cough over the last week beyond chronic baseline, triggers like minimal exertion, severity of SOB requiring sitting to recover, chest discomfort during coughing fits, and chills over the last couple days. It incorrectly states no systemic symptoms endorsed (e.g., explicitly omits chills, which are systemic). For denies, it lists minor symptoms but omits key ones like orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations, and others emphasized in Gold and question examples. Significant discrepancies and errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: increased SOB [partial], worsening cough [missed], sputum change [full], baseline context [partial via sputum]. Missed: cough triggers/exertion, chest discomfort, chills, no measured fever detail, and vast majority of pertinent negatives (e.g., orthopnea [P-9], PND [P-10], hemoptysis [P-7], palpitations [P-14], calf pain, dizziness, etc.—covers only ~6 minor denies out of ~20+). Covers ~20-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All specific symptom claims (SOB/cough [P-1], phlegm/sputum details [P-6], listed denies [P-17,21,24,25,26,27]) are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, claim of 'no systemic symptoms endorsed such as fever, chills' is unverifiable and incorrect as chills are explicitly endorsed [P-29]; this misrepresents transcript. No outright fabrications, but erroneous absence claim.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around endorsed respiratory/systemic symptoms, sputum change, and denied symptoms, mirroring question structure with sections. No irrelevant or off-topic content, fully focused despite incompleteness."
