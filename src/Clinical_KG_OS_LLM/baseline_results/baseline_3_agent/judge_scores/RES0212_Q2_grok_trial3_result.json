  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient uses condoms for contraception [P-45], which matches the Gold Answer. It correctly notes no medications prescribed for current symptoms and that the doctor is reviewing the case [D-47], consistent with the transcript and Gold. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer; all claims are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) no current medications [P-29]; (2) current moisturizing creams for eczema [P-23]; (3) past prescribed eczema cream [P-23]; (4) no drug allergies [P-28]; (5) minor possible cat allergy, no meds [P-27]; (6) condoms, no hormonal BC [P-45]; (7) marijuana vape ~every 2 weeks [P-36/37]; (8) alcohol ~5-6 beers weekends [P-41/42]; (9) no OTC cough remedies. Generated covers only (6) condoms and partially implies (1) via no Rx for symptoms. Misses 7/9 key points (~10-20% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated (condoms [P-45], no Rx for symptoms, doctor reviewing [D-47]) are directly verifiable in transcript. Citations accurate. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrication; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses the question by listing a current treatment (condoms) and current medication status (none prescribed for symptoms at visit). No irrelevant or off-topic content; perfectly focused on query aspects."
