  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the onset (1 week), initial symptom (stuffy nose first), and shift to predominant runny nose, matching Gold. However, it only references the initial 'on and off' description [P-1] for intermittency without noting the later clarification of 'pretty constant' [P-8], and omits the decongestant influence [P-10] and lack of improvement [P-1], creating minor discrepancies while keeping core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Covers: onset (1 week), first symptom (stuffy), predominant change (to runny). Misses: decongestant as possible influence on shift, nuance in symptom pattern (initial on/off vs overall constant), and lack of improvement prompting visit. Covers approximately 60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: onset and 'on and off' from [P-1], stuffy first and now running from [P-3]. Citations accurate, no hallucinated details or unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses chronological progression, first symptom, change in predominant symptom, and intermittency/constant nature with focused structure matching the question; no off-topic content."
