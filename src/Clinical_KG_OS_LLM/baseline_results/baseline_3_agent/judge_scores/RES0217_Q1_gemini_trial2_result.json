  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness). However, it incorrectly states that the doctor did not screen for fever, joint pain, or headaches. The transcript explicitly shows the doctor screening for joint pain in [D-7], fever in [D-8], and headaches in [D-19], all of which the patient denied.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first part of the question (local symptoms) well, but completely fails to provide the requested information for the second part (systemic symptoms), claiming the information is unavailable despite it being present in the source text.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination of absence. It claims the transcript does not contain evidence of systemic screening for fever, joint pain, or headaches, when these interactions are clearly recorded in segments [D-7], [D-8], and [D-19].",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it addresses the local symptoms, it fails to answer the specific query regarding systemic symptoms and the patient's denials, which was a primary component of the prompt."
