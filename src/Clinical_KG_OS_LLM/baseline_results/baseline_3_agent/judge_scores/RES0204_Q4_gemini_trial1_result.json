  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the condition (asthma), the relevant family history (grandparents), and the specific symptoms (shortness of breath and wheezing) mentioned in the transcript and gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points, including the condition, the family history, and the negative symptoms during physical activity. However, it misses the mother's statement that the patient had already 'been worked up' for asthma, which is a significant piece of evidence cited in the gold answer for why the condition was ruled out.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript, specifically turn [P-28]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without including extraneous information."
