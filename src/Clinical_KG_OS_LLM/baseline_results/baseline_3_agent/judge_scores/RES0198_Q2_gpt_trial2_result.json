  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient had tried OTC “decongestants” [P-10], accurately reflects the patient’s assessment that it “worked a little bit” (with the explanation that the nose became more runny, implying less congestion) [P-10], and correctly reports the clinician’s OTC recommendation of “Tylenol Cold” [D-39]. No contradictions with the Gold Answer were introduced.",
    "completeness": "It includes the main Gold Answer elements directly responsive to the question: (1) decongestants tried, (2) partial effectiveness (“a little bit” with the stuffy→runny rationale), and (3) the doctor’s OTC recommendation (Tylenol Cold). It omits other supportive-care items present in the Gold Answer (hydration; expectation of a few weeks; limited treatment beyond supportive care). Those are in the Gold Answer but are not explicitly asked in the question; still, relative to the Gold Answer content, this is a minor omission.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are grounded in the transcript: decongestants and “worked a little bit” are supported by [P-10], and Tylenol Cold is supported by [D-39]. No clear hallucinations or unsupported specifics.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the exact information requested (prior medication, perceived effectiveness, and recommended OTC treatment) without irrelevant tangents."
