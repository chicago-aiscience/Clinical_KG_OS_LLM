  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the patient's home medication for headache relief with accurate citations [P-3],[P-4], matching Gold. Doctor's recommendations for hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs (noted as 'anseads') for aches, isolation, and COVID swab align with Gold and [D-52]. Minor discrepancy in interpreting 'anseads' as 'analgesics' instead of NSAIDs explicitly, and no mention of no prescriptions, but core facts consistent. Knowledge graph reference is extra but factually aligns.",
    "completeness": "Covers: Tylenol for headache (100%); doctor's supportive measures (hydration, food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/anseads for aches - 100%); isolation and swab (100%). Misses patient's self-hydration effort [P-30] noted in Gold, and explicit 'no prescriptions'; covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims verifiable: Tylenol for headache [P-3,P-4]; doctor's plan verbatim from [D-52]. 'Knowledge graph' not in transcript (unverifiable/hallucinated addition). 'Anseads (analgesics)' plausible interpretation of transcript error for NSAIDs, minor issue.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to question parts: patient's medication/symptom, then doctor's additions/supportive measures; no tangents or off-topic content."
