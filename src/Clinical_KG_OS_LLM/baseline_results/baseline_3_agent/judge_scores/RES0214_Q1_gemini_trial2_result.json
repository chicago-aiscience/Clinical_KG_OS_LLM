  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle aches) and the five specific denied symptoms. However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the interaction: it claims the patient 'immediately began reporting her own history without answering' the question about neck stiffness [D-7], while the transcript shows she explicitly answered 'No' [P-7].",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the four required symptoms and addresses all five specific symptoms for denial (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing) as requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes a hallucination/factual error regarding the transcript interaction at [D-7]. Furthermore, it fails to ground the 'explicit denials' in the actual transcript lines where the patient said 'No' (P-5, P-7, P-8, P-10, P-24), instead incorrectly using the absence of symptoms in the initial statement [P-1] as evidence for an explicit denial.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the specific question asked, identifying the exact symptoms requested without unnecessary information."
