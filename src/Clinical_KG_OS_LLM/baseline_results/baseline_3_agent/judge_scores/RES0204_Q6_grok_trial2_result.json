  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core facts of the plan including the two diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab with accurate citations), the consultation with the supervising physician, and follow-up discussion, matching the Gold Answer. Minor discrepancies include omitting the physical examination of lungs and heart explicitly stated in [D-1] as part of the initial plan, slightly rephrasing the tentative nature of the X-ray ('might want to do'), and implying presentation of test findings post-consultation when tests are to be arranged afterward; however, core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic tests (chest X-ray [D-37], COVID swab [D-39]) fully; consultation with supervising physician [D-37, D-40]; follow-up steps to return and discuss next actions [D-40]. Partially covered: initial visit structure including physical exam of lungs/heart [D-1]; age-appropriate explanations; patient acknowledgment [P-40]; concluding thanks [D-41,42]. Covers ~85% of key points, missing some introductory and confirmatory details.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., tests in [D-37, D-39], consultation and follow-up in [D-1, D-40]). Minor unverifiable detail: 'present the findings from the tests' implies results available post-consultation, but transcript indicates tests are arranged after consultation without results yet ([D-40]); this is plausible but not explicitly stated. No hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured precisely around the question's requirements (diagnostic tests, consultation, follow-up steps), using clear headings and direct references to the transcript, with no off-topic content."
