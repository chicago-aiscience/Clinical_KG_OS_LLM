  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer has significant factual errors: incorrectly states COPD diagnosis as ~2 years ago citing [P-1] while ignoring correction to 5 years in [P-2]; falsely claims transcript does not specify exact daily smoking consumption despite clear details in [P-44] (half pack now, reduced from 1-2 packs); introduces hallucinated 'knowledge graph' linking smoking to lung cancer not present in transcript; core relation of smoking history to COPD timelines (10-year cough, 5-year dx consistent with exposure) is missing or contradicted.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: current smoker vaguely, father lung cancer and smoking [P-43]. Missed: specific current half pack/day [P-44], reduction from 1-2 packs [P-44], doctor's acknowledgment [D-45], no rec drugs [P-45], cough 10 years [P-3], COPD 5 years [P-2] consistent with smoking, patient worry [P-43], mother healthy [P-43], doctor query [D-43]. Covers ~20-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like COPD dx 2 years verifiable in [P-1] but ignores [P-2]; smoking details denied despite [P-44]; 'knowledge graph' and 'MEDICAL_HISTORY' links fully hallucinated/not in transcript; exacerbation diagnosis grounded [D-52] but adds unverified inflammatory process; multiple hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Partially addresses smoking (current only, no level/change) and family hx, relates vaguely as risk factor to COPD exacerbation; includes irrelevant symptom summary, diagnosis confirmation, management plan not central to question on histories' relation to underlying COPD dx."
