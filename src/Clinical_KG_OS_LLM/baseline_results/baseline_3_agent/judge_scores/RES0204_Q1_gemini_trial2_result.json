  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the transcript does not specify the nature of the cough (productive vs. non-productive). In reality, the transcript and gold answer explicitly state it is a dry, non-productive cough (D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the gold answer, including the specific 'dry' and 'non-productive' descriptors for the cough and the pertinent negatives of sore throat and chest pain. It also omits the patient's comparison to previous illnesses.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails faithfulness by asserting that information (the nature of the cough) is missing from the source text when it is clearly present. This is a negative hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in structure, addressing the specific symptoms and their characteristics as requested by the prompt, despite the errors in content."
