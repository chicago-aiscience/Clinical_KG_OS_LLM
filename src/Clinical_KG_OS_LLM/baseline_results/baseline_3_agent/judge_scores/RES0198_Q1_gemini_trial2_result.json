  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy and runny nose). However, it incorrectly states that the character of the discharge is not specified, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions it is 'mostly clear' [P-5]. It also incorrectly claims the context for denied symptoms is missing, even though the transcript clearly includes the doctor's questions regarding coughing [D-4], post-nasal drip [D-6], and sore throat/fever/chills [D-7].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide the specific character of the discharge and the list of denied symptoms (sore throat, cough, post-nasal drip, etc.) which were explicitly requested and available in the source text. It only covers about 33% of the required information from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a failure in faithfulness by claiming that information is absent from the provided text when it is clearly present. This is a form of 'negative hallucination' regarding the source content.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each section of the user's prompt (Reported Symptoms, Character of Discharge, Denied Symptoms), even though the content within those sections is largely incorrect."
