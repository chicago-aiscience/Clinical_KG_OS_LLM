  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on the key clinical facts: chest X-ray and COVID swab were ordered; a chest-focused physical exam was planned; discharge would require self-isolation away from everyone including wife; results expected in 24–48 hours; if positive, public health nurse would advise next steps; and admission vs discharge would be based on results. Minor issues: it incorrectly cites the chest X-ray/physical exam to [D-36] (the plan is stated in [D-37]); and it lists the “physical examination” under “Diagnostic Tests Ordered,” which is slightly imprecise (the exam is part of evaluation but not typically labeled a diagnostic test). These are minor and do not change the core plan.",
    "completeness": "Covers all Gold Answer elements: (1) planned physical exam (chest exam), (2) both ordered diagnostics (CXR and COVID swab), (3) self-isolation instructions including separation from wife, (4) result timeline (24–48 hours), (5) who provides instructions if positive (public health nurse), and (6) disposition criterion (based on results; no thresholds). Only small omission is that it does not explicitly state that no numerical thresholds were provided, but it does reflect the same concept (decision based on results).",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are supported by the transcript, especially [D-37]. However, the answer references [D-36] for the chest X-ray/physical exam plan, which is not where those appear; this is a citation grounding error. Also, characterizing the physical exam as a “diagnostic test ordered” is a mild framing distortion (though an exam is indeed planned per [D-37], [D-38]). Overall, mostly grounded with minor inaccuracies in citation/labeling.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses every component asked in the question (tests, exam, isolation instructions and who would advise, timeline, and admission vs discharge criteria) without irrelevant tangents."
