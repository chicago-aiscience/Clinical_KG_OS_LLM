  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer misses key specific constitutional symptoms denied (night sweats [D5], weight loss [D6-8]) and most exposure risks (sick contacts [D14,15,32], travel [D33-34], IVDU/cocaine/heroin [D39-40]); incorrectly emphasizes irrelevant items like cat exposure [P27], vaping/marijuana [P36], and misrepresents sleep disturbance as denied constitutional symptom (patient admitted waking at night [P20-21]); partially correct on hemoptysis denial and TB exclusion via D47 summary, but significant discrepancies from Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: hemoptysis denial (~1 point), absence of constitutional symptoms summary [D47] (~1), TB exclusion (~1); missed: night sweats, weight loss details, all sick contacts, travel, specific drug risks, stiff neck/NV/pain, malignancy/endemic specifics (~80% missed); covers ~20-30%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded where cited (D47 for summary/hemoptysis, P36 substance, P27 cats), but hallucinates relevance of cats/vaping as key constitutional/exposure risks for TB; misrepresents patient denial of constitutional symptoms (admitted hot nights [P4], waking [P20], tiredness [P19]); stretches sleep disturbance as screened/denied; multiple inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "Addresses question structure (lists screened/denied items, TB exclusion), but dilutes with irrelevant content (cats, vaping/cigarettes) and omits core specifics, making it partially on-topic."
