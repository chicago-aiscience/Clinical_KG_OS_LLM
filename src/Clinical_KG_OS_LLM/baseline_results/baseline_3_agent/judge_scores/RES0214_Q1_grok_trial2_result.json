  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) matching the Gold Answer's list, with appropriate citations from P-1 and P-13. However, for denials, while it lists the five specified symptoms (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing) accurately, it inaccurately states that the patient did not answer the doctor's question on neck stiffness at D-7, claiming she began reporting her own history instead—this contradicts the transcript where P-7 explicitly says 'No.' Additionally, it relies on absence from initial reports (P-1, P-13) rather than explicit denials when asked (e.g., P-5 for nausea, P-8 for headaches, P-10 for cough, P-24-26 for difficulty swallowing), introducing factual discrepancies in evidence and interpretation. Core lists are correct, but significant errors in transcript details.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers: (1) four symptoms with details (stuffy nose first, persistent sore throat, fever for 3 days, muscle aches for 2-3 days coinciding with fever, no joint pain clarification) and citations; (2) explicit denials of the five symptoms with precise citations (P-10 cough, P-8 headaches, P-7 neck stiffness, P-5 nausea/vomiting, P-24-26 difficulty swallowing) plus extras. Generated covers the exact four symptoms with basic citations (100% match on identification) and lists the five denials (100% match), but misses all details (timings, persistence, clarifications), explicit denial citations, and distinctions like 'no vomiting' or swallowing ability confirmation. Covers ~60-70% of key points, primarily the lists but lacking depth and evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms verifiable: P-1 (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat), P-13 (muscle ache). Denials are true per transcript but not accurately cited—e.g., cough at P-10 'No cough', headaches P-8 'Um no, no headaches', neck stiffness P-7 'No', nausea P-5 'No', difficulty swallowing P-24-26 'Uh no, it just hurts... Yes... No'. Generated hallucinates for neck stiffness ('did not answer D-7, began reporting own history'), which is false as P-7 directly denies it; also implies denial solely from absence in P-1/P-13, unverifiable for explicit queries. Multiple inaccuracies and one clear fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the question: lists exactly four reported symptoms and the five specified denied symptoms, with supporting evidence section, no off-topic content or tangents—perfectly focused."
