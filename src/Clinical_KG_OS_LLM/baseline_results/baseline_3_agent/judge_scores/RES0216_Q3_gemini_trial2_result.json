  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely accurate but contains a minor discrepancy regarding the patient's medication. It states the patient is 'currently taking salbutamol' based on P-25, but the transcript (D-17, D-18, D-35) clarifies that the patient has not refilled their rescue inhaler in years and currently lacks one, which is why the doctor proposes a therapeutic trial with a new prescription. The rest of the clinical logic regarding symptoms and cardiac exclusion is correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. While it covers the patient's asthma history, general symptoms, and the exclusion of cardiac causes, it fails to mention: 1) the patient's specific medication non-adherence (skipping evening doses), 2) the lack of a rescue inhaler, 3) the absence of new environmental triggers, and 4) the doctor's use of a therapeutic rescue-puffer trial to confirm the diagnosis. It covers approximately 43% of the key reasoning points (3 out of 7 identified in the Gold Answer).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It accurately reflects the doctor's interpretation in D-36 regarding the patient not being 'out of breath,' even though this interpretation was slightly at odds with the patient's earlier statement in P-7. No hallucinations were found.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the combination of factors used and how the doctor linked them together. It stays focused on the diagnostic process for asthma exacerbation."
