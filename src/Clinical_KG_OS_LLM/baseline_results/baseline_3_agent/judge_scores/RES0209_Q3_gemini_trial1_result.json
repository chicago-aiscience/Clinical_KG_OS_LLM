  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the symptoms and increased medication usage point to an asthma exacerbation. However, it fails to mention the critical differential diagnosis aspect present in the Gold Answer—the ruling out of infectious etiologies (lack of fever, sick contacts, travel, etc.) which is essential to answering why it is not a 'new respiratory condition.' It also contains some citation errors regarding transcript IDs.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a significant portion of the Gold Answer's reasoning: the exclusionary evidence. While it explains why the symptoms fit asthma, it does not explain why other conditions were ruled out (denial of colds, fevers, loss of taste/smell, etc.). The Gold Answer explicitly uses these 'negatives' to support the conclusion that it is not a new condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source of information, which was not provided in the prompt. Additionally, several citations are incorrect: it cites [P-9] for frequency of use (which is actually in [P-8]) and cites [P-4] and [P-9] for chest tightness (which is actually in [P-20]).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question provided, though it misses the comparative/exclusionary logic required for a full answer."
