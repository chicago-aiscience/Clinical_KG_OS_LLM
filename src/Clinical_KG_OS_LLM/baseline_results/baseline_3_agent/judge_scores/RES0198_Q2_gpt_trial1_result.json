  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the patient tried OTC decongestants and judged they helped “a little bit,” consistent with [P-10]. It also correctly reports the clinician’s OTC recommendation of “Tylenol cold” per [D-39]. No factual contradictions with the gold answer are present.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core elements asked in the question and present in the gold answer: prior medication (decongestants), perceived effect (“a little bit”), and recommended OTC option (Tylenol Cold). It omits additional supportive-care elements included in the gold answer (hydration, expected duration of a few weeks), though those were not explicitly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are supported by the transcript: decongestants and partial benefit come from [P-10], and Tylenol Cold comes from [D-39]. No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question (what tried, how effective, what recommended) with no meaningful tangents."
