  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the viral infection/common cold diagnosis, both supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold), the COVID swab test with 48-hour results timeframe, and the isolation instructions. The factual content aligns perfectly with what was stated in [D-39] and matches the Gold Answer's information.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components present in the Gold Answer: (1) the working diagnosis of viral infection/common cold, (2) both supportive care recommendations (hydration and OTC medications), (3) the COVID swab test ordered for today with 48-hour results, and (4) isolation guidance while awaiting results. However, it omits two minor details present in the Gold Answer: the expectation that symptoms can take 'a few weeks' to resolve, and the mention that further instructions would come 'from public health' after results return. These are contextual details rather than core management plan elements, representing approximately 10-15% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-39]. The diagnosis statement, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test ordering, and isolation instructions are all explicitly stated by the doctor. The Generated Answer does not introduce any information not present in the source material and accurately reflects what was communicated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly focused on the question asked. It provides a structured breakdown of the complete management plan as communicated at the end of the visit, addressing all four requested components: diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance. There is no irrelevant content or tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and highly relevant response that captures all essential elements of the management plan from [D-39]. It correctly identifies the viral infection diagnosis, both supportive care measures, the COVID swab test, and isolation guidance. The response is well-structured and fully grounded in the transcript. Minor deductions in completeness are due to omitting two contextual details: the expected multi-week symptom duration and the mention of follow-up instructions coming from public health after results."
