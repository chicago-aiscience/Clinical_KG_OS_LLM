  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis the doctor wanted to exclude, correctly states that a COVID swab was ordered, and correctly reports the expected results timeframe of 24–48 hours. These match the Gold Answer without contradiction or added incorrect details.",
    "completeness": "It includes all key elements requested in the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) alternative diagnosis = COVID-19, (2) test = COVID swab, (3) turnaround time = 24–48 hours. No key point is missing.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript at [D-52]. The answer does not introduce additional ungrounded claims (e.g., it does not speculate on which symptoms overlap).",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the three items asked (diagnosis to exclude, test ordered, turnaround time) and contains no tangential material."
