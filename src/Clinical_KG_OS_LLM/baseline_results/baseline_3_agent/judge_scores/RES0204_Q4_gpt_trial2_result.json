  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered and ruled out, consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. It accurately reports the mother’s cited negatives: no shortness of breath and no wheezing, including with physical activity. No factual contradictions or incorrect additions are present.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core elements required by the question and Gold Answer: asthma, positive grandparent history, and the specific symptoms absent even with activity (no SOB, no wheeze). However, it omits supporting details present in the Gold Answer/transcript that further justify ruling it out, especially that he had already “been worked up for that” (prior evaluation) and the mother’s definitive conclusion (“he doesn’t have that”). It also does not include the additional contextual negative from P-24 (generally healthy/never had a dry cough like this before), which the Gold Answer mentions as further distinction.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (P-28) and do not introduce hallucinated findings. The emphasis on symptoms absent during physical activity is explicitly stated by the mother.",
    "relevance": "The response stays tightly focused on the asked condition and the specific clinical negatives (including absence during physical activity) used to rule it out, with no tangential content."
