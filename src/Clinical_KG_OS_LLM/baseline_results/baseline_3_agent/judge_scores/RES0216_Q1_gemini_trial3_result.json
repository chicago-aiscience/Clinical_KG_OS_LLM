  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain denials for fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, or sweating. These symptoms were explicitly denied by the patient in turns P-6, P-12, P-13, P-14, and P-15. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these as pertinent negatives. The first section regarding reported symptoms is accurate, but the second section contains significant factual errors regarding the presence of information in the source text.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to list 6 out of the 8 commonly screened symptoms requested in the prompt (fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating). While it covers the respiratory symptoms and a couple of denials (cough, chest pain), it misses the majority of the pertinent negatives requested and documented in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a failure in faithfulness by claiming that certain information (denials of fevers, etc.) is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present. This is a 'negative hallucination' or a failure to ground the response in the provided dialogue turns.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in its structure, directly attempting to answer both parts of the question (reported symptoms and denials). However, its utility is severely diminished by the false claim that the requested data on denials was unavailable."
