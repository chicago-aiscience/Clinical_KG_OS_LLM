  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies sore throat onset (~4 days) and difficulty swallowing food, and notes a taste change and explicit denial of smell. However, it incorrectly states there were no explicit denials of cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, or fever—these are explicitly denied in the transcript (P-15 to P-18, P-23). It also omits key reported symptoms present in the Gold Answer (notably constant/worsening difficulty breathing starting yesterday, plus fatigue and muscle aches). These are significant factual/interpretive errors relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Reported symptoms: includes sore throat, dysphagia, taste reduction; misses difficulty breathing (onset yesterday, constant, worsening) and fatigue/myalgias (tiredness + muscle aches). Denied symptoms: includes only loss of smell; misses denials of cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills/night sweats (and also misses denial of sick contacts/travel noted in Gold). Overall coverage is well under 50% of key Gold Answer elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Some statements are grounded with correct citations (e.g., sore throat P-2; taste/smell P-19). But the claim that the transcript contains no explicit denials of cough/runny nose/fever/headache/chest pain contradicts clear transcript content (P-15–P-18, P-23). This indicates multiple ungrounded/incorrect assertions relative to the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on symptoms reported and symptoms denied, which is what the question asks. However, because it omits multiple key symptoms and most denials, it only partially addresses the question."
