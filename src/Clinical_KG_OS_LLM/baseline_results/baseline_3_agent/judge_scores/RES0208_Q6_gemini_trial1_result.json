  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the chest X-ray and COVID-19 swab as the ordered tests, the physical exam of the chest, the self-isolation instructions involving the wife and the Public Health Nurse, the 24-48 hour timeline, and the test-result-based admission criteria.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers 100% of the key points requested in the prompt: all diagnostic tests, the physical exam, specific isolation instructions and their sources, the results timeline, and the admission vs. discharge criteria.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in the transcript. There is a minor citation error where the chest X-ray and physical exam are attributed to turn [D-36] instead of [D-37], although both are part of the same instructional block by the doctor.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the question provided, with no irrelevant or off-topic information."
