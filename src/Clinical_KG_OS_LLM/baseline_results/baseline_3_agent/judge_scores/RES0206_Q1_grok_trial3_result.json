  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: respiratory symptoms (increased cough, greenish-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, shortness of breath) match [P-1]; systemic symptoms (feverish/hot [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12]) align; most bothersome symptom (cough [P-12]) is exact. No factual errors or contradictions, though some details like exercise tolerance and headache are omitted (impacts completeness, not correctness). Score: 5",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Respiratory - increased cough [P-1], sputum [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], dyspnea/SOB [P-1], reduced exercise tolerance [P-4]; Systemic - fever [P-9/10/11], sinus pressure [P-12], headache [P-14]; Most bothersome - cough [P-12]. Generated covers cough, sputum, hemoptysis, SOB (80-99% respiratory), fever, sinus (but misses headache), and most bothersome fully. Pertinent negatives not required by question. Covers ~85% of key points. Score: 4",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: increased coughing/sputum/hemoptysis/SOB [P-1], feverish [P-9], sinus pressure/cough most bothersome [P-12]. Descriptions like 'greenish-yellow' and 'small amount of blood' match transcript phrasing closely. No hallucinations or unverifiable details. Score: 5",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by categorizing respiratory (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, SOB) and systemic (fever, sinus) symptoms from 3-day worsening, identifying cough as most bothersome. Structured response with no off-topic content. Score: 5"
