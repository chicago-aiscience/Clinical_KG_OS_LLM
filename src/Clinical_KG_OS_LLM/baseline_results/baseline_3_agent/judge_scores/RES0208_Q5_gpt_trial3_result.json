  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors compared with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It incorrectly asserts that the transcript \"does not contain information\" about the grandson/daycare/cold, travel, or in-person client visits—yet these are explicitly documented at [P-23], [D-24]/[P-24], and [P-31]–[D-32]/[P-32]. It also introduces an external \"knowledge graph\" that is not part of the source. While it correctly notes that the doctor suspected an infection and could not rule out COVID [D-36] and planned a chest X-ray/COVID swab [D-37], it fails the core exposure-history facts and thus is largely incorrect relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed: (1) grandchildren visited last weekend; grandson had a cold and attends daycare [P-23]; (2) doctor explored travel outside the province and it was denied [D-24, P-24]; (3) work exposure explored—financial advisor mostly from home, no in-person client visits for a couple weeks [P-31, D-32, P-32]; (4) conclusion that with travel/occupational exposures excluded, grandson visit is most identifiable exposure supporting suspected infection [D-36]. The Generated Answer includes only the general infection/COVID suspicion and testing plan, omitting nearly all requested exposure-pathway content.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims are directly contradicted by the transcript (e.g., that there is no mention of grandson/daycare/cold, travel, or client visits). The answer also references a \"knowledge graph\" not present in the transcript, adding unsupported content. Although some symptom-based statements are grounded in [P-1], [P-4], [P-11], [D-36], and [D-37], the central exposure-history section is unfaithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response partially addresses suspected infection/COVID assessment and testing, but it does not answer the question’s main focus: how grandson contact relates to suspected infection and which other exposure pathways were explored/excluded. The (incorrect) claim that these exposure pathways are absent makes the answer largely non-responsive to the prompt’s specific requirements."

  "summary": "Although it correctly notes suspected infection/COVID evaluation, the answer is largely incorrect and unfaithful because it denies the explicit exposure history (grandson/daycare/cold, travel, and client visits) that the question asks about."
