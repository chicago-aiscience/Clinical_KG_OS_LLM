  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the transition from productive cough (whitish clear mucus for first 4-5 days, now resolved) to persistent dry cough over two weeks, and chest hurting/soreness when coughing too much, all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript citations [P-2, P-5, P-6, P-15, P-16]. No factual errors or contradictions; however, minor discrepancy in labeling chest issue as 'Chest Pain' while Gold specifies 'soreness' denying independent pain, but patient phrasing supports it. Omissions of other symptoms are not errors but lead to partial match. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: persistent cough 2 weeks; resolved - sore throat (2-3 days), runny nose (couple days), productive cough/mucus (4-5 days), flu symptoms resolved 3-4 days except cough; present - dry cough since day 4-5, 3-4x/hour, spontaneous/no triggers, stable intensity/frequency, chest soreness with excess coughing (no independent pain); pertinent negatives (no SOB, fever, N/V, abd pain). Covered: persistent cough, productive cough resolved (4-5 days), dry cough present, chest pain/soreness with coughing (~4 key points). Missed: sore throat, runny nose, flu symptoms summary, cough frequency/triggers/stability details, pertinent negatives (~70% missed). Covers ~30%, score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: productive mucus first 4-5 days [P-6], persistent cough [P-2], dry now [P-5, P-6], chest hurts with too much coughing [P-15]. Citations accurate [P-6, P-2, P-15]. No hallucinated facts or unverifiable details. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response into resolved and present symptoms, directly listing specifics from transcript matching the question's request for symptoms during two-week illness, resolved vs. still present, with no off-topic content. Score: 5."
