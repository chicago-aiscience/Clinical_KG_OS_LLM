  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with both the transcript and the gold answer. It accurately identifies the shortness of breath, the dry nature of the cough, the timing of the seizure, and the specific temperature recorded.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the primary symptoms but misses several specific details present in the gold answer. Specifically, it omits the 3-hour duration of the shortness of breath, the lack of sputum production, the patient's underlying epilepsy diagnosis, the post-ictal status ('felt fine'), and all pertinent negatives (denial of chest pain, faintness, etc.) which are included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited using the provided tags.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the components of the question (respiratory, neurological, and fever) without including unnecessary information."
