  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition [D-45], the hypothetical presentation (cough or shortness of breath without fever) [D-45], and the excluding finding (fever over 100°F from [P-1]) that led to prioritizing infection [D-45]. All facts match the Gold Answer without contradictions, though it omits additional supporting details like exact temperatures, no wheezing [P-7], and uncertain shortness of breath [P-8]. No factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: condition (asthma), alternative presentation (cough/SOB without fever), excluding finding (fever >100°F), conclusion (infection). Missed: precise temp details (101/100.1°F [P-2]), supporting lacks (no wheezing [P-7], uncertain SOB [P-8]), nuance (not permanently ruled out, prioritized infection). Covers ~85-90% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All core claims verifiable in transcript: asthma, conditions, fever ([P-1], [D-45]), infection conclusion ([D-45]). Citations accurate. Minor unverifiable addition: 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript), but no hallucinated facts about the case.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers the question by specifying the condition (asthma) and excluding finding (fever), with precise citations; no off-topic content."
