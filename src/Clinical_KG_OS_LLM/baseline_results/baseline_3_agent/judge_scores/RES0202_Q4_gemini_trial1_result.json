  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition and the presence of fever (high temperature) as the excluding clinical finding, which aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary key points: the condition (asthma), the hypothetical presentation (cough/shortness of breath without fever), and the actual finding (fever) leading to an infection diagnosis. It misses the secondary supporting details mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the mother not noticing wheezing or shortness of breath.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript, specifically referencing D-45 and P-1. The mention of a 'knowledge graph' is likely a template artifact as none was provided, but the factual claims are all supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question without irrelevant tangents."
