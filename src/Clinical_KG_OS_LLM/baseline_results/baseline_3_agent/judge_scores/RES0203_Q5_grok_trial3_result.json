  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies the hiking trip two weeks ago with partner where 'some people kind of brushed by us' [P-18, P-19] as the specific potential exposure event, explicitly noted by the patient as a possible source ('I don't see where else I could have gotten this from' [P-18]). The Generated Answer incorrectly states the patient 'did not explicitly identify a specific exposure event,' directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript, with no minor discrepancies—this is a fundamental factual error on the core element of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: high school senior attending online [P-36, P-37]; mostly staying home [D-38, P-38]; specific exposure = hiking 2 weeks ago with partner, half-hour away, people brushed by [P-18, P-19]; no other exposures or sick contacts [P-17, P-18]; lives with parents/sibling [P-29]; immunizations up-to-date [P-20]; testing due to symptoms despite limited exposure [D-39]. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead focusing entirely on symptoms (loss of smell/taste, dry cough) and a non-existent 'knowledge graph,' missing all exposure-related points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer accurately cites transcript for symptoms [P-1, P-8, D-39], but hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' linking symptoms to COVID (no KG in provided transcript); incorrectly claims no exposure identified despite clear transcript evidence [P-18, P-19]; pivots to symptoms ungrounded in the question's focus on exposure; multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements present.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks for the 'specific potential exposure event' identified by the patient (hiking) and its connection to COVID suspicion, given homebound status. Generated Answer denies any exposure event exists and shifts entirely to symptom-based reasoning, failing to address the question's core (exposure history) and introducing irrelevant symptom details and 'knowledge graph'."
