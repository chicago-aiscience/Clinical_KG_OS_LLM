  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated plan in [D-37]: (1) a quick physical exam including listening to the heart and lungs, and (2) then getting/consulting the doctor they are working with, reviewing what was discussed, and returning to the patient to discuss next steps. There are no factual contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core required elements asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer: specified exam components (heart/lung auscultation + quick physical exam) and the described process for next steps (consult supervising physician, review discussion, return to patient). It does not include additional contextual points mentioned in the Gold Answer (e.g., that this plan was foreshadowed in [D-1], patient agreement in [P-37], and that no diagnosis/medication was provided at that stage). Those omissions reduce completeness relative to the Gold Answer but do not omit the main requested plan elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, particularly [D-37]. No hallucinated exam components, diagnoses, tests, or treatments are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays tightly focused on the doctor’s end-of-consultation plan, the specified physical exam elements, and the process for determining next steps, which directly answers the question."

  "summary": "Accurate, transcript-grounded, and highly relevant; slightly less complete than the Gold Answer due to omission of added contextual details (foreshadowing in D-1, patient agreement, and noting no diagnosis/medication yet)."
