  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three symptom domains (smell change, taste change, mild dry cough) and that the cough is dry and consistent. However, it misrepresents the taste symptom as a complete loss (“lost my sense of taste”) when the transcript clarifies it was partial (can taste very salty foods but not normal foods, e.g., banana). It also omits several correct specifics from the gold answer (two-day duration, partial smell with ability to detect very bad odors, nonproductive/no sputum or blood, started same time as sensory symptoms, no triggers), which impacts overall factual alignment with the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "Key gold points covered: (1) decreased smell, (2) taste issue, (3) mild dry cough, (4) cough described as consistent.\nKey gold points missed: (1) symptom duration of two days, (2) smell loss described as partial with specific preserved perception of very strong unpleasant odors, (3) taste loss described as partial with preserved ability to taste very salty foods and inability to taste normal foods (banana example), (4) sensory deficits consistent over two days, (5) cough nonproductive with no sputum/blood, (6) cough started at same time as sensory symptoms, (7) no triggers identified. Overall, it covers the broad categories but misses most of the requested “degree” and perceptual details.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are drawn from the transcript (P-1 for smell/taste/cough; P-8 for cough consistency). However, presenting taste as a simple/complete “loss” is not faithful to the fuller clarification at P-4 that indicates partial taste ability. No clear hallucinated symptoms are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on sensory (smell/taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms, which is what the question asks. However, it does not adequately address the requested degree (partial vs complete) and the patient’s specific preserved vs lost perceptions, so it is only mostly relevant rather than fully responsive."
