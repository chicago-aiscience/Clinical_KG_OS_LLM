  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the same triad of symptoms (dry cough worsening over days with citations P-1, P-5; fever over 100°F/100.1-101°F with P-1, P-2; possible loss of taste with P-17) as the Gold Answer. It correctly quotes and interprets D-44 on alignment with COVID symptoms (despite transcript's 'allowed with' likely a typo for 'aligned') and D-45 on fever distinguishing infection from asthma. No factual errors or contradictions; minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'patient reported' vs. parent) but core facts identical.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points: exact triad symptoms with similar/worse progression (3 days in Gold via P-12, 2+ days in Gen); fever details; taste change; D-44 COVID alignment; D-45 fever leading to infectious conclusion over asthma; mentions systemic elements like appetite loss (implied in both). 100% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-1, P-2, P-5, P-17, D-44, D-45). Quotes transcript verbatim where possible (e.g., fever readings, 'allowed with', D-45 partial quote). No hallucinations; reduced appetite from P-15/P-17 context; cough details from multiple Ps. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the question's specified combination (respiratory complaint, temperature, taste change) as a triad, then explains doctor's collective use for COVID alignment (D-44) and infectious conclusion via fever differentiation (D-45). No tangents; perfectly focused."
