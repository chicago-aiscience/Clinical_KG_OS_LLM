  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript and gold answer regarding the core timeline events (teen anxiety, recent stress, and onset of chest pain). However, it misses specific details like the age at which she started smoking (18) and the significant detail of her father's recent heart attack, which is a key part of her history and current concern.",
    "completeness": "The response covers the main phases but omits several key points from the gold answer: it doesn't mention the starting age of 18 for smoking, the specific escalation to 10 cigarettes per day over the last two years, the father's heart attack, or the relationship detail regarding symptoms being more noticeable when the patient is alone versus distracted.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript, though it repeatedly references an external 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source text. Most of the clinical information it attributes to this graph is actually present in the transcript (like the heart fluttering or smoking history), but the reference itself is a slight hallucination of source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request to trace the timeline and explain the relationships between the phases. It maintains a clinical and chronological focus throughout."
