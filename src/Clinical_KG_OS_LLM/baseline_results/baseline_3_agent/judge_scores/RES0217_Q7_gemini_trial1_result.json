{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the timeline (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening, discovery behind the knee), the prior history (10 years ago, bullseye rash, antibiotics), and the specific comparison of tick engorgement (current is small/less swollen vs. past was quite swollen).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key points required by the prompt. It addresses the timeline of activities, the discovery of the tick, the comparison of local symptoms (redness/tenderness vs. bullseye rash), and the comparison of tick engorgement. It also includes the doctor's 72-hour estimation which was in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical and narrative claims are grounded in the transcript. However, there is a stray citation tag '[KG]' in the second point of the timeline section that does not correspond to the transcript or gold answer, which appears to be a minor hallucination of a citation format.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to directly answer both parts of the complex prompt (timeline and comparison)."
