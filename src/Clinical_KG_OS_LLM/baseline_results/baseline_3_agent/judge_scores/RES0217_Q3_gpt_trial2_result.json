  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the key driver cited by the clinician: an estimated attachment duration “longer than at least 72 hours” based on hiking Friday and gardening Saturday [D-6, P-1]. It also correctly notes the prior episode ~10 years ago with a “target/bullseye” rash treated with antibiotics [P-3], and that there was no current bullseye rash while prophylaxis was still recommended.\n\nHowever, it introduces at least one clinically meaningful inference not supported by the transcript: that the prior history “confirms the patient is susceptible” and that their body “reacted similarly,” which the clinician did not state. It also overstates the role of “current localized symptoms” as a reason for prophylaxis; the transcript frames prophylaxis primarily around duration and risk context, not local tenderness.\n\nOverall, the core factual basis is mostly right, with some unsupported/overinterpreted claims.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: \n- Exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertain when acquired) (partially covered; uncertainty not explicitly emphasized).\n- Attachment duration estimated >72 hours and used to justify prophylaxis (covered well).\n- Prior tick bite with bullseye/target rash and antibiotics (covered).\n\nKey Gold Answer elements missed or under-specified:\n- Specific geographic risk assessment: Strathroy along the creek, clinician checked Ontario Lyme map and deemed it “close enough…concerning” [P-12, D-13] (not included; replaced by generic habitat discussion).\n- Patient’s statement that “lately… they’ve been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme” [P-5] (not included).\n- Plan to send the tick to a lab for definitive species identification [D-6] (not included).\n- The clinician’s explicit “safer than not” framing tied to duration/geography (partly included via [D-18], but not linked to the Strathroy map finding).\n\nThis is roughly 50–79% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript:\n- References to a “knowledge graph” and claims that hiking/gardening are linked in the knowledge graph (not in transcript).\n- The inference that prior Lyme-like illness “confirms susceptibility” (not stated).\n\nMost other claims are supported with transcript citations (e.g., >72 hours, local redness/tenderness, prior bullseye rash). Because there are multiple non-transcript additions, faithfulness is moderate rather than high.",
    "relevance": "The response generally addresses the question (why prophylactic antibiotics were recommended despite non-deer-tick appearance and no current bullseye rash) and stays on the topic of exposure, duration, geography, and prior history. Minor distractions include the “knowledge graph” mention and overemphasis on local tenderness as a deciding factor."

  "summary": "Captures the main rationale (exposure timing implying >72h and prior bullseye-rash history) but omits the specific Strathroy/map-based geographic risk and adds some unsupported inferences (\"knowledge graph,\" \"susceptibility\"), reducing completeness and faithfulness."
