  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies Ventolin and Spiriva as current respiratory inhalers, Ventolin used ~10 times past week [P-11,P-12], atorvastatin (Torva Staten) as current non-respiratory med [P-38,D-39], and discontinued diuretic for BP without approval [P-35,P-36]. Generated correctly identifies Spiriva and Ventolin (misspelled Ventilin) as current inhalers but misses Ventolin frequency (claims no specific number despite [P-12]), wrongly lists diuretic as current non-respiratory med (P-34/P-35 indicate discontinued), and completely omits atorvastatin. Discontinued med is correctly identified as diuretic without approval. Significant errors in current vs past meds and Ventolin use make it score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: two inhalers (covered), Ventolin 10x/week (missed), atorvastatin current (missed), diuretic prior/discontinued (partially covered but misclassified as current). Covers inhalers and discontinued med but misses frequency and one current med, plus misplaces diuretic; ~50% coverage, score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Spiriva/Ventolin from [P-11] accurate; Ventolin 'lot more' from [P-11] but ignores specific 10x from [P-12]; diuretic cited [P-35] but transcript [P-34/P-35] shows past use ('used to take...don't right now'), so hallucinates as current; no atorva mention. Multiple misinterpretations/hallucinations on med status, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to question parts (existing meds split by type, Ventolin freq, discontinued med) with citations; fully on-topic despite errors, score 4."
