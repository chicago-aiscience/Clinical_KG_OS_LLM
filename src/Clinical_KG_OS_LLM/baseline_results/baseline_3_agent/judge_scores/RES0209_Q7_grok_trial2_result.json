  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details diagnosis at age 8 (now 10), baseline bronchodilator use once every two weeks, triggers (exercise, cold, seasonal), two-week exacerbation with nonstop dry cough, increased wheezing, SOB, chest tightness, bronchodilator 5-6 times/week (wheezing more frequent), nighttime symptoms, no precipitant. Generated Answer omits diagnosis age/history, baseline frequency, exact current frequency, exacerbation duration (says one week vs two), nighttime symptoms, wheezing frequency exceeding use; incorrectly cites chest tightness response to [P-4] instead of [P-20]; adds unsubstantiated 'diagnosis of asthma exacerbation' and '[Knowledge Graph]'; core escalation noted but significant factual discrepancies and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: escalation in symptoms (cough, wheezing, SOB), some triggers (cold, exercise, spring/pollen), increased bronchodilator use (vaguely). Missed: diagnosis at age 8/now 10, baseline 'once every two weeks', current 'five-six times a week', two-week duration, wheezing more than bronchodilator use, nighttime symptoms every other day, no precipitant identified. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most symptom claims verifiable (cough/SOB [P-1], wheezing [P-15], triggers [P-9,P-11]); chest tightness response mis-cited as [P-4] (actual [P-20]); bronchodilator increase referenced vaguely ([P-1], not precise [P-8]); hallucinations include 'diagnosis of asthma exacerbation' (not stated), '[Knowledge Graph] inference' (absent), family history added though minor. Multiple unverifiable additions and citation error.",
    "relevance": "Addresses current symptoms and bronchodilator increase somewhat relevant to evolution question, but lacks structure/timeline from initial diagnosis/baseline to exacerbation; includes off-topic elements like family history and inferred diagnosis; partially on-topic with tangents."
