  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three medications (salbutamol for asthma, Ramipril for high blood pressure, Tylenol for headaches) matching the Gold Answer, but incorrectly states that the transcript 'does not contain specific information detailing changes to dosing frequency or adherence over the past couple of years,' which directly contradicts the Gold Answer's detailed summary of adherence changes (e.g., skipping evening dose of daily inhaler [P-19], no refill of rescue inhaler for couple of years [P-17,P-18]). It also misrepresents the doctor's suggestion [D-35] as a past change rather than a future plan and cites incorrect transcript reference for Tylenol ([P-26] instead of [P-27]). Significant factual errors on the core adherence question make this a 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points covered: three medications and their indications (100% covered). Key adherence points missed entirely: daily inhaler prescribed morning/night but self-skipping evening dose for 'a while' and now only morning [P-19,P-20]; no rescue inhaler refilled in couple of years, none available [P-17,P-18]; justification of no problems with reduced dose. Generated Answer covers 0% of adherence changes, focusing instead on symptoms and future plans. Approximately 30-40% coverage (meds only), score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like 'transcript does not contain specific information detailing changes' are unverifiable and false, as [P-17-P20] detail exact changes. Introduces ungrounded 'Knowledge Graph' references not in transcript. Doctor's future suggestion [D-35] is twisted into past regimen inadequacy (plausible but hallucinated interpretation). Minor citation error ([P-26] for Tylenol). Multiple ungrounded or incorrect claims, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Addresses medications and indications directly (relevant). Fails to address past adherence changes specifically requested (dosing frequency, rescue availability over years), instead discussing symptoms [P-1,P-16], recurrence suspicion [D-35], and future plans (off-topic tangents). Partially relevant, score 3."
