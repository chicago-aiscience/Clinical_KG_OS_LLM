  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the COVID-19 swab order [D-53], self-isolation for patient and husband [D-53], and references further investigation [D-53], all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript; no factual errors or contradictions, though it omits some details like physical exam and consulting the supervising doctor.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) COVID-19 swab (covered); 2) self-isolation for patient and husband (covered fully); 3) physical exam as next step [D-52] (missed); 4) consult supervising doctor and return [D-55] (missed); 5) patient agreement (missed). Covers ~50% of key points (test and precautions fully, next steps vaguely).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about swab, isolation, and further workup are directly verifiable in [D-53]; citations accurate; minor unverifiable addition of 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript), but no hallucinated facts about the plan.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around the question's elements (test ordered, precautionary measures for patient/husband, next steps), with no off-topic content."
