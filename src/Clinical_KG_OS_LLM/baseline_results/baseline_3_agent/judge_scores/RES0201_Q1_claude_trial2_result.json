  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and omissions. It correctly identifies sore throat, swallowing difficulties, and taste issues, but critically MISSES difficulty breathing (a major symptom mentioned in P-7, P-8, P-9, P-10) and fatigue/muscle aches (P-25, P-26). More problematically, it falsely claims 'the transcript contains no explicit statements denying cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, or chest pain' when the Gold Answer correctly cites P-15 (no cough), P-16 (no runny nose), P-17 (no headaches), P-18 (no chest pain), and P-23 (no fever). The Generated Answer only acknowledges denial of loss of smell, missing multiple other explicit denials.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 50% of the key points. It identifies 3 of 4 main symptoms (missing difficulty breathing entirely) and only 1 of 7 explicit denials (loss of smell only, missing cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills/night sweats). It also omits the timeline details and progression information that are present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a significant factually incorrect claim that contradicts the transcript. It states there are 'no explicit statements denying cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, or chest pain' when these denials are clearly present in P-15, P-16, P-17, P-18, and P-23. However, the symptoms it does report (sore throat, swallowing issues, taste changes) are accurately grounded in the transcript with correct citations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about reported symptoms and denied symptoms, staying on topic throughout. However, it provides an incomplete and partially incorrect response to what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question but has critical deficiencies. It correctly identifies some reported symptoms (sore throat, swallowing difficulties, taste changes) with proper citations, but completely misses difficulty breathing—a major symptom. Most problematically, it makes a factually incorrect claim that explicit denials of common symptoms (cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, chest pain) are not present in the transcript, when they clearly are (P-15 through P-18, P-23). This represents both a factual error and a failure to complete the task. The answer is relevant to the question but achieves only about 40% completeness and contains significant accuracy issues."
