  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core facts: the two-day duration, simultaneous onset of all three symptoms, and the lack of worsening or fluctuation. However, it states there is 'no mention' of prior symptoms, whereas the transcript contains an explicit denial ('No, no, nothing like this'). It also omits the detail from the gold answer regarding the partial nature of the sensory loss (e.g., ability to smell strong odors/taste salt).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main points (onset timing, simultaneity, lack of progression, and prior history). However, it misses several nuanced details included in the Gold Answer: the partial nature of the sensory loss, the specific confirmation of consistency for sensory symptoms (focusing only on the cough), and the doctor's concluding remark about COVID-19 consistency.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The phrasing regarding 'no mention' of prior history is a slightly weak interpretation of a direct denial, but it is not a hallucination of a fact.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific sub-questions asked (timing, progression, and history)."
