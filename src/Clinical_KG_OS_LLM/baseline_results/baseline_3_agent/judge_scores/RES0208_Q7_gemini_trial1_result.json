  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript. However, it miscategorizes the 'Loss of Taste' symptom. The prompt specifically asked for symptoms that appeared 'more recently (such as... the loss of taste that morning)' as a separate category from those 'only just beginning to emerge at the time of the consultation.' The generated answer grouped the loss of taste into the third category instead of the second. Core clinical facts remain accurate.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: generalized body aches (achy), diminished sense of smell, and headaches. It also misses the specific description of breathing as 'laborious'. It covers the main symptoms (SOB, fatigue, fever, taste, cough, sore throat) but lacks the exhaustive detail of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, using direct quotes and correct speaker tags (e.g., [P-1], [D-36]). There are no hallucinations or external information added beyond the knowledge graph mention which doesn't distort the facts.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request to reconstruct the timeline using the three requested phases. It is focused and provides clear sections for each period, though it ignored the prompt's hint regarding where to place the loss of taste symptom."
