  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the clinician concluded a viral URI/common cold [D-39] and uses symptom duration (~1 week) and symptom evolution (stuffy → mostly runny) [P-3] as supportive. However, it weakens accuracy by overinterpreting/adding rationale not in the Gold Answer/transcript (e.g., contrasts with “rapid-resolution allergic reaction” and “sudden onset of bacterial infection”), and it omits key discriminators that were central in the Gold Answer (clear discharge, absence of fever/cough, lack of exposures). It also leans on a “Knowledge Graph,” which is not part of the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key supports: (1) absence of cough and systemic/lower respiratory symptoms (no cough [P-4], no sore throat/SOB/fever/chills [P-7], no post-nasal drip [P-6]); (2) clear discharge [P-5]; (3) 1-week duration and typical viral course/doctor noting a few weeks [D-39]; (4) progression stuffy → runny [P-3]; (5) against allergies: no fume/dust/animal exposure [P-22], no allergies [P-28], no similar recent episodes [P-9]; (6) against bacterial: no fever [P-7], no headache [P-14], not colored discharge [P-5]; (7) daycare exposure [P-11]. Generated Answer covers (3) and (4), and partially (general symptom type), but misses most of (1), (2), (5), (6), and (7).",
    "faithfulness": "Some statements are grounded (stuffy/runny nose and duration [P-1, P-2], evolution [P-3], doctor’s conclusion [D-39]). But it introduces non-transcript content: reference to a “Knowledge Graph,” and claims like ‘both symptoms indicate viral illness’ and comparative statements about allergy/bacterial course that are not explicitly supported by the visit transcript. Overall, multiple elements are not verifiable from the provided source.",
    "relevance": "It stays on-topic (evidence for viral vs other causes) but does not directly address several requested contrasts (why not allergic, why not bacterial) using the specific absent features/exposure history emphasized in the question and Gold Answer."
