  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s main conclusion (these symptoms + increased reliever use indicate worsening asthma/asthma exacerbation) aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it contains multiple factual/citation errors: it attributes the patient’s confirmation of chest tightness to [P-4] and [P-9], but chest tightness is confirmed at [P-20]. It also cites [P-9] for the change from once every two weeks to 5–6 times/week, but that frequency change is at [P-8] (while [P-9] is about triggers). It also calls the symptom set a “triad” while listing four symptoms. The “knowledge graph” section is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer and therefore is not correct/grounded in the provided material.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: dry cough, shortness of breath, wheeze, chest tightness; bronchodilator helps; increased bronchodilator use (conceptually); exercise/cold as triggers (mentioned). Key points missed: explicit reference to known asthma diagnosis since age 8 supporting this being worsening of existing asthma; wheezing occurring even more frequently than bronchodilator use (D-17/P-17); the clinician’s negative infectious screen (no URI symptoms/sick contacts/travel/fever/anosmia, etc.); non-productive cough detail (no “gunk”). Overall coverage is partial (~50–70%).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or are incorrectly supported by the transcript: the “knowledge graph provided” is entirely absent (hallucinated context). Multiple citations are wrong (chest tightness and bronchodilator-frequency change). While many general claims are consistent with the transcript, these issues represent more than minor unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The response mostly focuses on the asked symptom combination and increased bronchodilator use as evidence of worsening asthma. The “knowledge graph” discussion is a mild tangent and not needed, but it does not substantially derail the answer."
