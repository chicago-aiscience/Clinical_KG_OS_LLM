  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states the pain is 'consistently localized in the chest' and 'feels the same each time' using a misattributed citation [P-1] which is the doctor's statement, not the patient's description. Most critically, it completely misrepresents the triggers and resolution: the transcript clearly shows pain occurs when ALONE (walking/studying) and resolves when WITH PEOPLE or engaged in activities [P-4, P-9, P-29], but the Generated Answer claims pain occurs 'only if having an anxiety attack' [P-20] which is about heart fluttering, not chest pain. The quality description omits key details like 'sharp, strong pain when taking a deep breath' [P-3] and 'uncomfortable/odd' initial characterization [P-2].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses multiple key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the one and a half week duration of overall symptoms, (2) the initial 'uncomfortable/odd' characterization before 'sharp, strong pain' clarification, (3) pain specifically with deep breathing, (4) pain occurs while sitting/studying and walking to school, (5) pain resolves when talking to people or doing hands-on tasks at school, (6) pain can occur at rest, (7) no worsening with exercise/walking, (8) intermittent episodes 'here and there' throughout the day, (9) no preceding injury, (10) no prior occurrence before this episode. The answer covers only the 20-minute duration correctly and vaguely mentions stress but fundamentally mischaracterizes the occurrence/resolution pattern.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple hallucinations and misattributions. Citation [P-1] is misused (it's the patient saying 'Chest pain' in response to doctor). The claim that pain occurs 'only if having an anxiety attack' [P-20] is a fabrication - P-20 discusses heart fluttering, not chest pain. The statement about pain being 'exclusive to episodes of anxiety attacks' directly contradicts the transcript where the patient clearly states pain occurs when walking to school and studying alone [P-4, P-29]. The answer fabricates a causal relationship between anxiety attacks and the chest pain that is not supported by the transcript. The claim about 'Relief from Management' section is accurate but presented out of context as if relevant to resolution.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question about quality, duration, and situations of occurrence/resolution, but provides largely incorrect information. While it does identify the 20-minute duration correctly, the quality description is incomplete and the situations of occurrence/resolution are fundamentally wrong. The inclusion of stress/anxiety discussion is tangentially relevant but misrepresents the actual triggers. The medications section, while factually accurate, is not directly relevant to the question about pain characteristics and situations."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It contains major factual errors, particularly in mischaracterizing when the pain occurs (claiming it's during anxiety attacks rather than when alone/walking/studying) and when it resolves (omitting the key detail about resolution when engaged with people). The answer misses most key points from the Gold Answer including the initial symptom characterization, pain with deep breathing, specific triggers, and resolution patterns. Multiple claims are either hallucinated or based on misattributed citations, fundamentally contradicting the source transcript. While the 20-minute duration is correctly identified, the overall response fails to accurately represent the patient's chest pain characteristics as described in the consultation."
