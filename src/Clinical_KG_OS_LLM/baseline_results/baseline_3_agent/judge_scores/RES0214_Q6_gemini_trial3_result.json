    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the specific test (COVID-19 swab) and the isolation requirements for both the patient and husband, matching the gold answer's primary facts.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two specific next steps mentioned in the Gold Answer: the immediate physical examination mentioned in [D-52] and the clinician's plan to consult with the attending physician ('the Doctor') before returning [D-55]. It provides a generic summary ('Further investigation') instead of these specific actions.",

    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and follows the requested structure, although the section on 'next steps' lacks the specificity of the source text."
