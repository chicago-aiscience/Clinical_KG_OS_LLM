  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and omissions compared to the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states that the transcript 'does not explicitly state whether the chest tightness has been getting better, worse, or staying the same' when the patient clearly states 'I think it's staying the same' [P-2] and 'it's been pretty steady' [P-3]. It also misattributes information to [D-36] that should reference patient statements, and fails to mention the patient first noticed symptoms while walking [P-4], that symptoms are 'kind of always there' [P-9], and that the patient reduced walks from multiple per day to just one [P-22].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: the three-day duration, chest tightness on breathing, and walking as a trigger. However, it completely omits: the specific activity when symptoms first appeared (walking), the 'staying the same' progression, that symptoms are constantly present but exacerbated by activity, getting up from a chair and deep breaths as triggers, the specific reduction from multiple walks to one walk daily, no missed work time, and the discussion about functional impact being noticeable but not dramatically impairing.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript does not state the progression of symptoms when this is explicitly addressed in [P-2] and [P-3]. The citation to [D-36] is misleading - this refers to the doctor's summary, not the patient's direct statement about breathlessness. The mention of 'increased hoarseness and phlegm' [P-11] is accurate but not relevant to the specific question asked. Most other claims are verifiable in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question. It covers onset timing and walking as a trigger, but fails to adequately address: what the patient was doing when symptoms first appeared (only mentions walking triggers symptoms, not that symptoms were first noticed during a walk), the trend over time (incorrectly claims this isn't stated), specific activities beyond walking that exacerbate symptoms, and the detailed impact on daily walking routine (reduction from multiple walks to one). Approximately 50% of the question components are meaningfully addressed."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It contains a major factual error by claiming symptom progression isn't stated when it clearly is [P-2, P-3]. It covers only about 40-50% of key points from the Gold Answer, omitting crucial details about initial activity, constant baseline symptoms, multiple exacerbating factors, and the specific reduction in daily walks. While most claims are verifiable, the faithfulness is compromised by the false statement about missing information and a misleading citation. The answer only partially addresses the multi-part question, missing important aspects about symptom evolution and functional impact. Overall, this represents a below-average response that would require substantial revision to adequately answer the clinical question."
