  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemic) and the primary reasons provided by the doctor in the transcript (lack of pain, presence of tightness rather than breathlessness). This is fully consistent with the core facts of the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the main points cited in the doctor's summary in D-36. However, it misses the additional 'associated cardiac red flags' mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of anxiety, sweating, and the feeling of impending doom, which were screened earlier in the encounter (D-6).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, accurately quoting the doctor's reasoning in D-36 and the patient's descriptions in P-1 and P-5.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question (the condition and the specific symptom findings)."
