  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states the mother 'did not report' any sick contacts at school when she explicitly said 'not like outside of school' (P-38), meaning there WERE no sick contacts outside school but school contacts were uncertain. It also incorrectly claims the mother 'did not report' school notification when she clearly stated 'they haven't like contacted us about anything' (P-39). The timeline details are mostly correct but the sick contacts section contradicts the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50% of key points. It addresses the timeline of symptoms starting after school and the suspected school source, but completely misses critical information: (1) the mother's explicit statement about no sick contacts outside school, (2) the school's lack of notification about exposures, (3) the school's COVID test requirement for return, (4) the absence of travel history, and (5) the absence of environmental exposures. The answer provides less detail than the Gold Answer on these crucial elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer has major faithfulness issues. It misrepresents what the mother said about sick contacts and school notification. The claim that she 'did not report' these things is false - she explicitly addressed both topics (P-38, P-39, P-41). The reference to 'knowledge graph' and 'asthma' appears to be hallucinated content not grounded in the evaluation task. The timeline information is grounded in the transcript, but the interpretation of sick contacts is not faithful to what was actually said.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is partially relevant. It attempts to address all three components of the question (school attendance as factor, sick contacts, school notification), but provides incorrect or incomplete information for each. The timeline connecting school attendance to illness onset is relevant, but the sections on sick contacts and school notification fail to properly address what was asked. Some content about viral illness symptoms is tangential to the specific question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant factual errors in interpreting the mother's statements about sick contacts and school notifications, directly contradicting information clearly stated in the transcript (P-38, P-39). While it correctly identifies the timeline of symptom onset after school attendance, it fails to capture key details including: the explicit statement about no sick contacts outside school, the school's lack of exposure notification, the COVID test requirement for return, and the absence of travel/environmental factors. The answer shows poor faithfulness with misrepresentation of direct quotes and possible hallucinated content. Coverage is incomplete at approximately 50% of Gold Answer key points, and relevance is compromised by incorrect information despite attempting to address all parts of the question."
