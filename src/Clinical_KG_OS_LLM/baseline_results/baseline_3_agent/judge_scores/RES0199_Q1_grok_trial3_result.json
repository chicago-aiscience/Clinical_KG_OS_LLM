  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer specifies dry cough with no sputum/blood (P-12, P-13), stable (P-11); diarrhea 2 days ago, liquid stools 5-6x/day, no blood (P-28, P-29); vomiting 2 episodes yesterday, food contents no blood (P-32-34); headache 7/10 persistent bilateral forehead/top, no radiation/stiffness (P-3-8); negatives and extras like loss of smell. Generated Answer misses dry nature of cough (incorrectly cites P-11 for nature instead of P-12), claims no diarrhea frequency despite P-28 explicitly stating 'five or six times a day', vague onsets ('few days back' vs precise), no 7/10 severity for headache (vague 'persistent/constant/really sick'), omits many details/negatives. Significant factual discrepancies and omissions vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: cough onset (partial), vomiting 2 episodes (yes), headache onset/persistent (partial). Missed: cough dry/no sputum/blood/stable/negatives (SOB/wheeze/chest pain), diarrhea precise onset/frequency/liquid/no blood/negatives, vomiting timing/details/negatives, nausea precise, headache location/7/10/no rad/stiff/unusual, smell/fatigue. Covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly grounded but errors: denies diarrhea frequency exists despite P-28; attributes cough 'nature' to P-11 (stability, not nature - dry is P-12); headache severity inferred vaguely without citing P-8 (7/10); no fabrications but multiple inaccurate transcript interpretations and omissions of verifiable facts. Multiple issues with verification.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around GI (diarrhea/nausea/vomiting), respiratory (cough), headache symptoms/severity as per question; no off-topic content, focused despite incompleteness."
