  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: patient takes salbutamol (asthma), ramipril (HTN), occasional Tylenol (headache). Asthma adherence: prescribed maintenance inhaler BID but has been skipping the evening dose “for a while,” now only morning; and has not refilled/does not currently have a rescue inhaler because he hasn’t needed it for a couple of years.\n\nGenerated answer: correctly lists salbutamol for asthma, ramipril for high blood pressure, and Tylenol for headaches (though it cites the wrong line for Tylenol). However, it incorrectly states the transcript does not contain information about dosing-frequency/adherence changes over the past couple of years, directly contradicting [P-19] (skipping night dose) and [P-17, P-18] (no rescue inhaler refills for a couple of years). It also reframes the rescue inhaler issue as a new provider “prescribing a specific adjustment,” rather than accurately describing the patient’s current lack of rescue inhaler availability and prior long-term non-refill. These are significant factual/interpretive errors about what changed and when.",
    "completeness": "Included: the three current medications and their general indications.\n\nMissed key gold points: (1) the maintenance inhaler is prescribed twice daily; (2) the patient has been self-reducing/halving to once daily (morning only) for some time; (3) rationale (felt he didn’t need it/doing well); (4) no rescue inhaler currently available because he didn’t refill it; (5) timeframe explicitly “a couple of years” without rescue use/refills; (6) clinician confirmation he did not stop the daily inhaler in the last 3 days. Overall, it omits most adherence-change details requested.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated reliance on an external “knowledge graph” not provided in the source, and the claim that the transcript lacks information on adherence changes (it does contain this information). Some statements are grounded (e.g., doctor suggesting rescue puffers on walks [D-35]), but key assertions conflict with the transcript, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to answer medications/indications and inhaler adherence/rescue availability, which is on-topic. However, it largely fails to address the core adherence-change components explicitly asked (dose frequency change and rescue inhaler non-availability over the past couple of years), so it is only partially responsive."
