{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and consistent with the transcript and gold answer. It correctly identifies the four-day timeline, the initial symptoms (headache and cough), the timing of the loss of smell (one day ago), and the stability of the cough. It accurately notes the presence of GI symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses some specific temporal details present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it misses the patient's explicit statement that the diarrhea began '2 days ago' [P-28], opting instead for the more general 'few days back' from [P-1]. It also misses the patient's direct confirmation that the headache severity 'stayed around the same' [P-9], though it mentions it was 'persistent'.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using direct quotes and correct turn citations. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the question: the four-day course, initial symptoms, timing of GI/smell symptoms, and the progression of the headache/cough."
