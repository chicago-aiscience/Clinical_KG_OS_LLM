  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer and transcript: (1) assessment that symptoms align with COVID-19 [D-43]; (2) plan for COVID swab and chest X-ray [D-43]; (3) isolate until results return [D-43]; and (4) continue isolation even if negative if symptoms persist [D-43]. No contradictions or factual errors noted.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: COVID-consistent symptom assessment, COVID swab, chest X-ray, isolate until results, and continued isolation if still symptomatic despite negative result. Elements from the Gold Answer not included: that this was framed as a “heads up,” that the clinician would confer with the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps [D-1, D-44], and that the patient acknowledged/agreed [P-43, P-44]. Overall coverage is high but not total.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by [D-43]. It does not introduce unsupported diagnoses, additional tests, or extra isolation criteria. No hallucinations detected.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses what was asked: overall assessment, specific diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, and the condition for continued isolation after test results. No meaningful tangents."
