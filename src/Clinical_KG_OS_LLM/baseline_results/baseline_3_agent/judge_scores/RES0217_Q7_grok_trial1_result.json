  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely factually consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly outlines the timeline (hiking Friday [P-1], gardening Saturday [P-1], >72 hours attachment [D-6], discovery behind left knee and presentation with tick in container [P-1]). Comparison covers prior bullseye rash, antibiotics, swollen tick ~10 years ago [P-3]; current less severe, smaller tick [P-3/P-4], local redness/tenderness no rash [P-6]. Minor discrepancies: omits patient's uncertainty/hope it was from hiking not garden [P-1]; misphrases comparison as tick 'not looking like past one referring to rash' (actually separate tick swelling vs rash); misses doctor's 'grape' confirmation [D-4]; includes hallucinated [KG]. Core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: hiking Fri, gardening Sat [P-1]; discovery soreness back knee, removed container [P-1]; >72hrs [D-6]; prior ~10yr bullseye rash/abx, swollen tick [P-3]; current small tick/not much engorged [P-3/4], local red/tender no circle rash [P-6]. Missed/partial: Strathroy location [P-12]; explicit 'earlier today' discovery timing and soreness prompt [P-1]; patient's hope origin hiking not garden [P-1]; doctor's engorgement details [D-4]. Covers ~85-90% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable: timeline/activities [P-1], duration [D-6], location/symptoms [P-1/P-6], prior history/comparison [P-3], tick size [P-4]. Citations accurate except hallucinated [KG] (not in transcript). 'Manageable' interpretive but plausible from 'not as bad' [P-3]. No major fabrications; minor unverifiable interpretive phrasing.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question on timeline (hiking Fri -> gardening Sat -> discovery/presentation) and comparison (current local symptoms/small engorgement vs prior rash/swollen tick/abx). Structured response focused, no off-topic content."
