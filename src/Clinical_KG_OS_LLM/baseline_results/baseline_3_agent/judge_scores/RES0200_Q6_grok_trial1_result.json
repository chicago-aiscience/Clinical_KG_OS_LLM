  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures all major elements of the Gold Answer's description of the management plan, including labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs), imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (O2 saturation, COVID swab), and therapeutics (steroids, antibiotics, supplemental O2 if needed, continuation of bronchodilators with specific names from transcript). Minor discrepancies: categorizes COVID swab under monitoring instead of labs; omits blood pressure monitoring from [D-37]; slight misspelling of 'Ventilin' (transcript variant of Ventolin). Core facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key Gold points: labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs; COVID swab included), chest X-ray, O2 saturation and supp O2, bronchodilators continuation (with specifics), steroids, antibiotics. Misses only the blood pressure monitoring noted in Gold from [D-37], which is a minor additional point (~90% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: labs/imaging/therapeutics from [D-52]; bronchodilator names from [P-11]. No hallucinations, accurate citations, fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured and focused on the question's request for comprehensive plan components (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics including specified items), no off-topic content."
