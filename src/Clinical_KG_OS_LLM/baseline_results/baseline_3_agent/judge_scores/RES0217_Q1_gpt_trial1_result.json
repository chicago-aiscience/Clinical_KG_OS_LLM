  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The local symptom portion is largely accurate (redness, tenderness, localized skin soreness not the joint), and the cited turns generally support these statements. However, the generated answer is factually wrong about systemic screening: the transcript clearly shows the doctor screened for joint pain (D-7), fever/feeling ill (D-8), and headaches (D-19), all denied by the patient (P-7, P-8, P-19/P-20). Stating the doctor did not explicitly screen for these is a major contradiction of the source and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: localized redness, tenderness, soreness of skin/area rather than joint. Key elements missing: (1) location detail (crease behind left knee where it bends) and that the tick was “stuck pretty good”; (2) explicit denial of bullseye/target rash or “larger circle rash”; (3) the full set of systemic symptoms screened and denied (joint pain, fever/feeling ill, headaches). Overall, it misses a substantial portion of required content, especially the systemic component central to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded and correctly cited for local symptoms. However, the claim that the doctor did not screen for fever/joint pain/headache is directly contradicted by the transcript (D-7/D-8/D-19). The mention of a “knowledge graph” is also not supported by the transcript. These issues reduce faithfulness significantly.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address both local and systemic symptoms, which is on-topic. But it fails to provide the requested systemic denials and instead asserts they are not present in the transcript, so it only partially addresses the question."
