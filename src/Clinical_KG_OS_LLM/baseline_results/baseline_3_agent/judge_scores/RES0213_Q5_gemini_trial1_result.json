  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three main factors (family history, smoking, and stress). However, it consistently misgenders the patient (using 'he'/'his' instead of 'she'/'her' as established in the Gold Answer). Furthermore, it incorrectly cites a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source of clinical facts, which does not exist in the provided context.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several specific details provided in the Gold Answer: the timing of the father's heart attack ('last year'), the patient's starting age for smoking (18), her previous smoking rate (10/day), her living situation (living alone), and her history of teenage anxiety attacks.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence and contents of a 'Knowledge Graph' (e.g., specific semantic triples like [smoke --[RISK_FACTOR]--> chest pain]). These references are not grounded in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing all components of the prompt including the interactions between the factors and providing illustrative details from the text."
