  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer for the items it includes. It correctly identifies the duration of the cough, the nature of the sputum (greenish), and the impact on sleep.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer. Specifically, it omits: the initial 'dry' characteristic of the cough, the absence of a foul smell, the subjective fevers (feeling 'hot at night'), and the impact on exercise. Crucially, it misses almost the entire list of explicitly denied symptoms such as night sweats, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly traceable to the transcript. The citations are accurate and reflect the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's requirements for respiratory symptoms, sputum characteristics, and denials, though the depth of the response is lacking compared to the gold standard."
