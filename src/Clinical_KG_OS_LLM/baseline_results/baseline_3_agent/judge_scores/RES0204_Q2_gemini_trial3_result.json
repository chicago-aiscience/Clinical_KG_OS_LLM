  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) and provides the correct rationale for the swab. However, it incorrectly references a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the source transcript provided.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the primary diagnostic procedures and the specific rationale requested. It misses some of the descriptive context included in the Gold Answer, such as the doctor's explanation of an X-ray or the mention of the swab being uncomfortable.",
    "faithfulness": "The mention of a 'knowledge graph' is a hallucination as it is not present in the transcript. All other claims and quotes are accurately sourced from the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both components of the user's question without unnecessary filler."
