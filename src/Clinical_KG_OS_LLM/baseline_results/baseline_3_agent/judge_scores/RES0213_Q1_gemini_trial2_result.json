  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. Most significantly, it attributes the chest pain exclusively to anxiety attacks by misinterpreting P-20; in the transcript, P-20 refers to heart fluttering (palpitations), not the chest pain. The Generated Answer also fails to mention that the pain is triggered by taking a deep breath, a core characteristic mentioned in both the transcript and Gold Answer. While it correctly identifies the 20-minute duration, the overall description of when the pain occurs and resolves is incorrect compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The 'deep breath' trigger, 2) The 'odd/uncomfortable' quality, 3) The specific situational triggers of being 'alone' while walking or studying, and 4) The specific resolution situations (talking to people, working with hands, being at school).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the chest pain is 'exclusive to episodes of anxiety attacks.' It cites P-20 for this, but P-20 is the patient's response to a question about heart fluttering, not chest pain. The patient explicitly states the chest pain occurs while walking to school or studying, which contradicts the Generated Answer's claim of exclusivity to anxiety attacks.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing the prompt's requested categories (quality, duration, occurrence, resolution). However, the content within those categories is inaccurate."
