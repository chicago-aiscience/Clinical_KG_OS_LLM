  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the source transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the cough, sputum characteristics, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, feverishness, sinus pressure, and the most bothersome symptom (cough).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the majority of the key points but misses two specific symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: the reduced exercise tolerance (difficulty walking the dog/around the block) [P-4] and the mild headache [P-14]. It also omits the pertinent negatives (denial of sore throat, nausea, etc.) which the Gold Answer includes as part of the patient's report.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript with accurate citations to the correct turns (e.g., [P-1], [P-12]). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question (the list of symptoms and the most bothersome symptom) without unnecessary filler."
