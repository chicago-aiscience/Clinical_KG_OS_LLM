  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is generally accurate. It correctly identifies the two-week duration, the initial flu symptoms (3-4 days), the mucus characteristics (whitish-clear, 4-5 days), and the transition to a dry cough. However, it attributes the 'not go away' status to high frequency using [P-2], whereas the patient actually confirms frequency and intensity remained stable later in the transcript [P-7, P-8]. It also misses the specific mention of sore throat and runny nose, referring only to 'flu symptoms'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) Specific naming of sore throat and runny nose; 2) The fact that cough intensity remained the same; 3) The specific frequency of 3-4 times per hour; 4) The absence of fever; 5) The negative COVID test results. While it follows the general timeline, it lacks the clinical granularity of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is supported by the transcript. The use of 'remained high' for frequency is a slight interpretation of 'it just doesn't go' and '3 or 4 times an hour', but it is not a hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the prompt's request for a timeline, mucus description, and transition details. It stays focused on the symptom progression."
