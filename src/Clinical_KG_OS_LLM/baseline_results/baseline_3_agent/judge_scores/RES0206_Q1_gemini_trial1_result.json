  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the information provided in the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the cough, sputum, hemoptysis, and dyspnea as respiratory symptoms, and the fever and sinus pressure as systemic symptoms. It also correctly identifies the cough as the most bothersome symptom.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two specific positive symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: the reduced exercise tolerance (difficulty walking the dog/around the block) [P-4] and the mild headache [P-14]. It also does not include the 'pertinent negatives' mentioned in the Gold Answer, although the question primarily asked for symptoms the patient reported.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are directly supported by the provided transcript and include accurate speaker references (e.g., [P-1], [P-9], [P-12]).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific question asked, providing a clear breakdown of respiratory and systemic symptoms and the most bothersome one."
