  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, correctly states that a swab test was ordered, correctly reports the expected turnaround time as 24–48 hours, and correctly names the alternative diagnosis as another viral illness if COVID testing is negative. These align with the Gold Answer and the transcript [D-52]. No factual inaccuracies noted.",
    "completeness": "For the elements asked in the question (condition to rule out; specific diagnostic test and expected turnaround time; alternative diagnosis if negative), the Generated Answer includes all required components: COVID-19, swab, 24–48 hours, and another viral illness. It does not mention isolation/contact tracing/supportive care, but those are not required by the question prompt even though they appear in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript, specifically [D-52]. No added or fabricated details beyond what is stated.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question: it addresses exactly the condition, the test with turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis if negative, without tangential content."
