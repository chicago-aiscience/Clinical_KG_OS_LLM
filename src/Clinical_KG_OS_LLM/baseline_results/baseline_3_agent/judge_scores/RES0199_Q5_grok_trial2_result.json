  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts the Gold Answer and transcript by claiming the doctor 'did not systematically explore' living situation (contra D-45/D-46/P-45/P-46), workplace (contra D-48/D-50/P-48/P-50), travel (contra D-49/P-49), and sick contacts (contra D-47/P-47), instead misrepresenting contact tracing (D-52) as exploration; this is mostly incorrect with full contradictions on core facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: post-P-38 exploration of living (apartment alone, environmental triggers), sick contacts (possible at work lunchroom), workplace (car dealership, coworkers sick?), travel (recent denied), substance use screening, no clear source; Generated covers 0% of these, instead denying all explorations and adding irrelevant COVID focus.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absences of clear transcript questions (D-45-D-50 on living/work/travel/contacts); only verifiable claim is COVID mention (D-52), but misinterprets contact tracing as doctor exploration; largely fabricated denials contradict transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses the question by listing the exact exposure categories (living, workplace, travel, sick contacts) and claiming lack of exploration, with no off-topic content beyond brief COVID context."
