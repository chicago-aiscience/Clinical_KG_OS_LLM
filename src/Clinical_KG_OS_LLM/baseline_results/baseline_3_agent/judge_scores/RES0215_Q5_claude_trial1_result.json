  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all major risk factors mentioned in the Gold Answer: seasonal allergies with OTC antihistamine use, recurrent viral infections over two years, new carpets installed six months ago, and cold weather sensitivity. It accurately describes the exercise-induced nature of symptoms and resolution with rest. However, it introduces unsupported elements like 'acute exacerbation' and makes assertions about 'Knowledge Graph' relationships that are not present in the source transcript. The core medical relationships are accurate but the presentation differs from the Gold Answer's clinical reasoning.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36], recurrent viral infections [P-15, P-16], new carpets [P-54], cold weather worsening [P-38], exercise triggering [P-3, P-41], and resolution with rest [P-6]. It also mentions relevant environmental factors like smoking (denied), pets (denied), though it doesn't explicitly cite all the same passage numbers. The answer addresses atopic predisposition and airway hyperresponsiveness conceptually, though not using identical terminology. Coverage is approximately 85-90% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it repeatedly references a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not appear in the source material, creating multiple hallucinated elements (e.g., 'viral infection [CAUSES] wheezy', 'Reactine --[TAKEN_FOR]--> seasonal allergies', 'cold weather [WORSENS] wheezy', 'carpets [ASSOCIATED_WITH] wheezy'). These Knowledge Graph references appear to be fabricated linking structures. The clinical facts themselves are accurate to the transcript, but the presentation method introduces significant non-grounded content. This represents a moderate faithfulness issue.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about how the four factors (seasonal allergies, recurrent viral infections, new carpets, cold weather sensitivity) relate to exercise-induced wheezing. It systematically addresses each factor and explains their collective contribution to the current symptoms. The structure is logical with sections on clinical presentation, viral infections, seasonal allergies, environmental exacerbators, and a conclusion synthesizing the relationships. There is minimal off-topic content, though the Knowledge Graph references add unnecessary technical framing."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates strong correctness and relevance, accurately identifying all major risk factors and their relationship to exercise-induced wheezing. Completeness is good, covering 85-90% of Gold Answer key points with appropriate citations. However, faithfulness is compromised by repeated references to a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not exist in the source material, introducing fabricated linking structures despite the underlying clinical facts being accurate. The answer would benefit from removing these hallucinated Knowledge Graph references while maintaining its otherwise solid clinical reasoning."
