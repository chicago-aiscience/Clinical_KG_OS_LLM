  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two proposed diagnostic procedures: chest X-ray (doctor said the supervising physician “might want to do a chest X Ray…to get a better look” [D-37]) and COVID swab (proposed in [D-39]). It also correctly states the rationale for the COVID swab: they are doing it for “anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately” [D-39], consistent with the Gold Answer’s “institutional protocol/standard screening” rationale. \n\nHowever, it adds an unsupported statement: “This decision is noted in the knowledge graph…”—there is no “knowledge graph” in the transcript or Gold Answer. This is a minor factual/grounding issue but does not change the core clinical facts.",
    "completeness": "It covers the key required elements from the Gold Answer that the question asks for:\n- Diagnostic procedures proposed: chest X-ray and COVID nasal swab.\n- Specific rationale for COVID swab: routine testing for anyone with these symptoms lately.\n\nIt omits some ancillary Gold Answer details (e.g., X-ray described as a picture inside the body; swab being uncomfortable; plan to return with supervising doctor), but these are not required to answer the question as asked. Overall coverage of the requested key points is complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript with correct citations (chest X-ray [D-37], COVID swab and rationale [D-39]). The “knowledge graph” reference is not supported by the transcript and constitutes a minor hallucination/unverifiable addition. Otherwise, the answer remains grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the diagnostic procedures proposed and the rationale for the COVID swab, which directly answers the question. No significant irrelevant content beyond the brief ‘knowledge graph’ sentence."
