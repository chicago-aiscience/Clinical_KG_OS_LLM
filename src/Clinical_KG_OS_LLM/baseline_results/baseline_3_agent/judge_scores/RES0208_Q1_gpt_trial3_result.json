  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies weakness [P-2], generalized achiness [P-20], loss of taste [P-4], subjective fever/hotness [P-4], and decreased appetite/reduced intake [P-2, P-4]. However, it contains a major factual/citation error for upper-respiratory symptoms: it claims the patient explicitly stated “sore throat and cough” at [P-1], but [P-1] only mentions shortness of breath and being rundown/tired; cough is discussed at [P-7–P-8] and sore throat at [P-9]. This misattribution/incorrect quotation materially reduces correctness, though the overall symptom set is partially right.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: loss of taste, weakness, muscle aches/overall achy, subjective fever, decreased appetite. Key elements missed: diminished sense of smell [P-6]; characterization of cough as early/dry and minimal actual coughing [P-7–P-8]; mild/starting sore throat [P-9] (it’s listed but with wrong support); explicit denial of runny nose/congestion [P-10]; mild headaches with context that they are not more than usual/stress-related [P-11–P-13]. Overall this is roughly about half to two-thirds of the Gold Answer content.",
    "faithfulness": "Several points are grounded with accurate citations (weakness [P-2], taste change [P-4], feverishness [P-4], appetite [P-2, P-4], achiness [P-20]). But the statement/quote that the patient explicitly said “sore throat and cough” and the citation to [P-1] are not supported anywhere in the transcript, representing hallucinated content and incorrect citation. Also, some nuance present in the transcript (dry/incipient cough; denial of congestion; headache context) is omitted rather than fabricated. Overall, multiple issues but not pervasive fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on “other specific symptoms” beyond shortness of breath and fatigue and organizes them into the requested domains (sensory, URI, musculoskeletal, constitutional). No meaningful irrelevant content."
