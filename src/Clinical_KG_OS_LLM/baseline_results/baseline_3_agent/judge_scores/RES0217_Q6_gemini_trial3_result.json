  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the clinical plan detailed in the transcript and gold answer. It correctly identifies the diagnostic tests (tick ID, blood work, physical exam), the treatment (prophylactic antibiotics), the physician consultation, and the preventive advice (grass/woods intersection and insecticide).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers nearly all key points but misses a few specific details found in the gold answer: it does not mention the geographic risk of Strathroy specifically, and it omits the description of the tick's 'waving motion' in the preventive advice section. It also captures the consultation but doesn't explicitly note the trainee-supervisor dynamic implied by the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. All claims, including the mention of deer ticks, serology/titres, and the 72-hour window for antibiotics, are supported by the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured according to the prompt's request for a comprehensive clinical plan including diagnostic tests, treatments, consultations, and preventive advice."
