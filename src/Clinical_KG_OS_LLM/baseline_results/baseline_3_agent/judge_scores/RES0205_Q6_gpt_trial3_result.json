  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects [D-37]: the doctor will do a quick listen to the heart and lungs and a quick physical exam, then consult the doctor they’re working with, review what was discussed, and return to discuss next steps. It does not introduce any facts that contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core elements asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) specified exam components (heart/lung auscultation + quick physical exam) and (2) the process for next steps (consult supervising doctor, review discussion, return to patient). It omits additional contextual points included in the Gold Answer (foreshadowing at [D-1], patient agreement at [P-37], and that no diagnosis/medication was provided), which are supportive but not strictly required to answer the question as phrased.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by [D-37]. No hallucinated exam elements (e.g., vitals, throat exam) or invented management steps are added.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the doctor’s end-of-consultation plan, the specified physical exam components, and the described process for determining next steps."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, well-grounded, and highly relevant, but slightly less complete than the Gold Answer due to omission of supporting contextual details (e.g., [D-1]/[P-37] and the explicit note that no diagnosis/meds were given)."
