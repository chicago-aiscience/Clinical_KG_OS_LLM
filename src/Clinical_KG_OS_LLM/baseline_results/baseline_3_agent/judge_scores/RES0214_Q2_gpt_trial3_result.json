  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer: patient takes only multivitamins; drug allergy is penicillin; reaction is rash (no trouble breathing). Generated Answer correctly identifies multivitamins and penicillin, but incorrectly states the transcript does not specify the adverse reaction. This directly contradicts [P-38] (“I get a rash”). It also introduces an unsupported claim that a “Knowledge Graph” supports pre-diabetes management with multivitamins/glucose monitoring, which is not part of the provided source transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer: (1) Medication regimen limited to multivitamins only; (2) No prescription meds despite prediabetes; (3) Allergy to penicillin; (4) Reaction is rash; (5) No trouble breathing. Generated Answer includes (1) and (3) but misses (4) and (5), and does not clearly state lack of other meds (though implied). Overall covers about half to two-thirds of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not fully grounded in the transcript: it references a “Knowledge Graph” and adds claims about pre-diabetes management not supported by the transcript. Most importantly, it claims the adverse reaction is not specified, despite explicit transcript evidence of “rash.” These are multiple ungrounded/contradictory elements.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to answer exactly what was asked (medications, allergy, adverse reaction). Aside from the unnecessary “Knowledge Graph” mention, it stays on-topic."
