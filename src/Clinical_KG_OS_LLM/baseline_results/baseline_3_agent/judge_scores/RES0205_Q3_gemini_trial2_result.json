  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis (COVID-19) and the result (negative), which matches the Gold Answer and the transcript. It accurately attributes the evidence to the patient's symptoms and work environment.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points, including the diagnosis, the negative result, hospital employment, and the persistent cough. However, it omits several specific details found in the Gold Answer: the patient's specific role as a 'clerk', the mention of PPE usage, the exact timing of the test (two weeks ago), and the patient's behavior after the test (staying home).",
    "faithfulness": "All information in the generated answer is grounded in the transcript. The mention of chest soreness as a factor is faithful to P-15, and the coworker concern is faithful to P-35.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the three parts of the prompt: the diagnosis investigated, the evidence for it, and the results."
