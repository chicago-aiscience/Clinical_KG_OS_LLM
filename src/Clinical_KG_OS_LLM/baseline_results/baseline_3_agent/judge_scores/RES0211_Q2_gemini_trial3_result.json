  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Claritin, birth control, and allergy shots. However, it fails to provide the specific name of the birth control ('Deyo') mentioned in the transcript. More significantly, it incorrectly states that no dosing details or frequencies were mentioned, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions a 'three months' cycle for the birth control and 'once a week' for the allergy shots.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific brand name 'Deyo', the 3-month duration of the pill, the 'once a week' frequency of the allergy shots, and the exclusion of the EpiPen. It covers about 40-50% of the specific details requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucination by referencing a 'knowledge graph [KG]' which was not part of the provided source material. It also incorrectly claims information (dosing/frequency) is missing from the transcript when it is present, which is a form of negative hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing the categories of medications and past treatments asked for in the question, even though it misses the specific details requested within those categories."
