  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as a “cardiac ischemic” picture, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-36]. It also correctly cites the clinician’s rationale that symptoms were more “chest tightness” than classic exertional dyspnea and that there was no associated pain [D-36], supported by the patient’s description of tightness with breathing/walking [P-1] and denial of pain [P-5]. No explicit factual contradictions are present, though it omits other clinician-screened cardiac red-flag negatives (anxiety/sweating/impending doom) that were part of the Gold rationale.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) cardiac ischemia placed lower on differential; (2) chest complaint characterized as tightness rather than exertional shortness of breath pattern; (3) absence of pain.\nKey points missed: the doctor/patient also established absence of associated symptoms such as anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom [D-6/P-6], which the Gold Answer includes as important evidence for lowering ischemia. Also missing the explicit tightness-vs-pain contrast as a highlighted rationale (it is implied but not fully articulated with [P-5]). Overall, it captures some but not all of the Gold Answer’s evidence set.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript: cardiac ischemia lower on differential [D-36], not really out of breath with exercise [D-36], and no pain [D-36/P-5], with chest tightness described by patient [P-1]. No clear hallucinated details or unsupported symptom claims are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements (which condition was lowered and what symptom findings/absences supported that). However, it is less responsive than the Gold Answer because it does not include the full set of cited absent symptoms (anxiety/sweats/impending doom) that the question explicitly asks for (“absence of certain symptoms”)."
