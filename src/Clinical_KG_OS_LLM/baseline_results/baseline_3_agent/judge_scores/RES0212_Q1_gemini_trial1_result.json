  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the cough duration (3 months), its recent worsening, the greenish sputum description, the painful coughing, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. The denials listed (pain and blood) are also accurate based on the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly less complete than the gold answer. It misses several key points: subjective fevers ('hot at night'), the initial dry/intermittent nature of the cough, the absence of a foul smell in the sputum, and the impact on exercise. Crucially, it omits the majority of the explicit denials mentioned in the gold answer, including night sweats, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All claims are supported by specific dialogue turns (e.g., [P-19], [D-47]) and there are no hallucinations or fabricated symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is directly relevant to the question, focusing specifically on reported symptoms, sputum characteristics, and denials."
