  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the two categories of symptoms as requested by the prompt and defined in the gold answer. It correctly attributes 'fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches' to the general infectious process and 'difficulty breathing, sore throat, and cough' to the concern for COVID-19, all based on turn [D-36].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the primary symptoms listed in the gold answer. However, it omits a nuanced observation found in the gold answer: that while the patient reported loss of taste and smell in the history, the doctor explicitly excluded these from his summary in [D-36] when discussing the COVID-19 ruling.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is strictly grounded in the provided transcript, specifically referencing turns [D-1], [P-1], and [D-36]. It does not hallucinate any information and accurately quotes the doctor's specific phrasing (e.g., 'very cool sort of a sore throat').",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without unnecessary filler."
