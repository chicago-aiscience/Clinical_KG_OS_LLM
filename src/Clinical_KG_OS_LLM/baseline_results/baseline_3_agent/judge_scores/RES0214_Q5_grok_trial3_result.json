  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's prioritization of COVID-19 due to the husband's similar week-long illness (citing P-19 and D-53 correctly, matching Gold), the lack of flu shot making influenza viable (P-53, D-53/D-54), and shared household implying transmission. Core facts align with Gold Answer and transcript. However, it introduces non-existent 'knowledge graph' (KG) references (e.g., KG: fever/sore throat --RELATED_TO--> husband_current_illness), which are fabricated and create minor discrepancies from the Gold Answer's transcript-only basis.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Husband's week-long similar symptoms suggesting household transmission, doctor acknowledgment [P-19/20, D-51/53] - fully covered; (2) Limited outside contact (work from home [P-23/42], staying home [P-22], hiking [P-18], no other sick contacts [P-17]) supporting household over independent exposure - partially covered via 'shared household' but misses specific details like work/hiking/no contacts; (3) No flu shot [P-53/D-53] fitting both diagnoses, prioritizing COVID - fully covered. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript citations (P-19, D-53, P-53, D-54) are accurate and verifiable. Claims about doctor's linking to COVID, isolation, and differentials match transcript. However, multiple 'knowledge graph' (KG) references (two explicit KG: notations) are entirely fabricated/not in transcript, introducing hallucinated elements. Minor other phrases like 'clinical context provided' are vague but plausible.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring around the three specified epidemiological factors (husband's illness, shared environment, no flu shot) and explaining their collective role in prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza in the differential, with no off-topic content."
