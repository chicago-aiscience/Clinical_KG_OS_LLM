  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies (1) the patient is on a statin for cholesterol but cannot recall which one, and (2) the clinician proposes prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72 hours attachment, with no antibiotic specified. It also correctly includes discussion of tick lab identification, possible bloodwork/serology, a quick physical exam, and environmental insecticide. Minor issues: it cites [D-5] for prophylactic antibiotics though that segment is about tick type/coloration; the prophylaxis statement is in [D-6]. It also adds an extra justification (“medical knowledge graph”) not part of the visit.",
    "completeness": "Key items from the Gold Answer that are covered: current statin (unspecified), new prophylactic antibiotics (unspecified), tick sent to lab, possible blood work/serology, physical exam, and insecticide suggestion. Key items missed: the patient’s denial of allergies/no drug allergies, the past tick bite treatment with antibiotics (~10 years ago), and the plan to consult the supervising physician before finalizing treatment.",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is grounded in the transcript. However, the explicit reference to a “medical knowledge graph” and [KG] is not in the transcript (an unsupported addition). Otherwise, the described treatments/diagnostics match the transcript; citation to [D-5] for antibiotics is imprecise but the underlying claim is supported by [D-6].",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications and treatments discussed (statin therapy and proposed prophylaxis), and includes other relevant management steps from the consultation. No major tangents."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and on-topic, covering the main medication and prophylaxis plan, but it omits several discussed items (allergies, prior antibiotics, consult plan) and includes one unsupported [KG] reference."
