  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer has factual inaccuracies compared to Gold: incorrectly states diarrhea onset as 'few days back' without specifying 2 days [P-28]; claims no explicit frequency for diarrhea despite P-28 stating 'five or six times a day'; fails to identify cough as dry [P-12], mis-cites P-11 (stability, not nature); omits vomiting yesterday timing and food contents [P-32,34]; no headache severity 7/10 [P-8], instead vaguely infers from persistence and Tylenol; misses many specifics like liquid stools, no blood, resp/GI negatives. Core symptoms mentioned but significant errors/omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: resp (dry cough 4d stable no sputum/blood, negatives SOB/wheeze/chest pain); GI (diarrhea 2d liquid 5-6x/d no blood, nausea today vomit yesterday 2x food no blood, GI negatives); headache (4d persistent bilateral forehead/top 7/10 no rad/stiff unusual). Generated covers: cough onset/stable vaguely, diarrhea mention no details, vomit 2x nausea, headache onset/persistent no rating/location. Misses ~80% specifics/negatives asked (cough nature, diarrhea freq, vomit details, headache severity/location). Covers 20-49%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly grounded but errors: diarrhea freq wrongly 'not explicitly stated' (P-28 contradicts); cough 'nature' mis-cited P-11 (stability), dry cough P-12 omitted; headache severity inferred vaguely ('high' from 'really sick'/Tylenol) not 7/10; onsets from P-1 ok but imprecise for GI; no major fabrications but multiple misreads/unverifiable inferences and false claim on freq. Multiple issues.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses GI (diarrhea/nausea/vomiting), respiratory (cough), headache characteristics/severity as per question; structured directly, no off-topic content."
