{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with both the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the diagnostic test (COVID-19 swab), the results timeline (24-48 hours), the isolation period (14 days), the trigger for contact tracing (positive result), and the specific supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep/rest, antipyretics/Tylenol, and NSAIDs/anseads).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 100% of the key management points. It addresses all specific items requested in the prompt (test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care). While it omits the doctor's mention of an 'alternative diagnosis' (another viral illness) found in the Gold Answer, it covers every aspect of the actual management plan requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It even retains the transcript's phonetic spelling of 'anseads' (NSAIDs), ensuring no hallucination of outside medical terminology beyond what was stated or implied in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, structured clearly with headers that correspond directly to the components of the question. It avoids any irrelevant tangents."
