  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the sequence of events. It claims the doctor prioritized the lung/heart exam [D-1] 'because of this family history.' However, the transcript shows the doctor planned the exam in [D-1] at the start of the encounter, long before the family history was disclosed in [D-28]. The Generated Answer correctly identifies that asthma was ruled out based on the absence of shortness of breath and wheezing.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention the current symptoms of a clear runny nose as part of the differentiating profile; 2) It misses the patient's comparison to previous illnesses (which were shorter and didn't involve this type of cough, per [P-24]); 3) It doesn't explicitly mention that the cough itself was dry/non-productive as a point of comparison.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinations a causal link, stating the doctor's initial plan was triggered by the family history. In the transcript, the doctor's inquiry about family history [D-28] happens after the symptoms are discussed and the physical exam is already planned. The rest of the symptoms mentioned are grounded in [P-28].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question, although it misinterprets the causal direction of the doctor's inquiry and the exam prioritization."
