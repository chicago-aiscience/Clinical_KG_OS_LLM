  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition [D-45], the hypothetical scenario for inclusion (cough or shortness of breath without fever) [D-45], and the excluding finding (presence of fever, specified as over 100°F from [P-1]) matching the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor differences include less precise temperature details (Gold cites 101/100.1°F from [P-1,P-2]) and omission of supporting details like no wheezing [P-7] or uncertain SOB [P-8], but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: condition (asthma), hypothetical presentation (cough/SOB without fever), excluding finding (fever with temp details), conclusion (sounds like infection) [D-45]. Missed: exact temp values (101/100.1°F), full citations ([P-2]), no wheezing [P-7], uncertain SOB [P-8], note that asthma not permanently ruled out, prioritization of infection workup. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: asthma and hypothetical [D-45], fever over 100 [P-1], infection conclusion [D-45]. Citations accurate. Minor ungrounded phrase 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript) but does not affect claims; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers the question by naming the condition (asthma) and specific excluding finding (fever), with precise transcript references; no off-topic content."
