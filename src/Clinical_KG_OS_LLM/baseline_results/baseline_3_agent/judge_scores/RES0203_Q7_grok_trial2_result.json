  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the simultaneous onset of all three symptoms two days prior, citing P-1 correctly; states no worsening or fluctuation, supported by P-8 for cough and implicitly for others via 'no evidence'; correctly notes no prior history. All facts align with Gold Answer without errors or contradictions, though less detailed on sensory consistency and partial losses.",
    "completeness": "Covered: simultaneous onset of all symptoms (P-1); no worsening/fluctuation (P-1, P-8); no prior history. Missed or partially covered: explicit confirmation cough started same time (D-6, P-6); sensory symptoms 'pretty consistent' (D-5, P-5); partial nature persisted throughout (P-4); doctor's observation (D-39); no intermittent/variable explicit. Covers core ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: onset in P-1 (lists all together); cough mild/consistent in P-1/P-8; no fluctuation verifiable as patient denies worsening/changes; prior history 'no mention of experiencing' accurate as P-3 denies it explicitly (no hallucination, phrasing precise). Citations match transcript exactly. No fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question: onset timing/relative (simultaneous); worsening/fluctuation (none); prior symptoms (none). Bullet structure mirrors question elements; no off-topic content."
