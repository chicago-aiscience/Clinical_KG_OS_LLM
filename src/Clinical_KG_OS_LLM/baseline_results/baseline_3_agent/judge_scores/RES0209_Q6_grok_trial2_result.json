  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies three core elements: COVID swab (D-29), explicit suggestion of medication change (D-43 quote), and consultation (D-29, D-43). Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID swab and consultation (citing D-29). However, it incorrectly states 'the transcript does not explicitly state a directive to change the medication,' directly contradicting the explicit suggestion in D-43 ('maybe all you need is a little change to your medications'). It infers a review instead, introducing a factual error on the nature of the suggestion. Minor issues include partial citation of consultation and unquoted goals like sports. Overall, significant contradiction on medication change.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) COVID swab despite negative screens (100% covered); 2) Medication change suggestion, noting rescue-only regimen and increased use (partially covered as implied review, misses explicit quote, context on regimen, sports goal); 3) Consultation as trainee presenting case, returning shortly (partially covered, misses trainee detail and D-43). Covers test fully, consultation ~70%, medication ~30%. Approximately 60-70% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "COVID swab verifiable [D-29]. Consultation verifiable [D-29, implied D-43]. Medication review plausible from symptoms [P-1, P-8, P-15] and consultation, but claim 'does not explicitly state a directive' is false as D-43 has suggestion; 'asthma exacerbation [D-29]' not in transcript (hallucinated label, D-29 is about COVID/questions). Citations mostly accurate, but one misattribution and denial of explicit content. Some unverifiable/plausible claims amid minor hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the question's elements (test, consultation, medication), using numbered list matching plan components. Minor tangent on symptoms as evidence, but stays focused on clinician's plan without off-topic content."
