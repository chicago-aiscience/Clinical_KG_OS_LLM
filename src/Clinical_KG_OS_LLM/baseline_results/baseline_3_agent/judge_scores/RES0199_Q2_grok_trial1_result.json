  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the home medication for headache with accurate citations [P-3, P-4], matching Gold. Doctor's recommendations (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches, isolation, COVID test) align closely, with 'anseads' being a minor transcription match to NSAIDs. No major errors, but minor discrepancy in not noting patient's prior hydration efforts explicitly as in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers: Tylenol for headache (100%); doctor's supportive measures (hydration, food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches - 100%); isolation and test (100%). Misses explicit mention of patient's self-initiated hydration [P-30] as a prior home measure noted in Gold (~90-95% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims [P-3, P-4, D-52] verifiable in transcript. 'Anseads (analgesics)' matches transcript 'anseads' plausibly as NSAIDs. Hallucination: 'knowledge graph' and [TREATMENT] links not in transcript, but minor addition.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around patient's home medication/symptom and doctor's additional plan, perfectly matching question with no off-topic content."
