  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: the doctor’s questions about fever/runny nose/sick contacts/travel/rash/phlegm/pain were intended to screen out infectious (URTI/viral illness, bronchitis, pneumonia), exposure-related infections, systemic viral/allergic illnesses with rash, and productive lower-respiratory infection; patient denied fever, coryza, sick contacts, travel, rash, phlegm, and pain, and appeared otherwise well.\n\nGenerated answer instead frames the differential mainly as “viral infection vs seasonal allergies,” does not correctly connect each of the asked screening questions to the corresponding excluded conditions, and incorrectly states that key screening questions (fever/runny nose/sick contacts) were not present in the transcript. It also introduces “Knowledge Graph” support not in the transcript. While viral illness/allergic components are not impossible clinically, the response does not accurately answer what the doctor was screening for with those specific questions, and contains explicit factual error about the transcript content.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold:\n- Fever question → screen pneumonia/bronchitis/infection; patient: no fever. (MISSED)\n- Runny nose → screen URTI/viral-induced wheeze; patient: no runny nose. (MISSED)\n- Sick contacts → screen contagious infection; patient: none. (MISSED)\n- Recent travel → screen exposure-related infection; patient: no travel due to COVID. (MISSED)\n- Rash → screen systemic viral illness or allergic reaction; patient: none. (MISSED)\n- Phlegm → distinguish productive infectious process vs reactive/nonproductive; patient: no phlegm. (MISSED)\n- Pain → screen pleuritic/musculoskeletal; patient: no pain. (MISSED)\n- Otherwise well + no antibiotics previously → supports non-bacterial, narrows toward reactive airway disease. (PARTIALLY/INDIRECTLY)\n\nOverall, it omits nearly all required elements and does not report the relevant denials tied to the asked screening questions.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple issues:\n- Claims “specific questions about fever, runny nose, and sick contacts … were not present,” which directly contradicts the transcript (they are present at D-7/D-8/D-10).\n- Mentions a “Knowledge Graph confirms/links…” which is not in the transcript.\n- Interprets the episode as viral based on prior viral infections; transcript only says prior infections over two years were viral, not that current episode is viral.\n\nSome cited transcript elements (seasonal allergies, Reactine, cold weather worsening) are present, but major statements are ungrounded or contradicted.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically what diagnoses the clinician was screening/excluding via fever/runny nose/sick contacts/travel/rash/phlegm questions and what the patient answered. The generated answer does not directly map those questions to screened conditions, and largely shifts to a viral vs allergy discussion. It includes some respiratory differential content but fails to address the requested screening logic and the corresponding patient responses."
