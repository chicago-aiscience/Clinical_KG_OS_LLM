  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states the pain occurs 'only if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack' when the transcript clearly shows the pain occurs while walking to school and studying alone [P-4, P-29]. The answer misses critical information about the pain being worse with deep breaths [P-3] and fails to capture that the pain resolves when engaged with others [P-9, P-29]. The characterization is fundamentally wrong.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only about 30% of key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the sharp quality and 20-minute duration but completely misses: the initial 'uncomfortable/odd' description, pain with deep breaths, occurrence at rest, pain during walking and studying alone, resolution when engaged with others/talking to people/hands-on tasks, no worsening with exercise, no prior occurrence, and no preceding injury. Major gaps in coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains hallucinations and misrepresentations. The claim that pain occurs 'only if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack' contradicts P-20 where the patient says heart flutter happens 'only if' having anxiety attacks, not the chest pain. The answer fabricates a direct causal link between anxiety attacks and chest pain episodes that isn't supported by the transcript. The patient discusses anxiety as a concern but doesn't state pain only occurs during attacks.",
    "relevance": "The answer partially addresses the question about characteristics, quality, duration, and situations. However, it heavily emphasizes anxiety/stress as triggers when the transcript shows the pain actually occurs during solitary activities (walking, studying alone) and resolves with social engagement. The focus on anxiety attacks as the exclusive context is misleading and misses the actual situational patterns described."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates poor quality across all dimensions. It contains significant factual errors, particularly in mischaracterizing the pain as occurring only during anxiety attacks when the transcript clearly indicates it happens during solitary activities like walking and studying. The answer misses approximately 70% of key clinical details including pain with deep breaths, occurrence at rest, and resolution when socially engaged. It also contains hallucinated claims that contradict the source material. While it correctly identifies some basic features (sharp quality, 20-minute duration), the fundamental misunderstanding of when the pain occurs versus resolves makes this a clinically inaccurate response."
