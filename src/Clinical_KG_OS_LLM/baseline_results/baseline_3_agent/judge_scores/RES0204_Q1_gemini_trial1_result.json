  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states that the transcript does not specify whether the cough is productive or non-productive. However, the transcript explicitly confirms the cough is dry (D-5, P-5, P-24) and non-productive (D-6, P-6). This directly contradicts both the Gold Answer and the source text.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the two main symptoms (cough and runny nose) and the appearance of the nasal discharge. However, it misses the specific nature of the cough (which it claims is unknown) and omits several pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of sore throat and chest pain.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript regarding the nature of the cough. By claiming the information is missing, it ignores multiple clear statements in the dialogue (D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6) where the patient and doctor agree the cough is dry and lacks 'gunk'.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly attempting to answer the specific components of the question (symptoms, duration, appearance, and nature)."
