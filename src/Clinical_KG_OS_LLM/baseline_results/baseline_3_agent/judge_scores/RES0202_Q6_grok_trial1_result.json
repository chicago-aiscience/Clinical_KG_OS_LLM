  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key elements of the management plan as described in the Gold Answer and transcript, including the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation (including sister), false negative possibility, alternative diagnosis of another viral illness/infection, and specific warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). However, it omits the explicit assessment of symptoms as consistent with a COVID-like viral infection and the conditional differential consideration of asthma if no fever was present (from [D-45]), representing minor discrepancies while keeping core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab and 24-48 hrs (100%), isolation for 14 days including sister (100%), false negatives (100%), alternative diagnosis if negative (another viral illness, infection) (100%), warning signs with examples (100%). Missed: explicit assessment phrasing ('consistent with viral infectious process aligned with COVID-19', 'sounds like an infection'), asthma differential note if no fever, and no medications/watchful waiting. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: COVID swab/24-48hrs [D-44], isolation 14 days incl. sister [D-44], false negatives [D-44], another viral illness [D-44], infection [D-44/D-45], warning signs exactly match phrasing/examples from [D-44] (high temp, neuro sx like seizures, weak/dizzy, fainting). No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured to directly address the question by breaking down the assessment and management plan into the exact components requested (test/turnaround, isolation, alt diagnosis/false neg, warning signs), with no off-topic content or tangents."
