  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the sleep disruption timeline. It states that the cough started waking the patient up 'at night' in the 'last three days,' citing the doctor's summary [D-47]. However, the patient explicitly clarified earlier in the transcript [P-19, P-21] that the cough has been waking her up 'every night' for the 'last month.' The Gold Answer correctly identifies this one-month duration, whereas the Generated Answer misinterprets the doctor's summary as the onset of nocturnal awakenings.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the four main points requested (initial onset, sleep disruption, productive sputum, and fevers). However, it misses the specific context of the initial onset (the pole dancing class) which is included in the Gold Answer. It also lacks the concluding synthesis provided in the Gold Answer regarding the acute-on-chronic pattern.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misinterprets the transcript by prioritizing the doctor's closing summary [D-47] over the patient's direct testimony [P-21]. By claiming sleep disruption only became a nightly issue in the last three days, it contradicts the patient's statement that she has been woken up every night for the last month. The 'mild wakefulness' vs. 'waking up' distinction is not grounded in the patient's description.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, focusing strictly on the timeline requested by the prompt without extraneous information."
