  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the duration of the illness, the transition from a productive to a dry cough, and the chest soreness associated with coughing.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete compared to the gold answer. It misses two major resolved symptoms reported by the patient: a sore throat and a runny nose. It also fails to include specific details about the cough's frequency (3-4 times per hour), the lack of triggers (spontaneous), and the pertinent negatives (denial of fever, difficulty breathing, etc.) which were included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript. The descriptions of the mucus, the timeline for the dry cough transition, and the context of the chest pain are all verifiable in the patient's dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question asked, categorizing symptoms into resolved and present as requested."
