  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor as the prescribed medication for cholesterol, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-25, P-26]. It accurately notes Tylenol as OTC, with reported effectiveness 'helps a little bit' [P-14], consistent with Gold. However, minor discrepancies include not specifying 'high cholesterol' precisely, not confirming it's the only medication [P-27], and attributing Tylenol uses (fever, sore throat, chest pain) via a non-existent 'knowledge graph' rather than patient-reported symptom relief for feverish feeling.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: Lipitor for cholesterol [P-25,26]; Tylenol OTC with partial effectiveness [P-14]. Misses: explicit 'only' prescribed med [P-27]; Gold's note on no other meds; Tylenol specifically for 'feverish/unwell'; non-med relief [P-13]; extras like no allergies [P-29]. Covers ~80-90% of core medication details from Gold.",
    "faithfulness": "Lipitor mention and cholesterol use verifiable [P-25-27]. Tylenol mention and effectiveness verifiable [P-14]. However, 'knowledge graph' and specific Tylenol indications (fever/sore throat/chest pain) are not in transcript—patient did not specify uses, only took it for general relief; symptoms exist separately. [MEDICAL_HISTORY] tag hallucinated. Some plausible but unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around prescribed/OTC meds, conditions, and OTC effectiveness, perfectly matching question with no off-topic content."
