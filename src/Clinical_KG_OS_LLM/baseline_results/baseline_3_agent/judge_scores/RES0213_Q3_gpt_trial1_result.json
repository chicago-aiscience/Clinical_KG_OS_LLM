  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s main diagnosis (“Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain” / stress-related functional chest pain) aligns with the Gold Answer’s conclusion of anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain. It accurately cites major supporting factors: significant academic stress (Masters thesis), prior anxiety attacks, patient’s own suspicion of stress as a cause, and anxiety-associated breathing changes during episodes. A minor issue is terminology: “functional chest pain” is broader and not explicitly stated in the Gold Answer (though not incompatible). Also, it slightly overstates “shortness of breath” (the patient mainly reports breathing faster due to nervousness and difficulty taking a deep breath because of anxiety, while denying baseline breathing difficulty).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer supports include: (1) situational pattern—symptoms mainly when alone with thoughts and improving with distraction/people; (2) prior anxiety attacks and concern they may return; (3) major academic stress/time pressure; (4) anxiety physiology during episodes (breathing faster, hard to deep breathe due to nervousness); (5) patient attribution to stress; (6) pertinent negatives favoring non-cardiopulmonary causes (no fever, not exertional, occurs at rest, no palpitations except with anxiety, no asthma).\n\nThe Generated Answer covers (2), (3), (4), and (5), but misses the most question-central point (1) about occurring when alone and resolving with distraction, and omits the pertinent negatives (6). Overall coverage is partial (~60–70%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations (academic stress, anxiety history, duration/character, anxiety-related breathing changes, patient considering stress). The only mild ungrounded/overstated element is framing P-19 as “shortness of breath” rather than anxiety-driven faster breathing and difficulty with deep inspiration; however, it remains broadly consistent with the patient’s description. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response addresses the diagnostic question and provides several supporting consultation observations, but it fails to cite and explain the key situational/distraction pattern highlighted in the prompt and Gold Answer (pain when alone, improvement when distracted/with others). Because that pattern is central to the question, the answer is only partially responsive."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer identifies the correct overall diagnosis (anxiety/stress-related chest pain) and supports it with several transcript-based observations, but it omits the key “alone vs distracted” symptom pattern and pertinent negatives, making it only partially complete and partially aligned with the question focus."
