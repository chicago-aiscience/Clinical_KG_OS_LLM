  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the main management: COVID swab with turnaround 24–48 hours, isolation for 14 days, and isolating from the younger sister, consistent with [D-44]. It also accurately includes the ER return precautions (high fever, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, fainting) from [D-44].\nMinor inaccuracy: it claims that if the swab is negative and symptoms persist, asthma would be considered. In the transcript, asthma is mentioned conditionally (if it were just cough/shortness of breath without fever) rather than as the next step after a negative COVID test [D-45].",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: COVID swab test + 24–48h results; isolate 14 days; isolate from younger sister; ER precautions.\nKey points from the Gold Answer that are missing: the doctor’s explicit note about possible false negatives; mention that a negative test could still mean another viral illness circulating; the explicitly supportive/observational approach (no medications; “wait for swab results”); and the school requirement for a COVID test to return.\nOverall, it captures the core isolation/testing elements asked in the question but omits several additional management/context points present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript and correctly attributed to [D-44]. The asthma-related statement is a mild extrapolation/misframing of [D-45] (asthma was discussed as a differential in a different clinical scenario rather than specifically tied to a negative swab with persistent symptoms). Otherwise no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question’s requested items (diagnostic test, isolation instructions and duration, and who to isolate from). The added ER precautions are still relevant to “management measures.”"
