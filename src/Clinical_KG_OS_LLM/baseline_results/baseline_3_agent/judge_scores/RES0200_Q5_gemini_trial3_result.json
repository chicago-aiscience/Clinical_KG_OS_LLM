  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains two major factual errors. First, it states the COPD diagnosis was approximately two years ago, ignoring the patient's specific correction in [P-2] that it was 'probably five years ago.' Second, and more importantly, it claims the transcript does not specify daily smoking consumption, whereas [P-44] explicitly states the patient smokes half a pack a day and previously smoked 1-2 packs.",
    "completeness": "The prompt specifically requested the 'current consumption level' and 'how it has changed over time.' The Generated Answer failed to provide either of these data points, erroneously claiming they were not in the transcript. It missed approximately 50% of the key points requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails faithfulness by claiming that specific information (smoking consumption levels) is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present in [P-44]. It also prioritizes an earlier, less accurate statement about the diagnosis date [P-1] over the patient's later clarification [P-2].",
    "relevance": "While the answer is structured to address the question and correctly identifies the family history and the current exacerbation status, it fails to provide the specific details requested by the user regarding smoking levels, which was a core part of the question."
