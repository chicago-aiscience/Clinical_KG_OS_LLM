  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states patient takes no prescribed medications currently [P-23], stopped anxiety meds 2-3 years ago [P-24], manages acid reflux with diet only [P-25], no hay fever treatment mentioned, requesting cough meds but none prescribed yet [P-35, D-37], zero meds overall. Generated correctly notes no anxiety or reflux meds and diet for reflux, but errs by inferring dietary management applies to anxiety (P-25 is reflux-specific), treats COVID-19 as a condition despite negative test (not a diagnosed condition), misses hay fever, and notes cough request without clarifying no prescription given. Some factual errors but core no-meds point holds.",
    "completeness": "Gold covers: no current meds overall, anxiety history, reflux diet only, hay fever no treatment, cough request but none prescribed. Generated covers anxiety no med, reflux diet no med, cough request; misses hay fever entirely and explicit 'zero meds' summary; partially covers cough (request but not prescription status); adds irrelevant COVID. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: anxiety/reflux/cough cites accurate. Hallucinates anxiety managed by diet (misattributes P-25 reflux statement), fabricates COVID-19 as 'condition' with treatment (negative test and PPE not treatment for condition), cough details verifiable but over-detailed. Multiple hallucinated/misattributed facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses meds/treatment for conditions including reflux; structured response fits question. Minor tangents: excessive cough symptom details, irrelevant COVID section, inferred anxiety treatment."
