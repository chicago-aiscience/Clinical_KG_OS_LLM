  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer. Both identify the same diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), the same physical examination plan (examining the chest), identical self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate as much as possible), the same timeline (24-48 hours), and the same disposition criteria (based on test results). The Generated Answer correctly identifies the public health nurse will provide instructions if positive, matching the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) physical examination of chest, (2) diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), (3) self-isolation instructions with specific details about staying away from wife, (4) 24-48 hour timeline for results, (5) public health nurse follow-up if positive, and (6) disposition criteria based on test results. All major elements are addressed comprehensively.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The citations [D-36], [D-37], and [D-38] are accurate and appropriate. The physical exam reference correctly cites D-36 and D-37, diagnostic tests are from D-37, self-isolation instructions are from D-37, timeline is from D-37, and disposition criteria are from D-37. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: diagnostic tests ordered, physical examination planned, self-isolation instructions (including from whom - public health nurse), expected timeline for results, and criteria for hospital admission versus discharge. The response is well-focused with no irrelevant content and uses a clear structured format that maps to each question component."
