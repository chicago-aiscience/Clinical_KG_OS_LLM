  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly categorizes several symptoms (sore throat, swallowing difficulties, muscle ache) as 'screened for and denied' or 'negative findings', when in fact the patient confirmed having them. It correctly identifies the denial of smell loss. It relies on an external 'Knowledge Graph' not present in the provided source text, leading to a hallucinated structure of information.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. It misses several key negative findings explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript, including: cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, and chills/night sweats. It also misses the negative history regarding sick contacts and travel.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not part of the source transcript. While it correctly cites [P-19] for smell loss, it describes the patient as 'implying' breathing issues when the patient explicitly confirmed them [P-7].",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question but focuses almost exclusively on one symptom (loss of smell) while ignoring the bulk of the doctor's screening questions found in the D-15 to D-24 range of the transcript."
