  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The core logic matches the Gold Answer: persistent dry cough/runny nose led to consideration of chest X-ray to look for an underlying chest process, and COVID swab was ordered due to stated protocol for anyone with these symptoms. Minor issues: it cites [P-2] for “not improving,” whereas the transcript supports “stayed the same” at [P-7]. It also adds generic assertions (e.g., what a chest X-ray ‘targets’) not needed for the clinical rationale, but they don’t directly contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers some key positives (dry cough, clear rhinorrhea, duration/persistence) and the key COVID-testing rationale (institutional protocol). It misses many pertinent negatives emphasized in the Gold Answer (no sore throat, normal taste/smell, no chest pain, no myalgias, no headache/GI symptoms, no travel/sick contacts) and misses other factors cited in the Gold Answer for imaging (novelty of cough for patient, family history of asthma, and the framing that imaging was pursued despite absent high-acuity markers). Overall it captures roughly half of the Gold Answer’s reasoning elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations for the main points (symptoms, X-ray quote, COVID protocol quote). However, the “knowledge graph” statements (e.g., X-ray located at chest/lungs; COVID swab located at nose) are not from the transcript and are effectively extraneous additions. That constitutes some unverifiable content, though not extensive fabrication of clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers why the clinician ordered both a chest X-ray and a COVID swab based on the symptom pattern and protocol, with minimal tangential content."

  "summary": "The answer is largely accurate and on-topic, correctly identifying imaging for further evaluation and COVID testing due to protocol, but it omits many key present/absent findings and adds some non-transcript “knowledge graph” details."
