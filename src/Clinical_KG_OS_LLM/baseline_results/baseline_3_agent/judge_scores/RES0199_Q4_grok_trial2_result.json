  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the condition as COVID (matching transcript's 'covid' and Gold's 'COVID-19'), the swab test with 24-48 hour turnaround, and the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative, with no factual errors or contradictions to the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: rule out COVID-19 (covered), swab test with 24-48h turnaround (covered), alternative of another viral illness if negative (covered). Misses minor details like isolation for 14 days, public health contact tracing if positive, and supportive management, but covers 100% of the question-specific key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript (e.g., 'rule out covid', 'take a swab... 24 to 48 hours', 'if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness'); citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured to address the exact question components (condition, test+time, alternative diagnosis) with no off-topic content or tangents."
