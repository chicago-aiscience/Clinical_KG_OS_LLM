  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the contents of the provided transcript. It claims there are no doctor turns and that the transcript ends at [P-26], whereas the transcript clearly includes doctor turns up to [D-38]. Consequently, it fails to identify any of the next steps mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the mention of the doctor consulting with another physician, the plan to return shortly, the possibility of future tests, and the collaborative nature of the decision-making process.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the provided source. It hallucinates that the transcript is missing segments and contains only patient turns, which is directly contradicted by the text provided in the prompt.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer does not address the question. Instead of identifying the next steps, it provides a meta-commentary about the perceived (and incorrect) limitation of the text and then offers clinical inferences that were not part of the doctor's communication in the transcript."
