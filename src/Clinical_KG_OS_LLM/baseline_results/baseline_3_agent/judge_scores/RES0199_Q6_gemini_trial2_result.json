  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab, the 24-48 hour window for results, the 14-day isolation period, the condition for contact tracing (positive result), and all supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics, and NSAIDs/anseads).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all four specific requirements listed in the prompt: the diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care. While it omits the doctor's mention of a possible alternative diagnosis (other viral illness) and the observation that no prescriptions were ordered (which are present in the Gold Answer), it captures the entirety of the actionable management plan requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript [D-52]. It even preserves the phonetic spelling 'anseads' from the transcript (which refers to NSAIDs), showing strict adherence to the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, structured to directly address each component of the user's multi-part question without adding unnecessary information."
