  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer is only partially correct. It correctly notes seasonal allergies (Reactine use) and cold weather as a trigger from the transcript, but it incorrectly claims that questions about fever/runny nose/sick contacts were not present (they clearly are: D-7/D-8/D-10) and it overemphasizes “viral infection” as the likely current cause despite the patient denying fever, runny nose, sick contacts, and phlegm—responses that in the Gold Answer narrow away from acute infectious etiologies. It also omits/does not correctly identify the intended screening targets in the Gold Answer (pneumonia/bronchitis, URI, exposure-related infections, systemic/viral exanthems/allergic reactions, productive lower respiratory infection) and introduces unsupported framing (“Knowledge Graph”).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: mentions viral illness/allergy in broad terms and uses seasonal allergies/Reactine/cold trigger.\nKey points missed: (1) fever denial used to screen out pneumonia/bronchitis; (2) runny nose denial used to screen out URI/viral-induced wheeze; (3) sick contacts denial for contagious infection; (4) recent travel denial for exposure-related infections; (5) rash denial for systemic/viral illness or allergic reaction with cutaneous findings; (6) phlegm denial to distinguish productive infectious process; (7) pain denial for pleuritic/musculoskeletal causes; (8) “looks fine otherwise” and no antibiotics as supportive context; (9) explicit conclusion that negatives narrow toward reactive airway disease. Overall coverage is well under ~50% of Gold Answer elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “Knowledge Graph” are fabricated, and the statement that fever/runny nose/sick contact questions were not present contradicts the transcript. Some cited facts are grounded (seasonal allergies, Reactine, worse in cold), but the answer contains clear transcript-inconsistent claims and speculation about current viral etiology not supported by the negative infectious review of systems.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (attempts to discuss differential diagnosis for wheeze/cough), but it does not directly answer the asked mapping of each screening question (fever, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, rash, phlegm) to the condition being excluded and the patient’s specific responses. It therefore only partially addresses the question."
