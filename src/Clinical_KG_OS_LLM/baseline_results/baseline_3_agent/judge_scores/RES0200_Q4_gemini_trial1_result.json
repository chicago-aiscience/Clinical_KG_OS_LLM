  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer and transcript perfectly. It correctly identifies COVID as the diagnosis, the COVID swab as the test, and the 24-48 hour turnaround time.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all three components of the question (alternative diagnosis, diagnostic test, and turnaround time). It is slightly less detailed than the gold answer because it does not list the specific overlapping symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, chills) mentioned in the patient's history, but it covers 100% of the core required points.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript, specifically citing [D-52] for all points. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to directly address each part of the multi-part question without unnecessary information."
