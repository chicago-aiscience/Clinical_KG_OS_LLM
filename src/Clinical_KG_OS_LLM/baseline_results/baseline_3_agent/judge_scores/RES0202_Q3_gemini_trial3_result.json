  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the triad of symptoms (dry cough, fever, loss of taste) and the doctor's specific reasoning that the presence of fever differentiated the case from non-infectious conditions like asthma, pointing instead to an infectious process like COVID-19.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key points found in the Gold Answer. It mentions the timeline of the cough, the specific temperature readings, the mother's observation regarding the sense of taste, the doctor's alignment with COVID-19 symptoms, and the use of fever to rule out chronic conditions like asthma in favor of an infection.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It uses direct quotes and correct speaker tags (e.g., [P-1], [P-2], [D-44], [D-45]) to support its claims. It accurately reflects the transcript's phrasing 'allowed with symptoms of covid' which is verbatim from [D-44].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question: the specific combination of symptoms and how the doctor used them collectively to reach a diagnostic conclusion."
