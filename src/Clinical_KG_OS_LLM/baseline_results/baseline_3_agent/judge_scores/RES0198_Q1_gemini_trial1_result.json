  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors regarding the content of the transcript. It incorrectly claims that the character of the nasal discharge is not specified, whereas turn [P-5] explicitly states it is 'mostly clear'. It also incorrectly claims that the context for denied symptoms is missing, even though the provided transcript includes the doctor's specific questions for cough [D-4], post-nasal drip [D-6], sore throat [D-7], and loss of taste/smell [D-16].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover two out of the three main components of the question. While it correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy/runny nose), it misses the character of the discharge and the list of denied symptoms by claiming they are not present in the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a form of negative hallucination by asserting that information is absent from the source when it is clearly present. It fails to ground its claims in the provided transcript [P-5, D-4, D-6, D-7, D-16].",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address the question's categories but ultimately fails to provide the relevant information for the majority of the prompt, instead offering excuses about missing context that was actually provided."
