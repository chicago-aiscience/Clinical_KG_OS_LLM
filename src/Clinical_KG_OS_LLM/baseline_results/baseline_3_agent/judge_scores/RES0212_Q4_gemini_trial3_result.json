  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the doctor was screening for Tuberculosis (TB) and chronic infections. However, it fails to list the specific constitutional symptoms actually screened (night sweats and weight loss) and instead vaguely mentions 'general illness' and 'sleep disturbance'. It also misses the majority of specific exposure risks discussed (travel history, sick contacts, and IV drug use), focusing instead on cat exposure and smoking, which are less central to the 'serious conditions' aspect of the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete. It misses several key points from the Gold Answer: night sweats, unexplained weight loss, sick contacts (roommate, class), travel history, and IV drug use. It also omits the screening for a stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting. It covers less than 50% of the screening items detailed in the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is faithful to the transcript for the parts it includes. It correctly references the patient's statements about smoking [P-36], cat exposure [P-27], and the doctor's summary in [D-47]. No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant as it directly attempts to answer both parts of the prompt (symptoms/risks and conditions to exclude). However, its focus is slightly off-target by prioritizing allergies and smoking over the specific 'exposure risks' like travel and sick contacts that are standard for TB screening mentioned in the Gold Answer."
