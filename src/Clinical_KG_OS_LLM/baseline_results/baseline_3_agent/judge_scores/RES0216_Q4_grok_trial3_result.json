  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as 'cardiac ischemic' matching the Gold's 'cardiac ischemic picture' [D-36]. For nature of complaints, it accurately notes chest tightness over exertional dyspnea citing [D-36] and patient description [P-1], aligning with Gold's emphasis though Gold adds nuance on partial SOB [P-7]. For absences, it covers no pain [D-36, P-5] but omits anxiety/sweating/impending doom [D-6, P-6], a minor discrepancy as core deprioritization facts (tightness, no pain, no exertional SOB) are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: condition [D-36], nature as tightness not exertional dyspnea [D-36, P-1/P-5], absence of pain [D-36/P-5]. Missed: full absent symptoms (anxiety, sweating, impending doom [P-6/D-6]), SOB nuance [P-7], clinician screening citations [D-5/D-6], patient relief [P-35], combination rationale. Covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: condition and doctor quotes from [D-36]; patient tightness on breathing/walking from [P-1]; no pain from transcript [P-5]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by specifying condition and categorizing evidence into nature of complaints (tightness, no exertional SOB) and absences (no pain), with direct transcript support; no off-topic content."
