  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all core facts: COVID-19 as the condition both identified (with similar citations to P-1 and D-39), swab test ordered (D-39), 48-hour turnaround (D-39), and isolation instructions (D-39). Minor discrepancies include not explicitly calling it a 'COVID swab test' (though contextually clear), omitting 'today' for the test, missing D-2 citation for doctor's agreement, and not mentioning 'further instructions from public health'. Core facts are fully consistent, no errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: condition COVID-19 identified by both (P-1, D-39), doctor's agreement implied, swab test (D-39), 48 hours (D-39), stay isolated home/not see anyone (D-39). Missed: explicit D-2 citation, 'today' for test, 'further instructions from public health' (D-39), and the final contextual sentence on relevance. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: patient's COVID concern [P-1], doctor's COVID mention and swab/48 hours/isolation [D-39]. Citations accurate (P-1, D-39). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured in bullets directly addressing each part of the question (condition, test, turnaround, instructions) with no off-topic content or tangents."
