  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer correctly identifies several reported symptoms (dry cough, fever over 100°F, fatigue, decreased appetite, possible loss of taste) and partially captures the mother’s uncertainty about breathing. However, it contains factual/wording errors and overstatements: it implies shortness of breath/difficulty breathing was reported rather than clearly documenting it as uncertain (Gold: uncertain/decreased activity vs tiredness), and it incorrectly phrases appetite as if he “had a big appetite right now” (the transcript indicates the opposite). It also omits the reported mild runny nose, which is a factual omission rather than a direct contradiction.",
    "completeness": "It misses multiple key items present in the Gold Answer.\n\nReported symptoms missing:\n- Mild runny nose.\n- Clarification that swallowing difficulty was uncertain.\n\nExplicitly asked-and-denied symptoms missing (many):\n- No sputum or blood.\n- No wheezing.\n- No sore throat.\n- No chills/night sweats.\n- No rash/skin/hair/nail changes.\n- No nausea/vomiting.\n- No urinary changes.\n- No dizziness/fainting.\n- No confusion/memory loss.\n- Vision/hearing reported as fine.\n\nIt only includes chest pain/heart racing and some GI stool questions, so coverage is well under the majority of Gold’s pertinent negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "Most points cited are grounded in the transcript, but there are notable ungrounded elements: references to a “knowledge graph provided” and the claim that this “aligns with the knowledge graph indicating tiredness can cause shortness of breath” are not supported by the transcript. Additionally, the appetite phrasing misrepresents the transcript. Overall, it is only partially faithful.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely focused on the question (reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and denied symptoms). However, it includes an irrelevant item (family history lung/heart conditions) that was not asked for in the prompt’s examples, and it fails to address several explicitly asked-about negatives central to the question (e.g., wheezing, sore throat, chills, nausea/vomiting), which reduces how well it addresses the asked scope."
