  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer’s core facts: the patient did not try any OTC meds/treatments before the visit, and the clinician recommended a COVID-19 swab test with guidance that results may take 1–2 days and that the patient should self-isolate until results return (and possibly longer if symptoms persist despite a negative test). No contradictory or clinically incorrect statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) no self-treatment/OTC meds tried; (2) COVID-19 diagnostic swab test recommended; (3) results may take a day or two; (4) self-isolate until results and potentially longer if symptomatic. \nKey points missed/understated: (a) the patient also stated they take no regular medications (Gold notes this explicitly); (b) the clinician mentioned there might be additional tests and that they would review with the supervising doctor before finalizing the plan. These omissions keep it from full completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements in the Generated Answer are supported by the transcript (notably D-39 for the swab, timeline, and isolation; P-9 for no attempted treatments). It does not add unsupported medications or treatments. The mention of a “knowledge graph” is extraneous but does not introduce factual hallucinations about care.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what was asked: what the patient tried on their own and what the doctor recommended/prescribed including instructions. No meaningful tangents."
