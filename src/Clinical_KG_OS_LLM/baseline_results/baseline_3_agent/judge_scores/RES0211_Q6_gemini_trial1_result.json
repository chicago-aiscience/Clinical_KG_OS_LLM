  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the core clinical findings mentioned (3-4 day dry cough, fever, headache) and the general goal discussed (next steps). These facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key clinical findings recapped by the doctor: the absence of sputum production, the specific mention of the brother's cold, the absence of asthma, and the current medication list (Claritin only). It also omits Jessica's specific goal regarding whether she needs medicine and her desire to go home and rest. It covers approximately 30-40% of the key points in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is directly grounded in the provided transcript, specifically referencing the doctor's summary in [D-58] and the subsequent interaction.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question without including irrelevant information, though it lacks the depth of the Gold Answer's detail. It focuses exclusively on the requested summary and goal identification."
