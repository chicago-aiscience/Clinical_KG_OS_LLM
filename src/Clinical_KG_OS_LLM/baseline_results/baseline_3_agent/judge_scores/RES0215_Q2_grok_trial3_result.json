  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient takes occasional Reactine (OTC) for seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36], no medications for the current respiratory episode, and no prescribed medications [P-36, P-46, P-47], aligning with the Gold Answer's core facts. However, it inaccurately describes the current presentation as 'evaluation for a viral infection' [P-1, P-15 misapplied], as the transcript indicates past infections were viral but the current wheezing is undiagnosed and without fever or sick contacts. It also implies Reactine is 'currently part of her regimen,' overstating the occasional use. These are minor to moderate discrepancies, but core facts on medications are accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: no meds/treatments for current episodes (resolves on own implied), occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36], no prescribed medications [P-36, P-46, P-47]. Partially covers past viral infections requiring no antibiotics indirectly via no evidence of prescriptions. Misses explicit mention of episodes resolving on their own [P-33, P-34] and detailed reaffirmation of no regular meds [P-47]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine OTC for allergies verifiable [P-35, P-36]; no meds for current [P-34]; no prescribed [P-36, P-46, P-47]; citations accurate. Hallucinations include reference to non-existent '[KG]' for Reactine details, incorrectly labeling current issue as 'viral infection' causing symptoms (P-15 refers to past infections only), and phrasing Reactine as 'regimen' not matching 'occasional' use. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements present.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications for current respiratory episodes (none), other conditions (OTC Reactine for allergies), and prescribed meds (none), with structured summary matching question. Minor off-topic tangent on viral infection but remains focused on query."
