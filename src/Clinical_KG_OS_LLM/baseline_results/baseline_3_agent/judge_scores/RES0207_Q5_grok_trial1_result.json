  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies hereditary risk (epilepsy runs in family, mom had it) and medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose due to birthday disruption) as key factors, linking family history directly to genetic predisposition consistent with patient's chronic epilepsy. Generated Answer accurately covers these core facts with citations (P-9, P-23 for med; P-26 for family), but introduces a minor discrepancy by stating the seizure 'confirms the diagnosis' rather than it being a pre-existing chronic condition with the seizure as an acute episode due to missed med; patient presents epilepsy as established (P-8, P-9). Core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: hereditary (family runs, mom [P-26]); med non-adherence (Keppra [P-23], missed due to birthday [P-24], infrequent seizures when adherent [P-9], well-controlled normally); family relates as genetic predisposition to diagnosis; combination caused episode. Generated covers med non-adherence and link to seizure, hereditary (mom), family as predisposition/context for susceptibility to diagnosis; misses specific reason for missing dose (birthday), note on infrequent seizures/well-control, clinician question phrasing, explicit combination emphasis. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable: Keppra (P-23), missed med link (P-9), family/mom (P-26), self-reported epilepsy post-seizure (P-8). No hallucinations; 'genetic predisposition' is grounded in 'runs in the family'; interpretation of seizure confirming diagnosis is plausible from P-8 but interpretive, not fabricated. Citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured to directly address the question: sections on med risk factor, hereditary risk factor, and explicit relation of family history to diagnosis, with no off-topic content or tangents."
