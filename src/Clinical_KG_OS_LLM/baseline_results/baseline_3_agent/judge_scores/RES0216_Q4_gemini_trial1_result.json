  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemic) and the reasons provided by the doctor in the summary statement (D-36), including the distinction between tightness and breathlessness, and the absence of pain. It is fully consistent with the facts in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer captures the main points of the Gold Answer but omits the patient's denial of anxiety, sweating, and impending doom (P-6), which the Gold Answer includes as part of the clinical evidence for deprioritizing the condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using direct quotes and correct citations for D-36 and P-1. It does not hallucinate information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question (the condition and the symptom findings/absences)."
