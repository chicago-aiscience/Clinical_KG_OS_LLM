  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core symptoms (dry cough [P-1,P-4], scratchy throat [P-4], headache [P-1]) and absence of sputum (referencing [D-58], grounded in earlier [P-5,P-6]), aligning with Gold's emphasis on these supporting URI. It correctly notes exclusion of systemic symptoms but inaccurately claims patient does not 'explicitly list' GI absences or joint pain (patient denies in [P-11,P-12,P-13]); minor issues with 'Knowledge Graph' reference (not in Gold/transcript) and specifying 'common cold' vs. Gold's 'URI'; subjective fever is implied via [D-58] but lacks Gold's detailed citations [P-7,P-9]. Core facts consistent, minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covers key presenting symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache) and absences (sputum, infers GI/joint pain via [D-58]); addresses doctor's summary [D-58]. Misses Gold's details on subjective fever persistence [P-7,P-9], malaise [P-14,D-15], fatigue [P-13], 3-4 day timeline [P-1,P-3], and brother exposure [P-39]. Covers ~85% of Gold's points focused on question's symptoms/absences.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: symptoms verifiable [P-1,P-4]; sputum absence in transcript [P-5,P-6,D-58]; doctor's focus [D-58]. Minor issues: sputum question misattributed solely to [D-58] (earlier in [D-5,D-6]); 'patient does not explicitly list' GI/joint absences false (explicit denials [P-11-P-13]); 'Knowledge Graph' hallucinated/not in transcript. Mostly verifiable, some unverifiable details plausible.",
    "relevance": "Directly explains how listed symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache) and absences (sputum, GI/joint pain) support URI assessment with structured logic tied to transcript; no off-topic content despite minor extraneous 'Knowledge Graph'."
