  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) matching the Gold Answer's list, and correctly lists the five explicitly denied symptoms (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing). However, it includes a factual error in the supporting evidence by claiming the patient did not answer the neck stiffness question directly (contradicting [P-7]: 'No'), and provides no citations for the explicit denials, unlike the Gold's precise citations and details on timing/sequence/clarifications (e.g., stuffy nose first, fever duration, no joint pain). Minor to some factual errors, core identifications correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: four symptoms listed (100%); five denied symptoms listed (100%). Missed: detailed descriptions (stuffy nose first before fever [P-1,D-2,D-3]; sore throat persistent/not going away [P-1]; fever 'terrible' for 3 days [P-1]; muscle aches 2-3 days coinciding with fever [P-13-16], clarification no joint pain [P-13]); explicit denial citations ([P-10 cough, P-8 headaches, P-7 neck stiffness, P-5 nausea/vomiting, P-24-26 difficulty swallowing]); other denials mentioned in Gold. Covers ~70% of key points (lists but lacks depth/citations).",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms verifiable with accurate citations [P-1, P-13]. Denied list verifiable via transcript turns. However, hallucinated claim: 'patient immediately began reporting her own history without answering [D-7] neck stiffness, implying lack' - directly contradicts [P-7] 'No.' No citations for explicit denials (e.g., omits [P-10], [P-8], etc.), relying on absence in initial history; minor unverifiable implications but key error is fabricated narrative about unanswering. Some hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing the exact four reported symptoms and the five specified clinically significant symptoms denied, with supporting evidence section; no off-topic content, perfectly focused despite format."
