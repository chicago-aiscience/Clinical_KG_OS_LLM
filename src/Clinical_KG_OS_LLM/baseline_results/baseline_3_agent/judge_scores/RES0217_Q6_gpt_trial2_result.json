  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the main components of the plan: (1) quick physical exam, (2) send tick for species ID, (3) Lyme serology/titres blood work, (4) prophylactic antibiotics given likely >72h attachment and risk area, (5) clinician will speak with an attending physician, and (6) preventive garden advice (long grass/edge habitat; consider insecticide). Minor inaccuracies: it implies the clinician would consult a “specialist” (not stated; transcript indicates speaking with “the doctor”/physician), and it overstates timing/commitment (“initiating a course… immediately”) when the transcript is more conditional (“likely… going to have to put you on antibiotics”). It also cites D-5 for items not stated there (see faithfulness).",
    "completeness": "Includes all key elements from the Gold Answer: physical exam, tick sent to lab, Lyme bloodwork, prophylactic antibiotics without specifying drug/dose, plan to talk to/confirm with a physician, and preventive advice about tick habitat and possible insecticide. It does not explicitly mention the geographic risk reasoning (Strathroy/map) that supported antibiotics in the Gold Answer, but the treatment rationale is still largely represented (72+ hours attachment). Overall coverage is high but not perfect.",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is grounded in the transcript, but there are notable citation and grounding issues: (1) It cites [D-5] for sending the tick to the lab and for antibiotics/72-hour rationale—those are stated in [D-6] and [D-18], not [D-5]. (2) “specialist” is not mentioned in the transcript (only “the doctor/physician”). (3) “scheduled” physical exam and “confirm the risk” are reasonable paraphrases, but not verbatim. These issues make the answer somewhat less reliably grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by summarizing the end-of-visit plan across diagnostics (lab + physical), treatment, planned physician consultation, and preventive outdoor/garden advice, with no meaningful irrelevant content."
