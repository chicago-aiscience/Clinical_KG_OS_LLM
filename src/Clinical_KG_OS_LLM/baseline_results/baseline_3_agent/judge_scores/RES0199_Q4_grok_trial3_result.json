  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the condition as COVID (consistent with Gold's COVID-19 and transcript's 'covid'), the test as a swab (exact match), turnaround time as 24 to 48 hours (exact), and alternative as another viral illness (exact match). All facts align fully with no errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: rule out COVID-19, swab test, 24-48 hours TAT, alternative another viral illness (core to question). Supplementary in Gold: isolate 14 days, positive result actions, supportive management. Generated covers 100% of question's core points (condition, test+TAT, alt diagnosis) directly from Gold.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52]: 'rule out covid', 'symptoms overlap', 'take a swab... 24 to 48 hours', 'if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness'. Citations accurate, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured perfectly to address the exact question components (condition, test+TAT, alt diagnosis) with no off-topic content or tangents."
