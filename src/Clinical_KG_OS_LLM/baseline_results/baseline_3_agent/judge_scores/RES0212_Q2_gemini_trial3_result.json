  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct in stating that the patient uses condoms and has not been prescribed medication for her current cough symptoms. However, it fails to mention the patient's eczema history and the associated treatments (current moisturizing creams and previous prescriptions from Shoppers Drug Mart), which were specifically asked for in the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers very little of the information provided in the gold answer. It misses the eczema treatments (both current non-prescription and previous prescription), the explicit denial of current medications (P-29), the possible allergies, and the reported substance use (marijuana and alcohol) which are included in the gold answer's comprehensive view of treatments and current status.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript for the two points it includes. It correctly cites P-45 and D-47. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question but is far too narrow. It ignores several 'treatments' and 'previously prescribed' medications (for eczema) that were explicitly mentioned in the transcript and requested by the prompt."
