  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly describes the timeline: cough began Wednesday night as a mild dry cough; persisted Thursday with worsening and notable tiredness; worsened further Friday with fever >100°F and decreased appetite and possible loss of taste. These align with the Gold Answer. Minor issues: it adds an interpretive note about “perhaps struggling slightly with breathing,” which is only weakly supported (parent speculated it could be harder to breathe but attributed it to fatigue). No direct factual contradictions otherwise.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key Gold Answer points: onset Wednesday evening/night; cough worsening over Thurs/Fri; fever first appearing Friday with temp ~100.1–101; fatigue and decreased appetite Friday; possible loss of taste Friday. Misses: mild runny nose on Friday (Gold includes [P-16]); does not explicitly mention the mother’s correction from “five days” to “three days” ([P-4]) or the explicit stepwise summary in [P-12]. Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. Minor drift: the phrasing about breathing difficulty is somewhat speculative, and the mention that “presence of fever and a dry cough aligns with viral indicators” is a reasonable inference but not explicitly stated as such in the transcript. Also includes extraneous mention of the doctor inquiring about chest pain/heart racing, which is true but not needed for the asked timeline. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Largely focused on the requested day-by-day evolution of cough, fever onset, fatigue, and appetite changes. However, it includes some tangential content (doctor’s questions about chest pain/heart racing, isolation/COVID swab recommendations) that is not asked for, slightly reducing focus."

  "summary": "A mostly accurate, well-structured day-by-day timeline that captures the main symptom progression, but misses a couple of Gold details (runny nose, explicit 3-day correction/summary) and includes minor speculation and tangential information."
