{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript. It correctly identifies the timeline of the cough (4-5 days) and the runny nose (past couple of days), as well as the clear nature of the discharge and the lack of severity change in the cough.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the specific qualitative comparison the patient made in P-24, where he stated he 'never had like a dry cough like this' and that previous runny noses 'never lasted this long.' While it mentions asthma and fever history, it misses these direct comparisons of the current symptoms to past ones. It also fails to explicitly state the cough was 'dry' in the first section, though it's implied.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are well-supported by the transcript and the citations [P-2, P-11, P-12, P-13, P-28, D-37, D-39] are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question, but it includes an extra section on 'Planned Interventions' (X-rays and COVID swabs) which was not requested by the prompt. The prompt asked for symptom development and comparison to prior experiences, not the diagnostic plan."
