  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the 'bronchodilator' as the medication. However, it fails on the other two parts of the question. It incorrectly states that the administration method is not specified, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions it is a 'puffer' (D-7, P-7). It also incorrectly claims the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication, whereas the doctor specifically asks if there is 'one that you take every day no matter what' (D-5).",
    "completeness": "The answer only successfully addresses the name of the medication. It fails to provide the administration method and the description of the daily controller medication, both of which were present in the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains hallucinations of omission. It claims the transcript 'does not specify' or 'does not contain evidence' for information that is clearly present in segments D-5, D-7, P-5, and P-7. This contradicts the source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it attempts to answer all three parts of the multi-part question, although its conclusions regarding two of those parts are factually incorrect based on the provided text."
