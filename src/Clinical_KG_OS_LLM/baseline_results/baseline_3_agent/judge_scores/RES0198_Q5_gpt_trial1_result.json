  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The key exposure source in the Gold Answer is the nephew who attends daycare and lives with the patient; the Generated Answer incorrectly identifies “COVID-19” as the exposure source. While it is true the clinician considered COVID-19 and ordered a swab with isolation instructions (D-39), this is not an exposure identified through social history. The Generated Answer also implies immune-function implications of type 1 diabetes were emphasized by the physician; the Gold Answer notes no explicit linkage in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Misses the central Gold Answer point: daycare-attending nephew living with the patient as a plausible respiratory viral exposure (P-11), including the nuance that the nephew wasn’t sick but still could be a source (P-12). It also omits several contextual diabetes/social-history details present in the Gold Answer (endocrinologist follow-up, no other meds, etc.) and the note that immune-risk was not explicitly discussed. It includes some correct but secondary elements (COVID test, isolation, hydration advice).",
    "faithfulness": "Statements about COVID testing, supportive care, hydration, and isolation are grounded in D-39, and diabetes is grounded in P-23/P-25. However, calling COVID-19 the identified “exposure source” is not supported by the transcript, and the answer adds an ungrounded claim that diabetes-related immune impairment specifically drove management emphasis (the transcript does not make that connection).",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on an infectious exposure source and how it relates to the current presentation with type 1 diabetes. However, it does not answer the specific ‘social history exposure source’ correctly, which reduces how well it addresses the question’s intent."
