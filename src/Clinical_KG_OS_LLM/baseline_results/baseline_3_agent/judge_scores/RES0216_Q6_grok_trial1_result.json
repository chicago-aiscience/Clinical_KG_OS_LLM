  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states doctor's assessment as asthma reoccurring 'in some capacity' at top of differential pending exam/findings (D-35). Generated correctly captures asthma as primary suspicion and cardiac lower (D-36), but inaccurately claims doctor notes symptoms feel 'different' (actually patient's words P-16), misrepresents patient currently 'utilizes rescue inhalers' (patient lacks rescue, uses only daily controller P-17/P-18/P-25), and says 'continue to have rescue puffers' instead of 'try having available' implying obtain them (D-35). Minor to some factual errors, core assessment correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Assessment as top differential pending findings (covered); 2) Phys exam: quick exam, listen lungs, further inv (covers exam/lungs, misses further inv nuance); 3) Initial tx: obtain/use rescue on walks as trial, notes no current rescue (covers recommendation/use on walks, misses lack of current supply); 4) Contingency: if no help, reassess/other directions/stepwise (covered); 5) Consult supervising doc (missed). Covers ~85% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verifies: assessment tentative asthma top barring new findings (D-35, matches); phys exam lungs (D-35); rescue trial if available (D-35, but patient lacks per P-17/18); contingency reassess (D-35/36). Hallucinations: 'doctor notes feels different' (patient P-16); 'utilizes rescue inhalers [P-25]' (P-25 lists salbutamol but context no current rescue use/refill); 'continue to have' implies current use (contradicts). Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured precisely around question elements: assessment, phys exam components, first-step treatment, contingency; no off-topic content, perfectly focused."
