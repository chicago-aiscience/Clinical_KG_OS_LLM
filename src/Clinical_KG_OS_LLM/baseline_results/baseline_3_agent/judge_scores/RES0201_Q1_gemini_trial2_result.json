  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript does not contain explicit denials for cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, or chest pain. In the transcript, the patient explicitly denies cough (P-15), runny nose (P-16), headaches (P-17), chest pain (P-18), and fever (P-23).",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete as it misses two major reported symptoms: difficulty breathing (P-8) and muscle aches/fatigue (P-25). It also fails to list almost all the symptoms the patient denied, which was specifically requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of information. It states that there are no explicit statements of denial for several symptoms when those statements are clearly present in the provided transcript lines.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses both parts of the question (reported symptoms and denied symptoms), but because it fails to find the relevant information in the text, the content of the response is largely incorrect and unhelpful."
