  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the start of the headache and cough as four days ago, the loss of smell as one day ago, and the general onset of gastrointestinal symptoms as a few days back. It accurately reflects that the cough remained stable.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a few specific details found in the gold answer. Specifically, it does not mention the precise two-day timeline for the onset of diarrhea (P-28), grouping it generally under 'few days back'. It also omits the specific detail that the headache severity 'stayed around the same' (P-9), though it notes it was 'pretty persistent'.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript. All timestamps and symptoms provided (4 days, 1 day, etc.) are directly supported by the text and cited correctly with patient identifiers.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the question: the four-day development, the first symptoms, the timing of GI and smell symptoms, and the stability of the headache and cough over time."
