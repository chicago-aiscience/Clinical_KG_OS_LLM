  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript does not specify the administration method, whereas D-7 and P-7 explicitly confirm it is a 'puffer'. Furthermore, it incorrectly states there is no evidence of the doctor asking about a daily controller medication, missing the direct question in D-5 ('do you have one that you take every day no matter what?').",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the bronchodilator but fails to provide the administration method (puffer) and completely misses the specific inquiry about the daily controller medication, which were both key parts of the question and the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains hallucinations of omission, claiming the transcript lacks information that is clearly present in exchanges D-5, P-5, and D-7.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address all parts of the prompt but provides incorrect information for two out of the three components requested."
