{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the onset, mucus characteristics, and the transition to a dry cough. However, it omits the fact that the cough intensity remained stable, which is a core detail in the gold answer and specifically requested by the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points present in the gold answer: the stability of cough intensity, the specific frequency (3-4 times per hour), the absence of fever, the negative COVID-19 test, and the lack of specific triggers. It covers approximately 60% of the information provided in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All claims regarding the timeline of flu symptoms, mucus color, and the transition of the cough are supported by the patient's statements and correctly cited.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant but fails to address a specific part of the prompt: how the cough's intensity changed over time. It also focuses on frequency without explicitly stating that it remained stable, as noted in the gold answer."
