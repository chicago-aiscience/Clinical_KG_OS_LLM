  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core management measures: COVID swab test with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation, and isolation from the younger sister. All these facts align with the Gold Answer. The mention of ER precautions is correct but less detailed than the Gold Answer. The reference to asthma in [D-45] is contextually accurate - the doctor mentioned it as a differential if symptoms were different, though this is a minor point not emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points: diagnostic test (COVID swab), isolation duration (14 days), specific household member to isolate from (younger sister), and return-to-care precautions. However, it omits several details from the Gold Answer: the possibility of false-negative results, that negative results could indicate another viral illness, the school's requirement for testing, the mother's acknowledgment about supportive care for viral illnesses, no medications prescribed, and the supportive/observational approach. The ER precautions are mentioned but less comprehensively detailed.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The COVID swab recommendation [D-44], 14-day isolation [D-44], isolation from younger sister [D-44], and ER precautions [D-44] are all directly supported. The asthma mention [D-45] is correctly contextualized. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: diagnostic tests (COVID swab), isolation instructions and duration (14 days), and specific household member mentioned for isolation (younger sister). The additional information about ER precautions and asthma consideration is relevant contextual information. No off-topic content is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and highly faithful to the transcript with perfect citations. It directly addresses all components of the clinical question with relevant information. The main limitation is incomplete coverage of contextual details from the Gold Answer, including false-negative possibility, school requirements, supportive care approach, and comprehensive ER precaution details. Despite missing approximately 40% of the Gold Answer's key points, the core clinical management measures are captured correctly."
