  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the patient tried OTC decongestants and reported they “worked a little bit,” and it correctly states the physician recommended an OTC product “like Tylenol Cold.” These align with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "For the asked question (what tried, how effective, what OTC recommended), the generated answer includes all required elements: decongestants, partial benefit (“a little bit”), and Tylenol Cold recommendation. It does not mention hydration/expected duration, but those are not necessary to answer the question as posed.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are supported by the transcript: decongestants and perceived partial effect come from [P-10], and Tylenol Cold recommendation comes from [D-39]. No extra unsupported claims are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the specific medication tried, the patient’s assessment of effectiveness, and the doctor’s OTC recommendation, directly addressing the question."
