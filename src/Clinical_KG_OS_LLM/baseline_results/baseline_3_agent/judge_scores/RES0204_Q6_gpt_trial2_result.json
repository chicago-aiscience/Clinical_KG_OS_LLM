  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the overall plan structure (talk/exam → get supervising doctor → return with next steps) and the two proposed diagnostics (chest X‑ray and COVID nasal swab). A minor inaccuracy/overstatement is the claim that the clinician would return to “present the findings from the tests”; the transcript only states they will arrange the tests and then return with the supervising physician to discuss next steps, without explicitly stating results would be available or reviewed at that point.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) plan to arrange chest X‑ray, (2) plan to do COVID swab, (3) plan to consult the supervising physician and return, (4) plan to discuss “where to go from here.”\nKey points missed or under-specified vs Gold: (a) explicit mention of the planned lung/heart exam at the outset, (b) the reassurance/age-appropriate framing (bravery, not fun, etc.) is only partially captured, and (c) the closing thanks/ending is omitted (minor). Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript. The main partially ungrounded element is the implication that the clinician will return with test findings; the transcript indicates arranging tests and returning to discuss next steps, not necessarily reviewing results. Otherwise, no major hallucinated tests or steps are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the requested elements: diagnostic tests, supervising-physician consultation, and follow-up/next steps. No meaningful irrelevant content."
