  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with both the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the diagnostic tests (X-ray and COVID swab), the role of the supervising physician, and the follow-up process.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a few minor points from the gold answer and transcript: 1) The specific mention of performing a physical examination of the lungs and heart [D-1]. 2) The patient and mother's agreement to the plan [P-40]. 3) The closing thank-you from the doctor [D-41]. However, it covers the primary diagnostic and consultation components of the plan.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited. There are no hallucinations or external information added.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing strictly on the components of the medical plan as requested by the prompt."
