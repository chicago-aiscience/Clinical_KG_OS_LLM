{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding the use of condoms and the fact that no medications have been prescribed for the current cough. However, it fails to identify that the patient was previously prescribed a cream for eczema (Shoppers Drug Mart) and currently uses moisturizing creams, both of which are directly requested by the prompt ('medications or treatments... currently using or has previously been prescribed').",
    "completeness": "The response is highly incomplete. It misses the patient's eczema history (current moisturizing cream and past prescription cream), her explicit statement that she takes no regular medications, her substance use (marijuana vape and alcohol), and her allergy status. It only covers one aspect (contraception) out of approximately nine key points mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the transcript. There are no hallucinations; the response correctly identifies the use of condoms and the lack of new prescriptions during the visit.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question but suffers from an extremely narrow scope, focusing only on 'current symptoms' rather than the full medical history requested by the prompt."
