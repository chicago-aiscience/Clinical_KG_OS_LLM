  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the two diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID-19 swab) with correct citations and descriptions matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-37, D-39]. It correctly notes the consultation with the supervising physician [D-1, D-37, D-40]. However, it omits the physical examination of lungs and heart explicitly stated in the initial plan [D-1] and Gold Answer, and slightly misphrases the chest X-ray as 'perform' rather than 'might want to do' and arrange. It infers 'present the findings from the tests,' but tests are to be arranged post-consultation, a minor discrepancy. Core facts are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covered: two diagnostic tests (chest X-ray, COVID swab) with explanations; consultation (go get supervising doctor, discuss next steps); follow-up (return to discuss plan). Missed: explicit mention of physical exam (listen to lungs/heart) in initial plan structure [D-1]; age-appropriate explanations emphasized in Gold; patient/mother acknowledgment [P-40]; concluding thanks [D-41,42]; phrasing of 'arrange for these things.' Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable: tests proposed [D-37,39], explanations [D-39], consultation steps [D-1,37,40]. Minor issues: 'perform a chest X-ray' (transcript says 'might want to do' and 'arrange'); 'present the findings from the tests' (tests not yet performed, exam pending); 'return the patient to health' (grounded in [D-37] but paraphrased). Citations accurate, no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around diagnostic tests, consultation, and follow-up steps, precisely matching the question with no off-topic content or tangents."
