  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the plan stated in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function tests, ABGs, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation measurement with supplemental oxygen as needed, continuation of bronchodilators, and addition of steroids and antibiotics, plus a COVID swab due to overlapping symptoms. No statements contradict the Gold Answer. Minor presentation issue: it categorizes the COVID swab under “Monitoring,” whereas the Gold Answer treats it as an ordered test; however, the action itself is correct and supported by [D-52].",
    "completeness": "It includes essentially all key COPD-exacerbation management elements from [D-52] (labs: CBC/electrolytes/kidney function/ABG; imaging: CXR; monitoring: O2 saturation; treatment: O2 PRN, bronchodilators continued, steroids, antibiotics; COVID swab and turnaround time concept though not the timing). It omits the additional monitoring/counsel from [D-37] about ongoing blood pressure monitoring due to stopping antihypertensives and kidney-complication caution, which is included in the Gold Answer as an additional plan element.",
    "faithfulness": "All included items are directly grounded in the transcript: diagnostic tests and treatments in [D-52], and bronchodilators Ventolin/Spiriva identified in [P-11]. No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested comprehensive COPD exacerbation plan (tests, imaging, monitoring, and therapies). No substantive irrelevant content."
