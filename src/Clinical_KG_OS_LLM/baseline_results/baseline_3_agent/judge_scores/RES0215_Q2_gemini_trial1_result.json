  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Reactine and the lack of prescribed medications. However, it incorrectly states the patient is 'currently being evaluated for a viral infection' citing [P-15]. In the transcript, [P-15] refers to past infections from the last two years, whereas the current episode is for wheezing and cough of unknown cause. Additionally, it states the transcript 'does not mention taking any specific medications' for the current episode, whereas the transcript explicitly confirms that the mother does not give her anything [P-34].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main medications (Reactine/OTC) and the lack of prescriptions. It misses the detail from the Gold Answer regarding the lack of antibiotic use for past viral infections. It also fails to explicitly state that the current symptoms resolve with rest without treatment, opting instead for a 'no evidence' statement.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' [KG] as a source for the purpose of Reactine, which is not present in the provided transcript. It also misattributes information about past viral infections [P-15] to the current clinical evaluation.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question regarding current/other medications and the status of prescribed medications."
