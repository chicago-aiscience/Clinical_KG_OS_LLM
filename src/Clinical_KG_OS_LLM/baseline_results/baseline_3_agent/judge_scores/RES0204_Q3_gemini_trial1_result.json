  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the duration of the cough and the reason for the COVID swab (institutional protocol for specific symptoms). However, it fails to explain how the absence of symptoms (fever, chills, sore throat, etc.) influenced the diagnostic logic, whereas the Gold Answer explains that the tests were ordered despite the lack of high-acuity markers or specific COVID indicators like anosmia.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses almost all the 'absent findings' mentioned in the prompt and the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the absence of fever, chills, sore throat, loss of taste/smell, chest pain, and muscle aches, which were specifically asked for in the question. It also omits the family history of asthma and the novelty of the cough as factors for the X-ray.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally grounded in the transcript, but it introduces 'Knowledge Graph' information about the location of procedures which is not present in the source text. While logically sound, this is external data not found in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant but fails to address a key part of the prompt: how the 'absent findings' led to the workup. The question specifically asked about the combination of present and absent findings, but the generated answer focuses almost entirely on the present symptoms."
