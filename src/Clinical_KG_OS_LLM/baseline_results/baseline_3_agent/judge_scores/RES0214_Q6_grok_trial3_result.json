  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the COVID-19 swab order [D-53] and self-isolation recommendations for both patient and husband [D-53, D-54], matching the Gold Answer. However, for next steps, it vaguely references 'further investigation' and 'work this up further' [D-53], omitting the specific physical exam [D-52] and consulting the supervising doctor [D-55] mentioned in Gold. No factual contradictions, but incomplete representation of the plan.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) COVID swab (covered), 2) self-isolation for patient and husband (covered fully), 3) physical exam as next step (missed), 4) consult supervising physician and return (missed), 5) patient agreement (minor, missed). Covers ~50% of key points (test and precautions fully, next steps not).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about swab, isolation, and further investigation are directly verifiable in [D-53]; citations accurate. Minor issue: references 'knowledge graph' not present in transcript (unverifiable detail), but core content grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around the question's elements (test, precautions for patient/husband, next steps); no off-topic content."
