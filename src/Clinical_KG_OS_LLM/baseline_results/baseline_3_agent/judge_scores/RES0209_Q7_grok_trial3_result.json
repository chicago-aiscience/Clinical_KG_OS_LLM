  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details diagnosis at age 8 (now 10), baseline bronchodilator use once every two weeks, triggers (exercise/cold/seasonal), and two-week exacerbation with specific symptoms (nonstop dry cough, increased wheezing, SOB, chest tightness), escalated use to 5-6 times/week, wheezing exceeding use, nighttime symptoms, no precipitant. Generated Answer misses ages/diagnosis timing, exact baseline/current frequencies, two-week duration clarification, wheezing > use, nighttime symptoms, and no precipitant; incorrectly cites chest tightness to [P-4] instead of [P-20]; presents triggers as exacerbation-specific rather than baseline; adds unmentioned 'diagnosis of asthma exacerbation' and '[Knowledge Graph]'; main escalation point correct but significant omissions and errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: escalation in symptoms (cough, wheezing, SOB, chest tightness partially), bronchodilator increase vaguely ('near-daily'), some triggers. Missed: diagnosis age 8/now 10, baseline 'once every two weeks', current 'five-six times a week', two-week duration (says 'past week'), wheezing frequency exceeds use, nighttime symptoms every other/two days, no precipitant. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: cough/SOB/wheezing [P-1,P-15], triggers [P-9,P-11], increased use [P-1,P-8 implied]. Errors: chest tightness cited [P-4] (wrong, unrelated; actual [P-20]), usage cites [P-9] not precise freq from [P-8]; 'nonstop cough past week' [P-1] but later clarified two weeks [P-13]; adds 'diagnosis of asthma exacerbation' and '[Knowledge Graph]' not in transcript; family history [P-32] verifiable but tangential. Some unverifiable/plausible claims and citation inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "Addresses current symptoms and usage escalation somewhat but fails to detail temporal evolution (initial diagnosis, specific baseline vs. current frequencies as in question); focuses on current exacerbation state/triggers/diagnosis rather than progression; includes irrelevant family history and Knowledge Graph."
