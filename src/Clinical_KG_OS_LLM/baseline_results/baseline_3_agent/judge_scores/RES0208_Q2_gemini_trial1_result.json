  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the gold answer, identifying the correct medications (Avodart, Tums), their respective conditions (prostate enlargement, reflux), and the specifics of the dietary change.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers 100% of the information requested in the prompt. Compared to the gold answer, it misses minor secondary details such as the specific mention that the prostate condition is not cancer, the doctor's positive reaction to the dietary change, and the patient's allergy status. Given the gold answer as the benchmark, it covers approximately 80% of its content.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical claims are verifiable in the source transcript (P-25, P-26, P-27). The meta-comment regarding a knowledge graph is not in the transcript but does not result in any factual inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant and focused, addressing the multi-part question about medications and regimen changes without any irrelevant content."
