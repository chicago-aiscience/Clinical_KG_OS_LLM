  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms of pneumonia (productive cough, purulent sputum, fever, chills, and pleuritic chest pain). However, it contains a significant factual error: it attributes the description of a 'raw' feeling from an 'awful lot of coughing' [P-15] to pleuritic chest pain, whereas the transcript clearly indicates this was a response to a question about a sore throat. It fails to cite the actual evidence for pleuritic pain (worsening with deep breaths and coughing) found in [P-18] and [P-19].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two major components found in the Gold Answer: exertional dyspnea (feeling 'winded' and 'crummy' after stairs [P-10, P-11]) and the predisposing risk factor of a long-term smoking history [P-37, P-38]. It covers approximately 60% of the key points provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a connection between [P-15] and pleuritic chest pain. In the transcript, [P-15] refers to a sore throat ('it starts to feel a little raw'), not the right-sided chest pain. By linking this 'raw' feeling to the mechanism of pleurisy, the answer misrepresents the patient's testimony.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question regarding specific transcript findings and the diagnostic reasoning for pneumonia."
