  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19) and the test (COVID test) with its negative result. However, it is less precise than the Gold Answer regarding the timing; the patient specifically stated the test was done 'when I first started having symptoms', whereas the generated answer generalizes this as 'during this 2-week duration'. It also misses the specific job role of 'clerk'.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main points but misses several nuances from the Gold Answer: the specific 'clerk' role, the patient's consistent use of PPE, the fact that the patient has been staying home waiting for symptoms to resolve, and the specific motivation for seeking medication (to return to work without coughing). It captures about 60% of the detail in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is grounded in the transcript. There are no hallucinations, though the interpretation of the timing is slightly less specific than the source text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all four parts of the question without including irrelevant information."
