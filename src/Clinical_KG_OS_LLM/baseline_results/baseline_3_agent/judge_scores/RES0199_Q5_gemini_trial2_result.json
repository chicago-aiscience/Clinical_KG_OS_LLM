  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect and directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer. It claims the doctor did not explore the living situation, workplace, or travel history, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about these in D-45, D-48, and D-49 respectively. It also claims the doctor did not ask about sick individuals, which happened in D-47 and D-50.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the apartment living situation, the car dealership workplace, the specific environmental triggers (mold, dust, etc.), and the denial of travel and sick contacts.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It claims certain discussions did not occur when they are explicitly documented in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it attempts to address the specific categories requested in the prompt (living situation, workplace, travel, sick contacts), although every conclusion it reaches is factually wrong."
