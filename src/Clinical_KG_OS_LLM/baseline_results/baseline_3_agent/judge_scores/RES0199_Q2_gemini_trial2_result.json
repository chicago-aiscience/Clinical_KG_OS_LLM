  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the medication taken for the headache. It also accurately lists the doctor's recommendations for supportive care (hydration, food, sleep), additional medications (Tylenol/NSAIDs for fever or pain), and the diagnostic/isolation plan (COVID swab, 14-day isolation). It correctly transcribes 'anseads' from the transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses one detail included in the Gold Answer: the fact that the patient had already self-initiated hydration efforts [P-30] before the visit. However, it covers all other aspects of the question and Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly faithful to the transcript. However, it mentions a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information, which is not present in the provided transcript or context, representing a minor hallucination of the source material's structure.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and thoroughly addresses all parts of the question, providing clear headings for the patient's pre-visit actions and the doctor's plan."
