  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer makes a significant error by consistently misgendering the patient (using 'he/his' instead of 'she/her'), despite the prompt and gold answer identifying the patient as female. Additionally, it introduces 'Knowledge Graph' terminology and structural triplets that are not part of the provided clinical consultation data.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the three main factors requested (family history, smoking, and stress) and provides a structured interaction analysis. However, it misses several specific details found in the Gold Answer, such as the patient living alone in London, the specific historical duration of her smoking habit (10 cigarettes/day for two years), and her history of teenage anxiety attacks.",
    "faithfulness": "The response hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source for its information, citing it multiple times for clinical associations. While the underlying clinical logic is plausible, these citations do not exist in the source transcript. The patient's gender is also misattributed.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant to the question's structure. It breaks down the three contributing factors as requested and provides a dedicated section to explain how they interact to cause the patient's concern."
