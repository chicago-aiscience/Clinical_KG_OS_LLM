  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists specific symptoms including dry cough [P-12], persistent headache [P-3,P-5], GI symptoms [P-1,P-28,P-32], fatigue [P-19], and loss of smell [P-24] as the constellation leading to COVID suspicion. Generated Answer lists headache, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea matching P-1 summary, but omits 'dry' cough detail, persistence, and fatigue; correctly identifies loss of smell as characteristic with accurate citation. Core facts align with doctor's statement [D-52] of overlapping symptoms, minor discrepancies in detail completeness.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: doctor's explicit statement [D-52]; symptoms (dry cough, persistent headache, GI, fatigue, loss of smell); doctor queried smell/taste [D-24]; anosmia characteristic; alternative diagnosis; pertinent negatives (no fever, no rhinorrhea, no myalgias). Generated covers main symptom combo from P-1 and [D-52], loss of smell as characteristic [P-24]; misses fatigue, dry cough specifier, pertinent negatives, alternative mention, query detail—covers ~80% of core symptom overlap and characteristic symptom.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: symptom combo from [P-1], doctor's suspicion [D-52], loss of smell [P-24]; citations accurate. Minor unverifiable element is the notation '[SYMPTOM] smell loss --[INDICATES]--> [DIAGNOSIS] covid' which is interpretive formatting not in transcript but does not fabricate facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both question parts: specifies symptom combination leading to COVID suspicion and identifies loss of smell as particularly characteristic; no off-topic content."
