  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual inaccuracies compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. Most importantly, it misinterprets P-20 to claim that the chest pain is exclusive to anxiety attacks; the transcript actually refers to heart fluttering in that context. It also misses the key characteristic that the pain occurs specifically when taking a deep breath, which is highlighted in the Gold Answer. Furthermore, it incorrectly states the pain does not occur at any other time, whereas the Gold Answer and transcript specify it occurs while walking or studying alone.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the 1.5-week duration of symptoms, the 'deep breath' trigger, the specific 'alone' context (walking to school/studying), and the specific resolution (talking to people/hands-on tasks). While it correctly identifies the 20-minute duration and the 'sharp/strong' quality, it fails to cover about 60% of the specific situational details provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a connection between the chest pain and anxiety attacks by misattributing the patient's statement about heart fluttering [P-20] to the chest pain. It also claims the pain is 'exclusive' to these attacks, which directly contradicts the patient's testimony in [P-4] and [P-29] regarding walking and studying.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to address the question's categories (quality, duration, triggers, resolution). However, because the content within those categories is largely inaccurate or misinterpreted, its utility in answering the question is compromised."
