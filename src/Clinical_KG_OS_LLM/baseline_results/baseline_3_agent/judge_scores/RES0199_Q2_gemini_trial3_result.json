  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer regarding the use of Tylenol for headaches, the doctor's recommendations for supportive care (hydration, nutrition, sleep), medications (antipyretics, Tylenol/NSAIDs), and the management of COVID-19 (swab and isolation).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses one specific detail from the gold answer: that the patient had already self-initiated hydration efforts ('trying to keep hydrated') before the doctor's recommendation. However, it covers all other key points including the COVID-19 test and isolation period.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. However, it mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the provided source text, though the medical relationship it describes is accurate to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and clearly addresses all components of the question: current medication, target symptom, and the doctor's recommended plan."
