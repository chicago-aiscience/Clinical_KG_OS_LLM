  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it attributes the 'raw' feeling to the chest [P-15], whereas the transcript clearly states this refers to a sore throat after coughing. It also misses the 'yellow custard' color of the sputum, only mentioning the red spots. It correctly identifies the location of the chest pain but fails to describe its quality (dull) as requested by the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The answer is missing several key details provided in the Gold Answer. It misses the specific description of the sputum as 'yellow custard', the quality of the chest pain ('dull' and 'constant'), and the systemic symptoms' timing. It also omits dyspnea on exertion and the history of a runny nose.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer misinterprets the transcript at [P-15], claiming the patient's chest felt raw when the patient was actually describing a sore throat. This is a hallucination of the symptom's location.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant as it attempts to address all parts of the question (sputum, pain, systemic symptoms), though it lacks the detail required for a comprehensive response."
