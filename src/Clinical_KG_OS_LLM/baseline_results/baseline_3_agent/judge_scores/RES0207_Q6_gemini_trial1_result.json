  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect. It claims that no doctor turns are present in the transcript and that it cuts off at turn [P-26]. In reality, the transcript provided includes doctor turns from [D-1] to [D-38], with the specific answer to the question contained in [D-37].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not mention the consultation with the other doctor, the plan to return shortly, the potential for tests, or the collaborative decision-making process.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the provided source. It hallucinates that the transcript is incomplete and consists only of patient turns, despite the clear presence of dialogue through turn [D-38].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is not relevant as it refuses to answer the prompt based on a false premise that the necessary information is missing from the text."
