  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer correctly identifies stuffy nose (on/off), runny nose for 1 week, initially stuffy now running, discharge 'mostly clear' [P-5], and explicit denials of cough [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills [P-7], loss of taste/smell [P-16]. Generated Answer accurately reports nasal symptoms and progression but incorrectly states discharge character is not specified (contradicts [P-5]), and claims denials lack explicit context despite clear doctor questions and patient 'No' responses in transcript; also includes minor extraneous doctor summary. Significant contradictions on key facts warrant score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: nasal symptoms (stuffy on/off, runny 1wk [P1-3]), clear discharge [P5], denied cough [P4], post-nasal [P6], sore throat etc [P7], loss taste/smell [P16]. Generated covers nasal symptoms (~50%) but entirely misses/negates discharge character and all specific denied symptoms (claims unconfirmable), covering <50% overall. Score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated nasal symptoms verifiable [P1,P3]; doctor summary [D39] ok. But 'discharge not specified' hallucinates absence when directly stated 'mostly clear' [P5:D5-P5]; denials cited [P4,P14,P16] but falsely claims 'context missing' despite preceding D questions [D4 cough, D6 post-nasal, D7 sore throat, D16 taste/smell] explicitly in transcript. Multiple ungrounded claims. Score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response into reported symptoms, discharge character, denied symptoms matching question's three parts; minor tangent on doctor's viral summary but focused. Score 4."
