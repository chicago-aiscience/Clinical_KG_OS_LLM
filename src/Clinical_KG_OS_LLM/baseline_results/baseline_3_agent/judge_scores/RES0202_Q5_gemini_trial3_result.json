  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several factual inaccuracies. It states the mother 'did not report' any specific sick contacts or that the school had notified her. However, the transcript (P-38, P-39) shows she explicitly reported that there were *no* known contacts outside of school and that the school *had not* contacted them. The generated answer's phrasing suggests she was silent on these topics, whereas she provided clear negative confirmations. Additionally, it misattributes information to [P-1] that occurs much later in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the school's requirement for a COVID test to notify other families (P-41), the uncertainty regarding school contacts versus the certainty of no outside contacts (P-38), and the exclusion of other sources like travel or environmental factors (P-37, P-40) which reinforce the school as the suspected source.",
    "faithfulness": "There are significant faithfulness issues. It hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the clinical transcript. Furthermore, the citations are incorrect; for instance, the mother's statement about school notification is in P-39, but the answer cites P-1. It also claims she didn't mention siblings falling ill, whereas she explicitly stated her daughter was healthy (P-36).",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to address the specific components of the question (source of illness, contacts, school notification), but the content within those sections is flawed."
