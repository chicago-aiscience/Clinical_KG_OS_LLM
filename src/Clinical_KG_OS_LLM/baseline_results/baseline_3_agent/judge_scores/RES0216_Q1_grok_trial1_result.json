  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses key details from the Gold Answer such as the three-day duration, diffuse nature of tightness ('all over' [P-8]), specific worsening triggers (walks, getting up from chair, deep breaths [P-9,P-10]), and precise dyspnea description ('whole breath' [P-7]). It incorrectly states that fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating have no explicit denials in the transcript, directly contradicting Gold and transcript evidence (P-6, P-12-P-15). Chest pain denial is partially accurate but cites P-1 instead of explicit P-5. These are significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: chest tightness (partial), dyspnea (partial), hoarseness/phlegm/throat clearing, cough denial, chest pain denial. Missed: duration (3 days), diffuse location, specific triggers for worsening, full breath difficulty detail, denials of anxiety/sweating/impending doom [P-6], fevers [P-12], night sweats [P-13], chills [P-14], weight loss [P-15], systematic elicitation context, and cardiac differential note. Covers approximately 30-40% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: tightness/dyspnea [P-1], upper airway [P-11], cough/chest pain denials [P-1,P-11,D-36]. However, the note fabricates absence of denials for fevers/night sweats/chills/weight loss/anxiety/sweating, which are explicitly present (P-6,P-12-P-15). Doctor summary [D-36] is verifiable but not patient denial. Multiple hallucinated absences.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address present symptoms (respiratory/upper airway/chest) and explicit denials of listed screened symptoms; no off-topic content despite errors."
