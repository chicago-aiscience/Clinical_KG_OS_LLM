  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly factually correct regarding the symptoms (dry cough, wheezing, shortness of breath) and triggers (cold, exercise, pollen). However, it contains a citation error: it attributes the confirmation of chest tightness to [P-4], but that symptom was confirmed in [P-20]. [P-4] refers to the type of inhaler used.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer and the prompt's specific requirements. It fails to mention the patient's current age (10) or the two-year history since diagnosis at age eight. Most importantly, it does not explicitly state the baseline usage frequency ('once every two weeks') or the specific current frequency ('5-6 times per week'), which were central to the question. It also omits the presence of nighttime symptoms and the fact that wheezing episodes occur more frequently than bronchodilator use.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is generally grounded in the transcript, but the citation [P-4] for chest tightness is a hallucination/error in referencing. The rest of the claims regarding triggers and symptoms are supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but lacks the level of detail requested in the prompt regarding the 'evolution' of usage. While it mentions an increase, it doesn't contrast the specific quantitative data provided in the transcript (1/2 weeks vs. 5-6/week) as effectively as the Gold Answer does. It includes irrelevant 'Knowledge Graph' terminology not found in the source or gold answer style guidelines provided in the prompt context but remains focused on the medical case at hand. It also includes the sister's asthma history, which is relevant context but wasn't explicitly asked for in the evolution of symptoms question. It does not address the nighttime symptoms at all, which is part of the current exacerbation's evolution mentioned in the transcript and gold answer."
