  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that wheezing 'initially began without a reported acute trigger [P-1]', contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript where the initial presentation was during physical activity (playing tag) [P-2, P-3]. It denies an explicit single nocturnal episode, despite clear evidence in [P-43, P-44], and inaccurately links past viral infections [P-15] to the current fluctuating pattern, which Gold attributes solely to the recent episodic symptoms [P-5, P-6]. Core symptoms like onset timing [P-1], wheezing [P-2], dyspnea [P-32], cough [P-1], and triggers [P-3, P-38] are mostly accurate, but significant contradictions exist.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: onset 4-5 days [P-1], wheezing and difficulty breathing [P-2], fluctuating/episodic pattern [P-5/P-6 implied], cough emergence [P-1], some triggers [P-3, P-38]. Missed or incomplete: initial trigger explicitly as playing tag for onset [P-3], detailed fluctuating resolution with rest and recurrence with activity [P-6], cough as non-productive [P-31], single nocturnal wheeziness and trouble falling asleep [P-43, P-44], pertinent negatives (no cyanosis [P-32], no fever [P-7], fine otherwise [P-9]). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: onset [P-1], symptoms [P-2, P-32], cough [P-1], triggers [P-3, P-38]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'without reported acute trigger [P-1]' (P-1 does not state this; trigger follows in P-3); 'transcript does not explicitly detail' nocturnal event (directly contradicted by [P-43, P-44]); past infections [P-15] misrepresented as current fluctuating history. Multiple inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures around symptom onset, progression, triggers, and patterns, addressing the question on development and changes. Minor tangents include past infections, allergies, and management [P-15, P-35, P-36], but core focus remains on respiratory symptoms timeline."
