  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies a specific potential exposure: hiking with their partner two weeks prior where other people “brushed by” them, implying close contact with strangers. The Generated Answer incorrectly states the patient “did not explicitly identify a specific exposure event,” which directly contradicts the transcript ([P-18], [P-19]). While the Generated Answer correctly notes key symptoms (anosmia/ageusia and dry cough) and that the clinician felt symptoms were consistent with COVID-19 ([D-39]), it is factually wrong on the central exposure-history point asked in the question.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed: (1) the specific exposure event—hiking with partner ~2 weeks prior and strangers brushing by; (2) the patient’s own statement that they couldn’t see where else they could have gotten it; (3) denial of known sick contacts; (4) contextual limited exposure due to online school/mostly staying home; (5) living with parents/sibling (with no reported household illness). The Generated Answer focuses mainly on symptoms and testing/self-isolation and omits most exposure-history details, which are the core of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not fully grounded in the transcript. It introduces “knowledge graph” links that are not present in the transcript and uses that to justify the COVID link. More importantly, it claims there was no explicit exposure event, which is disproven by the transcript ([P-18], [P-19]). Some content is grounded (symptoms and clinician wanting a test), but multiple elements are either unsupported or contradicted.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks for the potential exposure event and how that exposure connects to suspected COVID-19. The Generated Answer largely fails to identify the exposure event and instead pivots to symptom-based reasoning. Although symptom discussion is tangentially relevant, it does not directly answer the primary exposure-focused prompt."
