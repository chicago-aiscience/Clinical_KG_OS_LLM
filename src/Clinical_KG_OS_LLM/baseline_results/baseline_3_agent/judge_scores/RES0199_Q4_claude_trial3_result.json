  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab test as the diagnostic method, 24-48 hours as the turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. All facts align with the source transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main components requested: the condition to rule out, the diagnostic test with turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis. However, it omits several key details present in the Gold Answer, including: the 14-day isolation instruction, the public health contact tracing for positive results, and the supportive management approach. It covers approximately 60-70% of the key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The answer accurately cites the source and does not include any hallucinated information. The content is properly grounded in the source material with appropriate citation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question with focused, relevant information. It maintains a clear structure addressing each component (condition, test/timing, alternative diagnosis) without irrelevant tangents. The response is well-organized and perfectly aligned with the question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides accurate and relevant information that directly addresses the three-part question about the condition to rule out (COVID-19), the diagnostic test (swab with 24-48 hour turnaround), and alternative diagnosis (another viral illness). While factually correct and well-cited, it lacks several contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as isolation instructions, contact tracing protocols, and management approach, resulting in moderate completeness. The answer demonstrates strong correctness, faithfulness to the source, and relevance to the question."
