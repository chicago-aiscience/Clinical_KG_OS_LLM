  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly states cough began ~4–5 days before the visit and was not improving [P-2, P-4].\n- Correctly states runny nose started only in the past couple of days and discharge was clear [P-11, P-12].\n- Does not state the cough was dry/nonproductive or that it stayed the same, but it also does not contradict these facts.\n- Adds fever history, asthma family history/work-up, and planned CXR/COVID swab; these are accurate per transcript but not central to the asked symptom-development comparison.\nOverall: mostly accurate with minor omissions rather than errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered:\n- Timing/duration: cough 4–5 days; runny nose past couple days; runny nose started later.\n- Clear nasal discharge.\n\nKey Gold Answer elements missed:\n- Cough described as dry and non-productive throughout (no sputum/gunk).\n- Change in cough severity over time: stayed the same (neither worse nor better).\n- Explicit comparison to prior similar symptoms: never had a dry cough like this; prior runny noses did not last this long.\n- Relative timing inference (runny nose began ~2–3 days after cough) is not articulated.\n\nNet: captures some timeline basics but misses multiple required comparison/severity details.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript:\n- Cough duration and lack of improvement [P-2].\n- Runny nose timing and clear discharge [P-11, P-12].\n- Fever not checked/appeared not hot/no chills [P-13].\n- Family asthma history and no SOB/wheeze with activity [P-28].\n- Mention of possible chest X-ray and COVID swab [D-37, D-39].\nNo clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "- Addresses the timeline of cough vs runny nose, which is central to the question.\n- However, it does not answer several specific asked components (dry vs runny nose timing/duration details, change in cough severity, and comparison to prior similar episodes).\n- Includes tangential details (planned interventions, fever/asthma history) not requested.\nOverall: mostly on-topic but incomplete and with minor tangents."
