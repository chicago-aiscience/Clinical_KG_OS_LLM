  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three triggers (exercise [P-9], cold air/winter [P-11], pollen/spring [P-11]) and family history (sister's asthma [P-32]), matching Gold. It correctly notes increased bronchodilator use and symptoms for exacerbation, and links pollen to allergy suspicion. However, it introduces a 'knowledge graph' for linkages, which is absent from Gold and transcript, creating minor discrepancies; core facts remain consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers triggers (all three), family history (sister), exacerbation (symptoms, increased use), and allergy suspicion from pollen. Misses: no other triggers (P-10), clinician's specific responses (D-12 'allergies?', P-12 undiagnosed, D-13 'makes sense', D-31 revisit), family details (no other breathing problems P-33 or allergies P-34), precise rescue use frequency (every 2 weeks to 5-6x/week P-8), and clinician's medication suggestion (D-43). Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Citations (P-1, P-15, P-9, P-11, P-32) are accurate and verifiable. Symptoms, triggers, family history grounded in transcript. However, multiple references to 'knowledge graph' linking triggers/family to diagnoses/allergens are not in transcript, representing hallucinated external structure. Pollen as 'allergen' plausible but clinician inference only hinted.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how triggers, family history relate to exacerbation (via symptoms/use) and allergy suspicion (pollen), structured around question elements with no off-topic content."
