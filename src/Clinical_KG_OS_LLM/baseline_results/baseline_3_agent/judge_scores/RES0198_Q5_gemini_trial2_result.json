  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies COVID-19 as the 'infectious exposure source identified through the social history.' In clinical terms, an exposure source refers to the contact or environment (the nephew in daycare, as noted in the Gold Answer). Furthermore, the Generated Answer claims the doctor emphasized supportive care because of the patient's diabetes/immune function; however, the Gold Answer correctly notes that the transcript does not show the doctor making this link.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses the primary key point from the social history: the nephew who attends daycare. It also fails to mention that the transcript lack an explicit link between the chronic condition and the infection risk/management by the physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a causal link between the patient's diabetes and the doctor's recommendation for supportive care. The doctor [D-39] recommends supportive care as a general treatment for what they assess as a common cold, without mentioning the patient's diabetes as the reason.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the prompt in that it attempts to identify an exposure source and a chronic condition, but it fails to correctly interpret the 'social history' aspect of the question."
