  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it claims the transcript does not state whether symptoms are getting better, worse, or staying the same. However, the patient explicitly states 'I think it's staying the same' [P-2] and that it has been 'pretty steady' [P-3]. It also fails to accurately describe the change in the walking routine, implying it continues as normal instead of being reduced.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It does not explicitly state the patient was walking when symptoms first appeared. 2) It fails to provide the trend (staying the same). 3) It misses 'getting up out of a chair' as an exacerbating factor. 4) It misses the specific impact on the walking routine (reducing from two walks to one daily).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the transcript by claiming information is missing when it is clearly present (the trend of symptoms). Other parts, such as the description of tightness on inspiration, are accurately grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address all parts of the question but fails to provide the specific details requested for most of them, providing a generic summary rather than the precise answers found in the transcript."
