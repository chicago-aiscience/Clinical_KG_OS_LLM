  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several factual errors relative to the Gold Answer and the transcript. Most notably, it claims the transcript does not state a frequency for diarrhea, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions 'five or six times a day' [P-28]. It also fails to provide the numeric severity rating for the headache (7/10) and the specific nature of the cough (dry), both of which were requested and are present in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the majority of the specific details requested in the prompt. It fails to include the frequency of diarrhea episodes, the 'dry' nature of the cough, and the 1-10 severity rating of the headache. It only successfully identifies the number of vomiting episodes (two).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates an absence of information by stating the transcript does not explicitly state a frequency for diarrhea. This information is clearly present in turn [P-28]. Other details provided, like the onset dates, are grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "While the answer is structured to address the question's categories, it fails to provide the specific values explicitly requested in the prompt (frequency, nature, and rating), making it only partially relevant to the user's information needs. It provides vague descriptions ('pretty persistent') instead of the requested metrics ('7/10')."
