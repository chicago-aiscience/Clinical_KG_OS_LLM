  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the symptoms for general infectious process (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches) and additional symptoms for COVID concern (difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) exactly matching the Gold Answer and direct quotes from D-36 in the transcript. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: symptoms for general infection (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches) and additional distinct symptoms (difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) from D-36. Explanatory notes in Gold (e.g., taste/smell not cited, orders) are not core symptom requirements of the question, so 100% coverage of essentials.",

    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses the question by specifying the exact symptoms cited by the doctor in the assessment, with relevant quotes and no extraneous content."
