  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor's concluding remarks are not included in the transcript, directly contradicting the presence of [D-33] which explicitly states the plan to pass information to another doctor; it misses or inaccurately represents many key facts from Gold Answer such as full symptom details (e.g., 1.5 weeks duration, at rest/alone, distraction relief, not worse with exercise), numerous pertinent negatives (no trauma, fevers, asthma, etc.), living alone, and multivitamin only; introduces minor inaccuracies in anxiety symptoms (e.g., claiming shortness of breath when patient denies hard time breathing); significant contradictions on core plan and partial symptom coverage warrant score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers plan + 5 categories of key info (detailed symptoms, failed OTC, negatives, history, psychosocial); Generated covers partial symptoms (sharp, deep breath, 20min, OTC), smoking, family hx dad MI, teen anxiety, stress; misses plan entirely, 1.5wk duration, rest/alone/distraction/not exercise, most negatives (trauma/fevers/asthma/SOB/palps/fam sudden), living alone, multi; covers ~30% of key points, score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims concluding remarks absent (false, [D-33] exists); cites some accurately (e.g., [P-3],[P-6]); but hallucinates 'knowledge graph' and '[SYMPTOM] anxiety' not in transcript; misrepresents anxiety (claims SOB/rapid/heart flutter as symptoms, but transcript specifies no hard SOB, flutter only in past attacks, rapid from nervousness); multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses key clinical info gathered (second part of question) with structured list but ignores/denies first part (plan/concluding remarks) despite evidence; adds off-topic 'knowledge graph'; partially relevant due to focus on symptoms/history but incomplete and erroneous on plan, score 3."
