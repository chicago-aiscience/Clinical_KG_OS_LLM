  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies acute bronchitis as the diagnosis, which aligns with the core of the Gold Answer's 'most likely acute bronchitis,' but omits nuances like possible bacterial superinfection, early community-acquired pneumonia, and superposition on chronic cough; explanations for symptoms are directionally correct but less detailed (e.g., combines productive cough and sputum color without separating sputum's specific infectious implication, and simplifies fever's role); mentions of 'Knowledge Graph' are erroneous as they contradict the Gold Answer's basis in transcript alone, representing minor to some factual discrepancies while maintaining core consistency.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnosis of acute bronchitis (partial), productive cough [P-2, P-12], greenish sputum [P-9, D-47], subjective fever [P-4]; missed: chronic cough background (3-month history), specific transition to productive phase, sputum color's distinct role in suggesting bacterial etiology, doctor's summary distinguishing from serious conditions [D-47], absence of other constitutionals (night sweats, weight loss), and note on lack of vitals/exam; covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in transcript include productive cough [P-2, D-47, P-12], greenish sputum [P-9, D-47], subjective fever [P-4], tiredness/sleep issues [P-19-21]; however, multiple hallucinations: 'Knowledge Graph' references (explicitly establishing links) not present anywhere in transcript, falsely attributing evidence to non-existent source; plausible but unverifiable ties of tired/sleep to bronchitis via KG; several hallucinated elements undermine grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by naming diagnosis (acute bronchitis) and explaining contributions of the three features (productive cough + sputum combined, and fever separately); minor tangent with irrelevant 'Knowledge Graph' mentions, but overall focused on required elements without off-topic content."
