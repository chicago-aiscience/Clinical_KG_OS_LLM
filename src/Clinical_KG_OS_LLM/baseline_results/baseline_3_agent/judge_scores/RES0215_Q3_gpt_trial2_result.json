  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer’s main diagnosis (asthma, specifically exercise-induced and cold-triggered, with atopic/allergic background) matches the Gold Answer’s conclusion of pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and atopic predisposition. Supporting quotes for exercise trigger [P-3, P-41], cold worsening [P-38], multi-setting occurrence [P-38], and seasonal allergies/Reactine use [P-35, P-36] are accurate.\n\nHowever, it introduces non–Gold-supported framing and some potentially misleading emphasis: it references a “knowledge graph” (not part of the transcript) and highlights a remote “viral infection” history [P-15] as supportive, whereas the Gold Answer emphasizes current pertinent negatives arguing against infection (no fever/runny nose/sick contacts/phlegm). These issues do not overturn the main diagnosis but reduce factual alignment with the Gold rationale.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer support that IS covered: \n- Exercise-triggered symptoms [P-3, P-41]\n- Cold weather worsening [P-38]\n- Occurs across multiple settings [P-38]\n- Seasonal allergies/atopy and OTC antihistamine use [P-35, P-36]\n\nKey Gold Answer support that is MISSING/underemphasized:\n- Clear episodic/recurrent pattern with activity [P-6]\n- Spontaneous reversibility with rest (“when she rests then it goes away”) [P-6] and recovery on its own [P-33]\n- Nocturnal wheeze episode/trouble falling asleep [P-43, P-44]\n- Pertinent negatives against infection: no fever [P-7], no runny nose [P-8], no sick contacts [P-10], no phlegm [P-31]\n\nOverall, it captures several major triggers/atopy points but misses multiple important Gold-supporting features (reversibility, nocturnal symptom, infectious negatives).",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are directly supported with correct transcript citations (exercise, cold, multi-setting, allergies, wheeze/SOB descriptions). \n\nBut the answer includes content not grounded in the transcript: repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and associated claims (e.g., linking Reactine/wheezing relationships via that graph). Additionally, the statement that the “knowledge graph” notes viral infections cause wheezing is not transcript-grounded, and the transcript’s viral infections are historical and not clearly tied to the current presentation. These reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the question—naming the most likely respiratory diagnosis and citing supporting transcript findings (exercise, cold, multi-setting, allergies, wheeze/SOB). Minor irrelevance/tangent comes from “knowledge graph” mentions and the less-relevant viral-history discussion."
