{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fundamentally fails to answer the question. The question asks for symptoms the patient DENIED, yet the Generated Answer lists symptoms the patient REPORTED (shortness of breath, cough, fever) and an event the patient ADMITTED to (missing a Keppra dose). It incorrectly identifies these as the items screened and denied. It only identifies one actual denial (frequency of seizures), whereas the Gold Answer and transcript list many clinical screening denials.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention chest pain, feeling faint, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sick contacts, travel history, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, or sputum production—all of which were screened for and denied.",
    "faithfulness": "While the symptoms mentioned (SOB, cough, fever) are present in the transcript, the Generated Answer's logic is flawed as it categorizes them as denied or uses them to answer a prompt specifically about negative findings. It also suggests 'stroke risk' in the context of pulmonary embolism, which is medically confusing and not mentioned in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question. Instead of identifying negative findings and how they narrow the differential, it focuses on the positive findings and provides a general differential for those, ignoring the 'denied' aspect of the prompt entirely or reversing it."
