  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated, prompted by hospital work (P-34, P-17), flu-like symptoms (sore throat P-13, runny nose P-14, cough), persistent cough, coworkers scared (P-35), PPE/careful (P-17), with test negative two weeks prior (P-36) and patient staying home. Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19, test negative (P-35), persistent cough (P-2), initial flu-like (P-14), hospital work (P-17), coworkers scared (P-35). Minor discrepancy: Generated lists chest soreness (P-15/16) as prompting evidence, but this was not a primary prompter in Gold (patient reported no chest pain initially, soreness post-coughing, and test predated this discussion); core facts align without contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: COVID-19 investigated; patient disclosed test (P-35); prompts - hospital clerk (P-34/17), viral symptoms (sore throat/runny nose/cough P-13/14), persistent cough, coworkers scared (P-35), PPE/careful (P-17), test 2 weeks ago at onset (P-36), negative result, stayed home since (P-36). Generated covers: COVID-19, test disclosure/negative (P-35), persistent cough (P-2), initial flu-like (P-14), hospital work (P-17), coworkers scared (P-35), adds chest soreness. Missed: specific sore throat/runny nose, PPE/careful detail, exact test timing/staying home. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated verifiable in transcript: COVID test mentioned (P-35), persistent cough 2 weeks (P-2), chest soreness after coughing (P-15/16), initial flu-like symptoms resolving except cough (P-14), hospital work (P-17/P-34), coworkers scared (P-35). No hallucinations; inferences (e.g., urgency from work) grounded in context. Citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for diagnosis investigated, evidence prompting it, and testing results. Generated Answer is structured directly around these (Diagnosis, Evidence Prompting with bullets, Testing Results), with no off-topic content; perfectly addresses query."
