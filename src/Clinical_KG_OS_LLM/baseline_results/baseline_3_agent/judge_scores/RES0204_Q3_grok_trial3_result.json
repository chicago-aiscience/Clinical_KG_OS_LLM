  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the persistent cough (4-5 days, not improving) and clear runny nose as key presenting symptoms with accurate citations [P-2, P-11, P-12], and quotes the doctor's rationales for chest X-ray [D-37] and COVID swab [D-39] matching the Gold Answer. However, it omits the dry/non-productive nature of the cough [P-5, P-6], fails to detail the systematic documentation of multiple pertinent negatives (e.g., no fever/chills [P-13], sore throat [P-9], anosmia [P-10], chest pain [P-15], muscle pain [P-14]), no sick contacts [P-19, P-22], no travel [P-20], family history of asthma [P-28], and novelty of symptoms [P-24], which the Gold Answer uses to explain the combination leading to orders. It introduces extraneous 'knowledge graph' details not in Gold or transcript, creating minor discrepancies, but core facts on symptoms and doctor's stated reasons are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: persistent cough 4-5 days not improving, clear runny nose, doctor's quotes for X-ray and COVID swab rationales. Missed: explicit dry/non-productive cough, full list of pertinent negatives (fever/chills, sore throat, taste/smell, chest pain, muscle aches, headaches, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain), no sick contacts/travel, family asthma history, novelty/persistence despite absent high-acuity markers prompting X-ray, and COVID as protocol regardless of absent fever/anosmia. Covers ~30-40% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about symptoms and doctor's quotes [P-2, P-11, P-12, D-37, D-39] are directly verifiable in transcript. Reference to no severe distress/wheezing/SOB [P-28] is grounded but interpretive. However, 'knowledge graph' entities ([PROCEDURE] chest xray --[LOCATED_AT]--> chest/lungs; covid swab -- nose) are entirely fabricated/not in transcript, representing hallucinated content. Multiple unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around rationales for chest X-ray and COVID swab based on presenting symptoms, using transcript quotes, thus addressing the question's focus on how findings led to orders. Minor off-topic tangents via knowledge graph; does not deeply integrate absent findings but stays mostly on-topic."
