  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer regarding the primary diagnosis to rule out (COVID-19), the symptom combination (headache, cough, GI symptoms), and the characteristic symptom (loss of smell). It correctly cites the relevant sections of the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the main points but omits several details present in the gold answer: it misses 'fatigue' in the symptom list, does not specify that the cough was 'dry' or the headache 'persistent', and completely omits the section on pertinent negatives (no fever, no runny nose, etc.) and the mention of alternative viral illnesses.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and the provided citations are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly focused and directly addresses both parts of the user's question without unnecessary filler."
