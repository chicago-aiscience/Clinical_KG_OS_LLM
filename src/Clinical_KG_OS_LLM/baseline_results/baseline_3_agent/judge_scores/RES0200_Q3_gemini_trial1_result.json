  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three cardinal symptoms and the doctor's linking logic. However, it cites [P-1] for the COPD history ('a few years prior'), whereas the transcript [P-2] clarifies it was actually 'five years ago'. It also incorrectly references a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source of clinical reasoning, which is not part of the provided source material.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main symptoms and the doctor's summary in [D-52]. It misses the specific detail about the patient's current medications (Ventolin and Spiriva) which the Gold Answer includes as part of the 'established COPD' context, and it uses the initial timeline [P-1] rather than the clarified timeline [P-2].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' as a supporting document for the clinical reasoning. While the medical facts about COPD are plausible, the reference to an external Knowledge Graph is not grounded in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both the specific symptoms requested and the doctor's assessment logic."
