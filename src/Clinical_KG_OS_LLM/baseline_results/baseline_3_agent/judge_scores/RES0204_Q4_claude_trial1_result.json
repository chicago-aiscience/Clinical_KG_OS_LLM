  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the respiratory condition ruled out and accurately cites the family history in grandparents. It correctly identifies the key negative clinical findings (shortness of breath, wheezing) and the important detail about no symptoms even during physical activity. However, it omits the mother's statement that the patient had 'been worked up for that' (prior clinical evaluation), which is an important clinical finding mentioned in the Gold Answer. The core facts are accurate but slightly incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main key points: (1) asthma was ruled out, (2) positive family history in grandparents, (3) absence of shortness of breath and wheezing, and (4) no symptoms even during physical activity. However, it misses several details present in the Gold Answer: the specific exchange citations [D-28, P-28, D-30], the prior workup mentioned by the mother, the mother's definitive conclusion 'he doesn't have that', and the contextual information about the patient being 'pretty healthy otherwise' [P-24]. Covers approximately 70-75% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [P-28]. The citation is accurate, and no information is fabricated or hallucinated. The answer stays grounded in what the mother actually stated in the conversation. The formatting uses bullet points for clarity, which is a stylistic choice but doesn't add unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question: (1) what respiratory condition was ruled out (asthma), (2) the family history context (grandparents), and (3) the specific clinical findings including symptoms NOT present during physical activity. The response is focused and contains no irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the ruled-out condition and correctly cites the key negative clinical findings (no shortness of breath or wheezing, even during physical activity) mentioned by the mother. It is well-grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations and directly addresses the question. However, it lacks some completeness compared to the Gold Answer, omitting the prior workup mentioned by the mother and other contextual details. The core medical information is correct and relevant, earning strong scores in correctness, faithfulness, and relevance, with a moderate score in completeness."
