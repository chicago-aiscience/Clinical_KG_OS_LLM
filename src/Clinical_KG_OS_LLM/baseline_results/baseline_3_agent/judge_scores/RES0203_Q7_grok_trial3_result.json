  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that all three symptoms began simultaneously two days prior, matching Gold [P-1, P-2]; correctly notes no worsening or fluctuation with citation to cough consistency [P-8] and implies for sensory; accurately reports no prior history, consistent with Gold [P-3]. No factual errors or contradictions, though it does not detail partial sensory loss persistence [P-4] or specific cough timing confirmation [D-6, P-6], but these are not misstated.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: simultaneous onset of all three symptoms ~2 days prior [P-1]; no worsening/fluctuation (cites consistency for cough [P-8]); no prior similar symptoms. Missed or partially covered: specific confirmation cough started same time [D-6, P-6]; sensory symptoms consistency [D-5, P-5]; explicit non-intermittent nature; persistence of partial sensory loss [P-4]; doctor's COVID consistency note [D-39]. Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: simultaneous onset [P-1]; consistency of cough [P-8]; no prior symptoms (doctor asked [D-3], patient denied [P-3], even if not cited). Citations accurate [P-1, P-8]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; 'no evidence' phrasing for prior history is grounded as absence confirmed.",
    "relevance": "Answer is structured precisely around the question's elements—onset timing relative to each other (simultaneous), worsening/fluctuation (none), prior history (none)—with no off-topic content or tangents."
