  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details quality as initially 'uncomfortable/odd' evolving to 'very sharp, strong pain' specifically with deep breaths, duration as 20-min episodes intermittent over 1.5 weeks, occurrence when alone (walking to school, studying), resolution when socially engaged/at school, at rest, not worse with exercise, no prior episodes/injury. Generated captures sharp/strong quality partially but misses deep breath trigger and initial descriptors, correctly notes 20-min duration, but incorrectly attributes occurrence exclusively to anxiety attacks/stress with misquoted P-20 (which is about palpitations, not pain), conflates stress mentions without matching exact situations (alone vs. social), and wrongly states exclusivity/resolution tied to anxiety; misses onset, rest, exercise, etc. Significant contradictions on situations/cause and hallucinations reduce to score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1.5-week onset, quality (uncomfortable to sharp with deep breath), 20-min intermittent episodes, occurs alone/walking/studying/rest, resolves social engagement, not worse exercise, no injury/prior. Generated covers duration fully, partial quality (sharp/strong), partial occurrence (stress/thesis but wrong details), poor resolution (misattributes exclusivity), adds meds; misses onset, deep breath, exact situations, exercise/rest. Covers ~30-40% accurately, score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like sharp/strong [P-3,P-6] verifiable; duration [P-6] ok; stress/thesis [P-15,16] grounded; but P-20 misapplied (palpitations, not pain), P-19 stretched to pain trigger; 'exclusive to anxiety attacks' fabricated; 'localized in chest' vague (obvious from context); meds [P-6] ok. Multiple misattributions/hallucinations, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Structured directly around quality, duration, occurrence triggers, resolution; extras like meds minor tangent but question-focused overall, score 4."
