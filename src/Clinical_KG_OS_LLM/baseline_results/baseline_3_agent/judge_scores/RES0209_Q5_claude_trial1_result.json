  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) and the family history of asthma in the sister. It correctly notes the escalation in bronchodilator use and connects these factors to the current exacerbation. However, it incorrectly introduces 'knowledge graph' references that are not present in the source transcript, which represents a factual error in attribution.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) and family history but misses several key details from the Gold Answer: (1) the specific frequency of rescue inhaler use (once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week), (2) the doctor's specific response 'that would make sense' to the allergy suspicion, (3) the patient's denial of other allergies when asked, (4) the clinician's suggestion about medication changes, and (5) the rescue-only approach being insufficient. Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains significant unfaithfulness issues. It repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the transcript. While the core clinical facts (triggers, family history, symptoms) are grounded in the transcript, the framing device of a knowledge graph and claims about what it 'identifies' or 'classifies' are completely fabricated. This represents substantial hallucination despite the underlying clinical facts being accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by explaining how the three triggers and family history relate to the current exacerbation and suspected allergies. The structure follows the question's components systematically. However, the introduction of the non-existent knowledge graph framework adds some irrelevant content that distracts from the core clinical relationship being asked about."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key clinical elements (three triggers, family history, symptom exacerbation, allergy suspicion) but has significant issues with faithfulness due to repeated references to a non-existent 'knowledge graph.' It misses important details about symptom frequency, specific physician responses, and treatment implications. While the core clinical relationships are explained relevantly, the hallucinated knowledge graph framework undermines the answer's reliability. The response demonstrates adequate understanding but requires more faithful grounding in the actual transcript and greater completeness in covering key details."
