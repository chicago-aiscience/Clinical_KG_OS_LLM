  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: condoms for contraception [P-45] match, and no medications prescribed for current symptoms during the visit aligns with [P-29] and [D-47]. No factual errors or contradictions, though scope is narrow.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: no current medications [P-29], current moisturizing creams for eczema [P-23], past prescribed creams for eczema [P-23], no allergies [P-28], possible cat allergy no treatment [P-27], condoms [P-45], marijuana [P-36,P-37], alcohol [P-41,P-42], no OTC for cough. Generated covers condoms and no meds for symptoms (partial overlap with no current meds and no OTC), missing eczema history/treatment (current and past), allergies, substances; covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about condoms [P-45] and no prescription for symptoms [P-29, D-47] are directly verifiable in transcript. 'Knowledge graph provided' is not in transcript (minor hallucination). No other fabrications; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications/treatments and current status, focusing on contraception and lack of prescriptions for symptoms; no irrelevant content but incomplete coverage of broader question elements like past prescriptions and other treatments."
