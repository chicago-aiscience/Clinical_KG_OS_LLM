  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly links Jessica’s scratchy throat, dry non-productive cough, and headache to a likely URI and appropriately uses the lack of sputum to argue against a lower-respiratory process. However, it contains a factual error by stating that the patient did not explicitly report absence of GI symptoms or joint pain—she clearly denied nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and joint aches in [P-11], [P-12], and [P-13]. It also introduces “Knowledge Graph” mapping, which is not part of the Gold Answer or transcript, and slightly over-specifies “common cold” (while plausible, the Gold Answer stays at “typical URI”).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: scratchy throat, dry cough, headache, and no sputum (upper airway irritation vs productive lower respiratory process). Key points missed or only weakly addressed: 3–4 day timeline, subjective fever/persistent feeling hot day and night, malaise/fatigue, explicit absence of GI symptoms and joint pain as supportive negatives, household exposure (brother’s cold), and the doctor’s explicit summary framing [D-58]. Overall coverage is roughly around half to two-thirds of the Gold Answer content.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded in the transcript (dry cough/scratchy throat/headache; no phlegm). But the answer adds unverifiable content (“Knowledge Graph” mapping) and incorrectly claims the patient did not explicitly deny GI/joint symptoms, which contradicts the transcript. These issues reduce grounding and introduce hallucinated framing.",
    "relevance": "The response largely addresses how the symptom pattern and absence of sputum/GI/joint symptoms supports a URI assessment, which is the core of the question. Minor tangents (e.g., “Knowledge Graph,” “systemic pathogens” discussion) detract slightly but do not dominate."

  "summary": "The answer is generally on-topic and captures the non-productive URI pattern, but it misses several key supporting details from the Gold Answer and includes an ungrounded “Knowledge Graph” element plus a transcript-inconsistent claim about GI/joint symptom denial."
