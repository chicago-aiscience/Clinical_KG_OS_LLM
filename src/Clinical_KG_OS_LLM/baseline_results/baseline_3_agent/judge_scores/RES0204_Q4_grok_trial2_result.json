  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition ruled out, correctly attributes the family history to grandparents, and precisely lists the mother's cited symptoms (shortness of breath and wheezing absent even during physical activity) with accurate citation [P-28]. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: condition (asthma), family history in grandparents [P-28], specific symptoms not exhibited (shortness of breath, wheezing, even with physical activity) [P-28]. Missed: prior 'worked up' evaluation, doctor's questions/acknowledgment [D-28/D-30], mother's conclusion 'he doesn't have that', patient's overall health and lack of prior dry cough [P-24]. Covers core question elements (80-99%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: asthma and grandparents from [P-28], symptoms absent even with activity from [P-28], citation accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers the question by naming the condition, noting family history despite which it was ruled out, and listing exact mother-cited findings including absence even during physical activity. No off-topic content."
