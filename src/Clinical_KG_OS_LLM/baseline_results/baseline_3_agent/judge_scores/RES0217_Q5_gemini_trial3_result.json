  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the reasoning behind the 72-hour attachment duration using the patient's activities on Friday and Saturday. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain evidence of the doctor using an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map or the geographic position of Strathroy to justify treatment. In reality, segment [D-13] explicitly mentions the map and identifies Strathroy as a 'concerning point' to justify moving forward with antibiotics.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first part of the question (attachment duration) well. It fails to provide the reasoning for the second part (geographic justification) because it incorrectly claims the information is missing from the source text, thus missing approximately 50% of the key points found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant negative hallucination by claiming the transcript lacks specific information (the map and Strathroy's risk level) that is clearly present in segment [D-13]. This claim is a direct contradiction of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it attempts to address both parts of the specific multi-part question, although its conclusion for the second part is based on an incorrect assessment of the source text."
