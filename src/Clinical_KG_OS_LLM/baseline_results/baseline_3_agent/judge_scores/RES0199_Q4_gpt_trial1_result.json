  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all elements asked in the question: (1) the primary condition to rule out was COVID-19, (2) the ordered diagnostic test was a swab test with an expected turnaround time of 24–48 hours, and (3) if negative, the alternative diagnosis considered was another viral illness circulating at that time of year. No factual contradictions or additions are present.",
    "completeness": "For the question’s required elements, the Generated Answer includes all key points: condition to rule out (COVID-19), specific test (swab), turnaround time (24–48 hours), and alternative diagnosis if negative (another viral illness). It does not include additional counseling items from the Gold Answer (e.g., isolate 14 days, public health contact tracing, supportive care), but these are not necessary to answer the specific question as posed.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript at [D-52] (COVID to rule out, swab test, 24–48 hour results, alternative of another viral illness). No hallucinated details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what was asked (rule-out condition, test and turnaround time, alternative diagnosis if negative) with no tangential material."
