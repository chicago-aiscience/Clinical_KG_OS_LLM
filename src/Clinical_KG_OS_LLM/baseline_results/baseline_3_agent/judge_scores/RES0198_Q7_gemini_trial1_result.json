{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly concludes that the symptoms were intermittent ('on and off') based on the patient's opening statement [P-1]. However, the Gold Answer and the transcript show that when explicitly asked later [D-8], the patient clarified the symptoms were 'pretty constant for the past week' [P-8]. By ignoring the clarification in P-8, the Generated Answer provides an inaccurate assessment of the symptom pattern compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the onset time, the first symptom (stuffy), and the shift to the predominant symptom (runny). However, it fails to mention the influence of over-the-counter medications noted in the Gold Answer. More importantly, it fails to capture the nuance of the patient's conflicting reports regarding whether the symptoms were constant or intermittent, which is a key part of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is grounded in specific transcript parts (P-1 and P-3). However, by omitting the information in P-8 where the patient states the symptoms were constant, it creates a misleading narrative that contradicts the overall findings in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the chronology, the first symptom, the shift in predominance, and the frequency (constant vs. intermittent)."
