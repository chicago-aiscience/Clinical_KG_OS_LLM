  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All symptoms listed in the Generated Answer match the transcript and Gold Answer: increased cough, increased green-yellow sputum, small hemoptysis with hard coughing, worsened dyspnea, subjective feverishness/hot feeling, and sinus pressure. It also correctly identifies cough as the most bothersome symptom. No incorrect symptoms are added.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: increased cough, green-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, worsened dyspnea, subjective fever, sinus pressure, and cough as most bothersome. Missed from Gold Answer: reduced exercise tolerance/functional limitation (walking dog becoming trickier) and mild headache. Gold Answer also lists many pertinent negatives, which were not included (not strictly required by the question, but they are part of the Gold Answer content). Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript, and the bracketed citations correspond to the correct sections. No apparent hallucinations or unsupported inferences beyond what the patient stated.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked items: respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms during the 3-day worsening, and the most bothersome symptom. No meaningful irrelevant content."
