  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the clinician assessed for erythema migrans (“bullseye rash”) and that it was not present, and it correctly lists the proposed evaluations: physical exam, tick identification at a lab, and blood work/serology (“titres or any serology”). Minor issues: it treats serology as referenced at [D-6] (the transcript’s serology mention is at [D-18]), and it relies on an “implies absent” phrasing rather than explicitly reflecting the patient’s denial at [P-6]. Overall facts align with the Gold Answer with only minor citation/precision problems.",
    "completeness": "Key absent clinical features in the Gold Answer include: no erythema migrans (covered), no joint pain (missed), no fever/systemic illness (missed), no headaches (missed), and generally feeling well (missed). Also missed: no other bites found and the plan to consult a supervising physician. Proposed tests: physical exam, tick lab identification, and Lyme serology (all covered). Overall, it captures the testing plan well but only 1 of several screened/absent clinical features.",
    "faithfulness": "The response stays within what is supported by the transcript regarding rash screening and the proposed tests. The main faithfulness issue is incorrect citation placement for serology (cited [D-6] though stated at [D-18]) and the absence of explicit anchoring to the patient’s denial [P-6]. No clear hallucinated clinical findings are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question (absent clinical features assessed; diagnostic tests proposed) without extraneous tangents, though it omits several assessed features that were asked about in the visit."
