  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's summary in [D-47] including cough duration ('for some time' aligns with 'for a little while'), recent worsening ('severe in last three days' matches 'only become bad in the last three days'), nighttime awakening, greenish sputum, and absence of constitutional symptoms. Plan to review story with doctors matches exactly. Information guiding next steps (patient's story/history) is correct. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'some time' vs. approximate 3 months, no explicit 'no blood' but implied) but no factual errors or contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: doctor's plan (review story), summary assessment (cough history, worsening, sputum, no constitutional symptoms), guiding info (patient's story). Missed: explicit ~3-month duration, 'no blood', patient-doctor exchange [P-47/D-48], no tests ordered, inference of supervising physician and lowered concern for serious illness. Covers core ~85% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from [D-47]: review story with doctors, cough summary, greenish sputum, no constitutional symptoms. 'Severe' is synonymous with 'bad'; 'general (constitutional)' matches transcript phrasing. No unverifiable or hallucinated content; fully grounded with accurate citation.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the three-part question with bullet points for plan, assessment, and guiding info. No tangents or off-topic content."
