  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the initial symptoms (headache and cough 4 days ago) matching Gold [P-1]. Loss of smell timing (1 day ago, ~3 days after initial) is accurate [P-24]. GI symptoms referenced as 'few days back' [P-1] with details on vomiting yesterday and nausea today [P-32] align broadly, but lacks Gold's precise diarrhea onset 2 days ago [P-28]. Headache described as persistent [P-3] but Gold specifies stable severity ('stayed around the same') [P-9], a minor discrepancy. Cough stability correct [P-11]. Listing smell before GI slightly misorders timeline (GI earlier). Core facts correct, minor discrepancies: score 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: initial H+C 4 days (covered); H details (persistent/bilateral/7/10/stable/atypical) - partial (persistent only); cough dry/stable (stable covered, dry missed); diarrhea precisely 2 days ago (missed, vague 'few days'); N/V details (covered); anosmia 1 day latest (covered); negatives (missed). Covers first symptoms, smell/GI relative to initial broadly, cough stability, partial H stability (~70% coverage): score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly grounded in cited transcript sections: [P-1] initial symptoms, [P-24] smell, [P-32] N/V timing, [P-11] cough, [P-3] headache persistent. Timing interpretation ('three days after') verifiable from context (4 days initial, 1 day smell). No hallucinations or inaccurate citations: score 5.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response as timeline addressing question's specifics: first symptoms, GI/smell relative timings, H/cough severity changes/stability. No off-topic content, fully focused despite gaps: score 5."
