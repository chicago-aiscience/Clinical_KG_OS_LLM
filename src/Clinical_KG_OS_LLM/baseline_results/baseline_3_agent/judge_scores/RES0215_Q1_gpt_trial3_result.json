  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the respiratory symptoms the mother mentioned: wheeze ([P-1],[P-2]), difficulty taking deep breaths ([P-2]), shortness of breath/out of breath with activity ([P-1],[P-3]), and a slight cough ([P-1]). However, it is incorrect about which symptoms were earliest at onset. When specifically asked what was noticed first ([D-2]), the mother states wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths ([P-2]). The generated answer incorrectly concludes that wheeze, cough, and shortness of breath were all present since the start; this conflicts with the mother’s phrasing “and now she has a slight cough” ([P-1]) and ignores the explicit onset clarification in [P-2].",
    "completeness": "It covers most key symptoms at presentation (wheeze, SOB/out of breath, cough) and includes the onset symptom of difficulty taking deep breaths. But it fails to correctly specify the earliest symptoms (wheeze + difficulty deep breaths) and misses some symptom characterization present in the gold answer (e.g., hard time catching breath during episodes, no cyanosis, non-productive cough). Given the question focus, the main completeness gap is the incorrect/missed onset detail.",
    "faithfulness": "Most symptom claims are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references. The main ungrounded/incorrect inference is that cough and shortness of breath were present since onset; the transcript instead explicitly identifies wheeze and difficulty taking deep breaths as first noticed ([P-2]) and implies cough developed later (“now…slight cough” [P-1]).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on respiratory symptoms and on timing/earliest symptoms, directly addressing the question with minimal extraneous content."
