  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Matches the Gold Answer on the main facts: patient used Tylenol at home for headache relief (supported by P-3/P-4), and the clinician recommended supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep), Tylenol for fever if it develops, and Tylenol or NSAIDs for myalgias/arthralgias, plus COVID swab and 14-day isolation (all in D-52). Minor inaccuracy: it paraphrases “NSAIDs” as “anseads (analgesics),” which is not as precise as the Gold Answer’s NSAIDs and could be interpreted incorrectly.",
    "completeness": "Includes nearly all key Gold Answer elements: (1) Tylenol already taken, (2) symptom targeted = headache, (3) supportive measures—hydration, nutritious food, sleep, (4) antipyretics (Tylenol) for fever, (5) Tylenol or NSAIDs for muscle/joint pains, (6) COVID swab and (7) isolate 14 days. It omits the Gold Answer detail that the patient had already been trying to keep hydrated before the visit (P-30) and does not explicitly note that no prescription medications were ordered.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate turn references. However, the mention of a “knowledge graph” linking Tylenol to headache is not present in the transcript and is therefore an ungrounded addition. Also, interpreting “anseads” as “analgesics” is not explicitly stated in the transcript (the clinician said NSAIDs). These are minor but real departures from strict grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question: identifies the home medication and target symptom, and lists the recommended medications and supportive measures from the management plan. Minimal extraneous content aside from the brief ‘knowledge graph’ mention."

  "summary": "The generated answer is largely accurate, complete, and relevant, with minor issues in grounding (knowledge-graph mention) and precision around NSAIDs/“analgesics,” and it omits a small pre-visit hydration detail noted in the Gold Answer."
