{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly sequences the sore throat. According to the transcript [P-1] and Gold Answer, the sore throat and stuffy nose occurred 'just before' the fever. The Generated Answer places the sore throat as developing 'subsequently' after the fever. Most other facts, including the stuffy nose as the first symptom and the husband's one-week duration, are correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the primary symptoms (stuffy nose, fever, sore throat, muscle aches) and the husband's timeline. However, it misses the specific calculation provided in the Gold Answer (husband starting 4 days before the patient's fever) and the doctor's conclusion regarding household transmission as part of the clinical progression context.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the sore throat developed after the fever is not supported by the transcript; the patient explicitly groups the sore throat with the stuffy nose as occurring 'just before' the fever. Other details are well-grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the chronological progression of the patient's symptoms and the comparison to her husband's timeline without irrelevant information."
