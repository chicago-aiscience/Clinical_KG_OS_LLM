  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer’s main diagnosis of acute bronchitis is compatible with the Gold Answer’s leading possibility (“acute bronchitis with possible bacterial superinfection or early community-acquired pneumonia”), but it is overly definitive and does not acknowledge the Gold Answer’s broader framing (acute LRTI with possible early pneumonia). It also introduces “Knowledge Graph” assertions not present in the Gold Answer and not required for the clinical reasoning, which detracts from factual alignment.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: productive cough with greenish sputum and subjective nighttime fever as supporting an acute infectious/inflammatory respiratory process.\nKey points missed: (1) the broader differential/phrasing (acute lower respiratory tract infection, with possible early CAP), (2) explicit integration of the chronic 3‑month cough with acute 3‑day worsening, (3) the nuance that green sputum is not definitive for bacterial infection, (4) fever as systemic inflammatory response with the caveat it was not measured, (5) mention that absence of night sweats/weight loss/hemoptysis helps distinguish from chronic serious causes, and (6) lack of vitals/exam/imaging/labs preventing confirmation.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript (e.g., references to a “Knowledge Graph” explicitly establishing symptom-diagnosis relationships; linking tiredness/sleep disturbance to acute bronchitis as a formal relationship). While it correctly quotes/reflects the patient’s report of green sputum and feeling hot at night, the added “Knowledge Graph” framing is essentially hallucinated with respect to the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked diagnosis and attempts to explain how cough/sputum/fever support it. However, it incompletely addresses the requested breakdown (it does not clearly separate how sputum color contributes independently from “productive cough,” and it lacks key clinical nuance requested/contained in the Gold Answer)."
