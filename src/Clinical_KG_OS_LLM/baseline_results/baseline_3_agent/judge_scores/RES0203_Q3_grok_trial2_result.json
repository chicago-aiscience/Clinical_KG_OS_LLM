  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough) matching Gold; correctly quotes doctor's connection from D-39; specifies swab test as in transcript and Gold; no factual errors or contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: three symptoms (100%), doctor's connection via D-39 (yes), swab test (yes), self-isolation (yes). Misses: patient's initial COVID worry (P-1), systematic confirmation of absent symptoms (fever P-10, etc., D-16), narrow profile supporting decision (~20-30% missed). Covers ~80% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptom claims verifiable in P-1, P-4, P-6-7; doctor's quote and swab/self-isolate exact from D-39; citations accurate. Minor unverifiable: 'nasopharyngeal swab' (transcript says 'swab' only, plausible but not explicit); 'knowledge graph provided' not in input but doesn't fabricate transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question: lists exact symptom combination, explains doctor's connection (quote), details test method (swab) and rationale; structured response with no off-topic content."
