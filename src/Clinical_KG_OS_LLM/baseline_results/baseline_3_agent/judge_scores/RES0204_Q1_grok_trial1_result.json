  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has a significant factual error by stating that the transcript 'does not explicitly specify whether the cough is productive or non-productive,' directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript where the doctor describes it as a 'dry cough' confirmed by the patient [D-5, P-5], and explicitly non-productive with no 'gunk' [D-6, P-6]. Cough duration matches (4-5 days), runny nose details match (couple days, clear), and wheezing/SOB absence aligns, but the core cough characteristic mismatch leads to low correctness.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: cough 4-5 days, runny nose couple days and clear appearance. Missed: cough explicitly dry/non-productive, stayed the same severity, never had dry cough before/past runny noses shorter, pertinent negatives like sore throat and chest pain. Covers approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: cough duration [P-2/P-4], runny nose [P-11/P-12], wheezing/SOB [P-28]. However, falsely claims transcript does not specify cough nature, hallucinating absence of explicit 'dry/non-productive' details present in [D-5/P-5/D-6/P-6]; this is a significant misreading with plausible but incorrect additions.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around respiratory symptoms (cough, runny nose) with characteristics, addressing the question's focus on symptoms, cough nature, and nasal discharge appearance; inclusion of wheezing/SOB absence is a minor relevant tangent as a pertinent negative."
