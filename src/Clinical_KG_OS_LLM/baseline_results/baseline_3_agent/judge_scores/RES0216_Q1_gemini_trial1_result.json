{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by claiming the transcript does not contain denials for fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, or sweating. These symptoms were explicitly denied by the patient in turns P-6, P-12, P-13, P-14, and P-15. While the reported symptoms section is mostly accurate, this major contradiction regarding the pertinent negatives makes the answer unreliable.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the majority of the 'explicitly denied' symptoms requested in the prompt. It only lists cough and chest pain, missing six other categories (fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, sweating) that were clearly present in both the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a form of hallucination by asserting that specific information is missing from the source text when it is actually present. It claims the transcript lacks the denials which are located in turns P-6 through P-15.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer follows the requested structure and addresses the reported symptoms well. However, it fails significantly on the second half of the prompt's specific requirement to list denied symptoms, incorrectly dismissing them as unmentioned."
