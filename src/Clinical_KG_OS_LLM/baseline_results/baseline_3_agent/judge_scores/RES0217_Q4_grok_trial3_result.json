  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the bullseye rash (erythema migrans) as a clinical feature assessed and absent [D-6, P-6], matching the Gold Answer. It correctly notes localized redness and tenderness are present but distinguishes from the bullseye rash. For diagnostic tests, it lists tick species identification [D-6, D-18], blood work/serology [D-18], and physical exam [D-18], which align with Gold. Minor issues: citation of D-6 for serology (actually D-18), omission of other features/tests does not introduce errors, and facts stated are fully consistent with transcript and Gold—no contradictions or inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: Clinical features absent—bullseye rash, joint pain [D-7/P-7], fever/illness [D-8/P-8], headaches [D-19/P-19-20], feeling well [D-18/P-18], no other bites [P-9] (6 points). Tests—physical exam of bite site, tick lab ID [P-1/D-5-6/18], serology [D-18], physician consult [D-13/22] (4 points). Covered: bullseye rash, tick ID, serology, physical exam (4/10 key points, ~40%). Missed: joint pain, fever, headaches, feeling well, no other bites, physician consult, bite site specificity.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in transcript: bullseye rash inquiry/denial [D-6/P-6], local symptoms [P-1/P-6], tick ID [D-5/D-6/D-18/P-1], serology [D-18], physical exam [D-18]. Minor citation inaccuracy (D-6 for serology, present in D-18), but no hallucinations or unverifiable details—fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around the question's two parts (clinical features absent and diagnostic tests proposed), with no off-topic content, perfectly focused."
