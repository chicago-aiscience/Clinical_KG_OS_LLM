{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it claims the transcript lacks explicit denials for cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, and chest pain. However, the transcript shows the patient explicitly denied these in P-15, P-16, P-23, P-17, and P-18. It correctly identifies the sore throat, swallowing issues, and taste issues, but misses others.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key reported symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, most notably difficulty breathing (a major part of the clinical presentation) and muscle aches/fatigue. It also misses nearly all the denied symptoms requested by the prompt, only identifying one (loss of smell) out of the six specific examples provided.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails faithfulness by hallucinating that information is absent from the source. It explicitly states that the transcript contains no statements denying several symptoms, when those denials are clearly present in the provided text. This is a hallucination of absence.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly attempting to answer both parts of the prompt (reported symptoms vs. denied symptoms), even though the content provided is largely incorrect or incomplete."
