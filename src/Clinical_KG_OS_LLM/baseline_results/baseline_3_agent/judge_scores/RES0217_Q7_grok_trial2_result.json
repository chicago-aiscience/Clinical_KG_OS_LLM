  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline (hiking Friday [P-1], gardening Saturday [P-1], >72 hours attachment [D-6], discovery behind left knee with container [P-1]) and comparison (prior bullseye rash/antibiotics/quite swollen [P-3]; current red/tender/no rash/smaller tick/not as engorged [P-3,P-4,P-6]), matching Gold's key facts. Minor discrepancies include extraneous [KG] citation (not in transcript), 'manageable' not verbatim from P-1, and slight rephrasing of patient's comparison (symptoms vs. tick appearance), but no major errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key timeline points: Friday hiking, Saturday gardening, >72h estimate, discovery location, container. Covers comparison: prior rash/antibiotics/swollen tick, current localized red/tender/no rash/less engorged/small tick. Misses minor Gold details like patient's uncertainty/hope it was from hiking not garden [P-1], 'earlier today' discovery timing, soreness prompting inspection [P-1], knee crease specificity [P-1,D-1], doctor's 'little grape' confirmation [D-4]. Approximately 85-90% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims directly verifiable: activities/timing [P-1,D-6], symptoms/location [P-1,P-6], prior history/comparison [P-3,P-4]. Minor issues: [KG] citation fabricated (no such reference), 'manageable' not in P-1 (inferred but not grounded), interpretive phrasing like 'did not look like the past one (referring to rash)' slightly stretches P-3. Doctor's input integrated accurately. Largely grounded with minor unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response into Timeline and Comparison sections directly addressing the question's two parts (exposure timeline from Friday hike/garden to discovery/presentation; symptom/engorgement comparison to prior ~10y bite with rash/antibiotics), with no off-topic content."
