  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the general idea that school attendance was considered a possible source (mother wondered he could have gotten COVID “at school or something” [P-2]) and that the school had not contacted them about exposures ([P-39]). However, it contains notable inaccuracies: (1) it states symptoms began Thursday; transcript says he developed cough Wednesday night after coming home from school [P-1]. (2) It asserts the timeline “suggests that the child contracted the illness during his time at school,” which overstates what was said; the mother only raised it as a concern/possibility [P-2]. (3) It says the mother did not report known sick contacts “at school or outside of school,” but she specifically said there were no known sick contacts outside school and that school was “kinda hard to say” [P-38], which is different from “no known contacts at school.”",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: school considered as potential source; no known sick contacts outside school; school did not notify them of exposures. Key points missed: the explicit outside-vs-school nuance (“we know for sure” not outside school, but uncertain at school) [P-38]; the school’s requirement for a COVID test to return and rationale about notifying others if there was an exposure [P-41]; additional narrowing context (no travel [P-40], no home environmental exposures [P-37]) included in Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not well-grounded: it speculates that the child likely contracted illness at school (not stated as fact in the transcript), introduces “knowledge graph” content that is not in the transcript, and uses inaccurate citations (e.g., school notification is supported by [P-39], not [P-1]).",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on school attendance, sick contacts, and school notification, which directly addresses the question. Minor irrelevant/unsupported additions (e.g., “knowledge graph,” asthma mention) reduce focus slightly."
