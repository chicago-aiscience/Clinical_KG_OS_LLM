  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major factual elements from the Gold Answer. The COVID swab, 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation (including from sister), false negative possibility, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and all specific warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms/seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting) are correctly stated and match the Gold Answer's content.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: diagnostic test ordered, turnaround time, isolation period (including separation from sister), false negative acknowledgment, alternative diagnosis if negative, and comprehensive warning signs with examples. The only minor omission is the Gold Answer's note about asthma being considered if presentation were different (only cough/SOB without fever), and the explicit mention of 'watchful waiting' and 'no medications prescribed,' but these are supplementary contextual details rather than core elements of the primary question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations to [D-44] and [D-45]. The doctor explicitly states the COVID swab requirement, 24-48 hour timeline, 14-day isolation including from sister, false negative possibility, alternative viral illness consideration, and all warning signs (high temperature, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells). No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the multi-part question: diagnostic test and turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negative possibility, and warning signs with examples. The response is well-organized with clear headings matching each question component, with no irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a highly accurate, well-structured response that addresses all major components of the complex multi-part question. It correctly identifies the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation including from sister, false negative acknowledgment, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and comprehensive warning signs. All claims are faithfully grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The only minor gap is omission of supplementary contextual details about the asthma differential and watchful waiting approach mentioned in the Gold Answer, preventing a perfect completeness score."
