  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the day-by-day progression: cough starting Wednesday evening as 'little dry cough' [P-1], persisting and worsening slightly on Thursday with tiredness [P-1], and further worsening on Friday with new fever over 100°F [P-1, P-2]. It correctly notes fatigue emerging Thursday ('really tired' [P-1]) and continuing Friday, decreased appetite Friday [P-15, P-17]. Minor discrepancies include not emphasizing Thursday's cough worsening as explicitly as Gold ('seemed to get a little bit worse'), presenting mother's speculative breathing difficulty [P-8] as a possible symptom, and omitting runny nose [P-16], mother's summary [P-12], and 3-day correction [P-4]; however, core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: Wednesday evening cough onset after fine at school [P-1]; Thursday cough persistence/worsening and tiredness [P-1]; Friday cough worsening, first-time fever details [P-1, P-2], decreased appetite/loss of taste suspicion [P-15, P-17], ongoing fatigue. Missed: mild runny nose [P-16], explicit mother's stepwise summary [P-12], 3-day duration correction [P-4], specific temp values (100.1/101), significant fatigue citation [P-25]. Covers ~85-90% of key symptom evolution points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims verifiable: day-by-day symptoms directly from [P-1]; fever [P-1, P-2]; appetite [P-15]; taste [P-17]; fatigue/activity [P-1, P-8, P-25 implied]. Mother's 'maybe harder breathing' [P-8] is speculative but quoted accurately; doctor inquiries [D-13] and recommendations [D-44] are in transcript but not hallucinated. No major fabrications, citations precise, minor interpretive stretch on breathing as symptom.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured day-by-day addressing cough onset (Wed night), severity progression (mild Wed, bit Thu, worse Fri), fever/new symptoms timing (fatigue Thu/Fri, appetite Fri). Minor off-topic tangents: doctor's chest pain inquiry [D-13] and COVID recs [D-44] not relevant to symptom evolution."
