  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the progression of symptoms across the three days. Wednesday evening: dry cough began. Thursday: cough persisted with fatigue. Friday: worsening cough, fever emergence (over 100°F), decreased appetite, suspected loss of taste, and continued fatigue. These facts align with the Gold Answer. Minor discrepancy: the Generated Answer mentions 'perhaps struggling slightly with breathing' which the mother clarified was uncertain due to the child being tired [P-8], while Gold Answer doesn't emphasize this ambiguity.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: (1) Wednesday evening - dry cough onset after appearing fine, (2) Thursday - persistent/worsening cough and fatigue, (3) Friday - further worsening cough, fever emergence with specific temperature (>100°F), decreased appetite, suspected loss of taste, fatigue, and mild runny nose. The Generated Answer includes the runny nose detail mentioned in Gold Answer [P-16]. It also references the mother's clarification about the timeline being three days [P-4] implicitly. The stepwise progression summary from [P-12] is captured in the day-by-day format.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. Wednesday evening dry cough [P-1], Thursday fatigue [P-1], Friday worsening cough [P-1], fever over 100°F [P-1], decreased appetite [P-15], suspected loss of taste [P-17], and runny nose detail. The Generated Answer appropriately cites the breathing uncertainty [P-8] though could be clearer about the mother's ambiguity. No hallucinated content detected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's requirements: day-by-day evolution from Wednesday through Friday, when cough appeared, how severity changed, and when fever and other symptoms emerged. The structure perfectly mirrors the question's format. The additional context about COVID testing recommendations [D-44] is marginally relevant but doesn't detract significantly from the core answer."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent response that accurately and completely addresses the question. It correctly details the day-by-day progression: Wednesday evening onset of dry cough, Thursday continuation with fatigue, and Friday worsening with fever emergence and additional symptoms. All facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and faithfully grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. The chronological structure directly answers the specific question about symptom evolution and timing."
