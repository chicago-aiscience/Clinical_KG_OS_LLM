  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several significant factual errors. It incorrectly states the pain is 'consistently localized in the chest' and 'feels the same each time' by citing [P-1] which doesn't support this. Most critically, it fundamentally mischaracterizes the triggers - claiming pain occurs 'only if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack' [P-20], when the transcript clearly shows the patient experiences pain while sitting/studying and walking alone, but it RESOLVES when engaged with others. The Generated Answer reverses the occurrence/resolution pattern from the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 40-50% of key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: sharp pain quality, 20-minute episodes, and deep breath trigger. However, it completely omits or misrepresents: the 'uncomfortable/odd' initial description, intermittent 'here and there' nature, occurrence during walking to school and studying alone, resolution when talking to people/doing activities, occurrence at rest, no worsening with exercise, no prior occurrence, and no preceding injury.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple claims not supported by or contradicting the transcript. It fabricates that pain occurs 'only if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack' - P-20 actually says the heart flutter feeling (not the chest pain) felt like that during anxiety attacks. It incorrectly attributes pain to 'workload and academic pressure' as direct triggers, when the patient actually says they notice it when alone/studying but NOT during engaged activities. The characterization of triggers versus resolution situations is inverted from what the transcript supports.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question about pain characteristics but focuses heavily on stress/anxiety aspects that, while mentioned in consultation, misrepresent the actual occurrence patterns. It provides less detail on the specific situations of occurrence versus resolution that the question asks about. The response is somewhat relevant but emphasizes wrong aspects and misses key situational details requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and misrepresentations of the patient's chest pain characteristics. Most critically, it reverses the occurrence/resolution pattern - incorrectly stating pain occurs during anxiety attacks when the transcript shows it occurs when alone (walking, studying) and resolves during social engagement. It omits many key details including the initial 'uncomfortable/odd' description, intermittent nature, specific triggering situations, and resolution patterns. The answer shows only partial completeness (40-50% of key points) and contains multiple unfaithful claims not supported by the transcript, including fabricated direct attribution to anxiety attacks as triggers."
