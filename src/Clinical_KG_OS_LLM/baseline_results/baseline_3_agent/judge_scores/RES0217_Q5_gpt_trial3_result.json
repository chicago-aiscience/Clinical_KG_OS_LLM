  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is partly correct on the attachment-duration calculation: it accurately reflects that the patient was hiking Friday and gardening Saturday (P-1) and that the doctor explicitly inferred this could mean the tick had been attached “longer than at least 72 hours” (D-6), supporting prophylaxis.\n\nHowever, it is factually incorrect in the second half: it claims the transcript does not show the doctor using an Ontario Lyme distribution map or Strathroy’s location to justify treatment. In fact, the doctor explicitly references “a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario” and states “Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point,” and therefore they will move forward with antibiotics (D-13). This is a major contradiction of the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer:\n- Hiking Friday + gardening Saturday with uncertain attachment timing (P-1): COVERED.\n- Tick noticed/removed “earlier today” (D-1): NOT INCLUDED.\n- Doctor’s inference that time outdoors Friday/Saturday implies >72 hours (D-6): COVERED.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics recommended based on duration (D-6): COVERED.\n- Strathroy along the creek exposure location (P-12): MENTIONED.\n- Doctor used Ontario Lyme map; Strathroy “close enough…concerning point” (D-13): MISSED/CONTRADICTED.\n- Conclusion to move forward with antibiotics due to geographic concern (D-13): MISSED/CONTRADICTED.\n\nOverall, it captures the duration rationale but omits and incorrectly negates the geographic-map justification, which is a major part of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded (P-1, D-6, P-12). But the answer contains a clear unfaithful claim: it asserts there is no evidence of map-based reasoning, despite explicit transcript content (D-13). It also introduces framing like “knowledge graph,” and adds emphasis on symptoms and gardening exposure as justification beyond what the question asks; those are present in the transcript but are not the key justification requested. The main faithfulness issue is the contradiction regarding the map.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the two elements asked (attachment duration and geographic justification). However, it adds secondary points (tick habitat, symptom tenderness) that are not central to the question, and more importantly it fails to answer the geographic/map part correctly. Still, it remains mostly on-topic."
