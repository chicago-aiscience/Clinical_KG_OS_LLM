  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core symptom course: a cough lasting two weeks [P-2], initially productive with whitish/clear mucus for ~4–5 days [P-6], then becoming a dry cough thereafter [P-6]. It also mentions chest discomfort with coughing; however, it labels this as “chest pain” rather than the transcript’s emphasis on soreness/ache only after coughing too much and denial of chest pain otherwise [P-15, P-16]. This is a minor nuance issue rather than a major contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Major omissions compared with the Gold Answer: (1) resolved sore throat (first 2–3 days) [P-13]; (2) resolved runny nose/“flu symptoms” in first few days and that everything except cough resolved by ~3–4 days [P-14]; (3) current cough characteristics—frequency (~3–4 times/hour) [P-9], spontaneous/no triggers [P-10], stable intensity [P-7] and not more frequent [P-8]; (4) pertinent negatives: no dyspnea [P-11], no fever [P-12], no N/V [P-19], no abdominal pain [P-20]. The answer captures only a subset (cough duration/type change and chest discomfort), well under 50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are grounded in the transcript (duration of cough [P-2], initial mucus then dry cough [P-6], chest discomfort with coughing [P-15]). The only concern is slight overstatement/word choice (“chest pain”) versus “hurts a little bit”/soreness after coughing [P-15, P-16], but it is still broadly supported and not fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic (symptoms during the illness, resolved vs ongoing). However, because it omits several explicitly reported symptoms and key current descriptors, it only partially fulfills the question’s intent even though what is included is relevant."
