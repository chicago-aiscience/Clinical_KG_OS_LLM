  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not indicate any systemic symptoms, whereas the patient specifically endorsed feeling 'chilly' [P-29]. It also fails to correctly identify the denied symptoms requested in the prompt's examples (orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer missed several key points from the Gold Answer: it omitted chest discomfort and chills as endorsed symptoms. Most significantly, it failed to list the specific 'commonly screened symptoms' requested in the question's prompt (orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations, fever), providing a different, less relevant list instead.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that there were no systemic symptoms endorsed is unfaithful to the transcript, as the patient endorsed 'feeling a bit chilly' in [P-29]. The rest of the information regarding respiratory symptoms and sputum character is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the general categories of the question but fails to address the specific examples provided in the prompt's parenthetical (orthopnea, PND, etc.), which are standard clinical negatives for this presentation."
