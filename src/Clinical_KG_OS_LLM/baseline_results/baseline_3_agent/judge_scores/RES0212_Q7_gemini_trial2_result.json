{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error regarding the sleep disruption timeline. It states that nightly waking began in the last three days, citing the doctor's summary [D-47]. However, the patient explicitly states in [P-19] and [P-21] that the cough has been waking her up 'pretty well every night' for the 'last month.' The Gold Answer correctly identifies the one-month duration for sleep disruption.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all four key points requested in the prompt: initial onset (3 months), sleep disruption (though timing is incorrect), productive sputum (past few days), and subjective fevers (past couple days).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer relies on the doctor's summary [D-47] to define the sleep disruption timeline, which contradicts the patient's primary account in [P-19] and [P-21]. By choosing the less accurate summary over the patient's specific testimony, it introduces a factual inaccuracy not supported by the full context of the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure, addressing each component of the timeline asked for in the question."
