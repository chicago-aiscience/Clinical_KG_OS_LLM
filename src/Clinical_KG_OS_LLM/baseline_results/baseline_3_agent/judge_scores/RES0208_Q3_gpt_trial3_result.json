  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms the doctor explicitly cited in D-36 as evidence of a general infection (“fevers and fatigue and muscle aches”) and the additional symptoms used to support that COVID-19 could not be ruled out (“difficulty breathing” plus emerging “sore throat and cough”). These match the Gold Answer and the transcript wording. No incorrect symptoms are attributed to the doctor’s D-36 summary.",
    "completeness": "It covers the two required sets of symptoms from D-36 (general infectious process: fevers/fatigue/muscle aches; COVID-not-ruled-out: dyspnea + sore throat + cough). However, the Gold Answer also highlights an important nuance: taste/smell changes were elicited earlier but were not explicitly cited by the doctor in the D-36 assessment. The Generated Answer does not mention this distinction, so it is slightly less complete relative to the Gold Answer’s full set of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All key claims are directly supported by D-36, and the brief linkage to patient-reported fatigue/shortness of breath is supported by P-1. No fabricated findings (e.g., taste/smell loss being cited by the doctor) are introduced. Citations appear appropriate and consistent with the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the exact question: which symptoms supported a general infectious process and which additional symptoms supported not ruling out COVID-19. The added ‘detailed breakdown’ remains on-topic."
