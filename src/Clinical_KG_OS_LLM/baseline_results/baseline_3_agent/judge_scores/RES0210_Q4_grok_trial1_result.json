    "correctness": "The Generated Answer falsely claims the transcript only includes patient turns and lacks the doctor's specific questions and responses, directly contradicting the provided full transcript (e.g., [D-22]/[P-22] for weight loss, [D-23]/[P-23] for travel). It provides some generally correct differentials (e.g., malignancy for weight loss, infections for travel/sick contacts, occupational disease for chemicals) aligning partially with Gold's lung cancer, TB, endemic infections, and chemical pneumonitis, but misses specifics like TB for weight loss/sick contacts, Legionella/fungal for travel, and adds unmentioned ones like COVID-19, COPD, angina. Crucially, it does not analyze how actual patient responses (no weight loss, Sarnia travel, no sick contacts, limited exposure) narrow differentials, leading to significant contradictions and omissions vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: weight loss screens lung cancer/TB, denial less likely but not excluded; travel screens exposure/infections (e.g., Legionella), Sarnia/timing noted; sick contacts for person-to-person/TB, absence reduces likelihood; chemical for pneumonitis/occ disease, limited exposure less likely; collective favors acute infection. Generated covers broad screenings (~30-40%: malignancy, infections, occupational) but misses all response-specific narrowing/maintenance, Sarnia details, TB linkages, chemical pneumonitis examples, and conclusion favoring infection; adds irrelevant symptom summary.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple hallucinations: falsely states transcript lacks doctor questions/responses ('only patient turns', no 'Relevant Transcript Segments' mentioned); ignores verifiable [D-22/P-22], [D-23/P-23], [D-24/P-24], [D-34/P-34]; cites some symptoms/family history accurately but fabricates cardiac pathology/angina/COPD not grounded in transcript or question focus; unverifiable claims about lacking data.",
    "relevance": "Partially addresses potential differentials screened by each question with general clinical reasoning, but directly evades core question element ('how did the patient's responses help narrow or maintain') by claiming responses unavailable, pivoting to unrelated symptom summary and broad differentials instead of transcript-grounded analysis."
