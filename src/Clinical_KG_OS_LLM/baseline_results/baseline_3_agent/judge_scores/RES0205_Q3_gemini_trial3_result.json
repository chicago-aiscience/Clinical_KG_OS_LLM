  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer regarding the diagnosis (COVID-19), the negative result, and the primary reasons for the investigation (hospital employment, persistent cough, and workplace anxiety).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few specific details found in the gold answer: it does not specify the patient's role as a 'clerk', it summarizes symptoms as 'flu-like' without explicitly naming the sore throat and runny nose mentioned in the gold answer, and it omits the specific timing of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and accurately cited with paragraph markers.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing all parts of the question (diagnosis, evidence, and results) without including unnecessary information."
