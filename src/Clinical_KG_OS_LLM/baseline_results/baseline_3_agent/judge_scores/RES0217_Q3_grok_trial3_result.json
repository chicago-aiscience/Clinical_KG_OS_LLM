  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the tick attachment duration (>72 hours, citing [D-6] and [P-1]), prior history of bullseye rash and antibiotics ([P-3]), and exposure history (hiking/gardening). However, it underrepresents geographic risk by focusing on general activities/habitats ([D-18]) without mentioning Strathroy, creek, or Lyme map assessment ([P-12, D-13]), which Gold emphasizes. It adds 'current localized symptoms' as a key factor (red/tender [P-1,P-6]), not central in Gold, and introduces 'knowledge graph' (KG) references absent from Gold/transcript. Patient's comment on all ticks as carriers ([P-5]) and lab testing ([D-6]) missed. Some factual discrepancies but core points align.",
    "completeness": "Covers exposure history (Fri/Sat outdoors [P-1]), duration (>72h [D-6]), prior history (bullseye rash 10y ago [P-3]); partially covers geo risk via activities/habitats but misses Strathroy/map ([P-12,D-13]). Misses patient's 'all ticks carriers' concern ([P-5]), lab ID ([D-6,D-18]), and 'safer than not' phrasing emphasis. Adds unrelated symptoms/KG. Covers ~60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: duration/exposure ([P-1,D-6]), prior ([P-3]), symptoms ([P-1,P-6]), habitats ([D-18]). Hallucinates 'knowledge graph [KG: hiking, gardening]' (no KG/transcript reference); 'confirms susceptible' is plausible inference from prior Lyme but not explicit. Citations accurate where used. Some unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by listing combination of factors (duration, geo/activities, prior history) leading to prophylaxis despite no deer tick resemblance/no rash; minor addition of symptoms but stays focused, no off-topic content."
