{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Functional/Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain, which aligns with the Gold Answer. The supporting facts provided (academic stress, history of anxiety, breathing changes when nervous, and patient attribution) are all factually accurate according to the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two significant components found in the Gold Answer: 1) The inclusion of pertinent negatives (e.g., absence of fever, asthma, exertional worsening, or palpitations outside of anxiety) which are crucial for ruling out cardiac or pulmonary pathology. 2) Explicit elaboration on the situational pattern (alone vs. distracted) using specific transcript evidence (P-4, P-9, P-29), although this was partially mentioned in the prompt itself.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are well-grounded in the source transcript. The citations [P-15, P-13, P-21, P-3, P-6, P-19, P-8] are accurate and correctly mapped to the patient's statements.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the diagnosis and the supporting clinical observations. It remains focused on the case without introducing irrelevant information."
