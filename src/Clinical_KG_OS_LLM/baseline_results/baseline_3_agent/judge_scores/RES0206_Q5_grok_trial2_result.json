  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient's 20-year half-pack smoking history [P-40] as causing COPD, aligning with Gold's 'primary risk factor.' It accurately notes the exacerbation symptoms [P-1] and doctor's attribution to infection [D-43]. However, it omits quitting at diagnosis [P-7, P-40], persistent inhaler use [P-26], detailed sick contact (dog walks, proximity [P-20]), additional infection signs (sinus pressure [P-12], headache [P-14], fever [P-9], patient's suspicion [P-23]), and past pattern [P-3]. Introduces 'knowledge graph' not in Gold or transcript, a minor discrepancy. Core facts match, so minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: smoking details/quit/inhalers [P-40,7,26]; detailed exposure [P-20]; infection evidence [P-1,12,14,9,23]; trigger/exacerbation/pattern/doctor [P-1,3,D-43]. Generated covers smoking [P-40], basic symptoms [P-1], doctor infection [D-43], vague sick contact to infection chain. Misses quit details, inhalers, exposure specifics, most infection symptoms, past pattern. Covers ~50-60% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Smoking [P-40], sputum/hemoptysis [P-1], doctor [D-43] verifiable. Sick contact implied but not detailed/cited from [P-20]. 'Knowledge graph' and causal links ([MEDICAL_HISTORY] etc.) not in transcript—hallucinated. Multiple unverifiable elements from external 'knowledge graph.'",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer into smoking-COPD and sick contact-infection-exacerbation chains, perfectly matching question's two parts with no tangents."
