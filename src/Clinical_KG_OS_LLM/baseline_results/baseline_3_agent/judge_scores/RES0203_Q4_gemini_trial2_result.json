  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain explicit denials for symptoms like fever, dyspnea, and sore throat. In reality, the transcript contains clear negative responses for fever (P-10), difficulty breathing (P-11), headaches (P-12), sore throat (P-13), chills/sweats (P-14), muscle aches (P-15), and chest pain (P-22). It also incorrectly claims negative confirmations for immunizations and family history are not visible, though they appear in P-20 and P-27.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to list the negative findings from the review of systems as requested. It misses the entire list provided in the Gold Answer (fever, dyspnea, sore throat, headache, chills, etc.). It also fails to explain how the absence of these symptoms informed the clinical picture, focusing instead on the presence of positive symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the transcript by claiming information is missing when it is clearly present. It asserts that the patient did not explicitly deny symptoms, which is directly contradicted by the dialogue in segments P-10 through P-15.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely irrelevant because it bypasses the primary request (listing negative findings) by claiming they do not exist. It pivots to discussing positive symptoms and COVID-19 testing, which was not the core of the question."
