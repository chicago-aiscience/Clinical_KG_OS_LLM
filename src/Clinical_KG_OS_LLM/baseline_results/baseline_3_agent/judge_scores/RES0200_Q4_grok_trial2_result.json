  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies 'Covid' (equivalent to COVID-19 in Gold Answer) as the alternative diagnosis to exclude due to symptom overlap with COPD exacerbation, specifies the 'covid swab' as the diagnostic test, and states the turnaround time as '24 to 48 hours', with accurate citations to [D-52], matching all facts in the Gold Answer without any errors or discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), reason (symptom overlap with COPD), specific test (COVID swab [D-52]), turnaround time (24-48 hours [D-52]). Generated Answer covers all 100%: Covid due to overlapping symptoms [D-52], covid swab [D-52], 24 to 48 hours [D-52]. Extraneous details in Gold (e.g., specific symptoms) are not required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript: 'symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid', 'covid swab', 'hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours'. Citations are precise; no unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured as a direct, bullet-point response to the three-part question (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time), with no off-topic content or tangents, perfectly addressing the query."
