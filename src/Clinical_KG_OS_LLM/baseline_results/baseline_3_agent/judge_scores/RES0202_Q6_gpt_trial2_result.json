  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s assessment of suspected COVID/viral infection, ordering a COVID swab with 24–48 hour turnaround, recommending 14-day isolation (including separating from the younger sister), noting possible false negatives, and giving the listed ER warning signs (high temperature, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, fainting). Minor wording issue: it says isolation “should include the patient's younger sister,” which could be misread as isolating together rather than isolating away from her; however it also states “to prevent potential spread,” aligning with the intended meaning in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key elements from the Gold Answer: test + turnaround, isolation duration + include separation from sister, false negatives, alternative diagnosis of another viral illness, and ER return precautions with examples. It misses the additional differential consideration from D-45 (asthma would be considered if cough/SOB without fever) and does not explicitly state the watchful-waiting/no-medications aspect (though not contradicted). Overall ~80–90% of gold points are included.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the cited transcript segments (D-44, D-45). No clear hallucinated tests, treatments, or warning signs. The only minor ambiguity is the phrasing about isolating “including the younger sister,” but the underlying concept is present in D-44.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question components (assessment/plan, test and turnaround, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negatives, and ER warning signs with examples). No significant irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The answer is highly relevant and well-grounded, accurately capturing most of the plan and warnings, but it omits the conditional asthma differential and the explicit watchful-waiting/no-medication aspect."
