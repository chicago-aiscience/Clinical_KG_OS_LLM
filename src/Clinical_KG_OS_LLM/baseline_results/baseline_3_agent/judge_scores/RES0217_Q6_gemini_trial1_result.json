{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the doctor's clinical plan as described in the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the three diagnostic tests (tick ID, blood work, physical exam), the treatment (prophylactic antibiotics), the physician consultation, and the preventive garden advice. No factual contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the primary components of the Gold Answer. It missed a few minor details: the specific mention of the 'waving motion' of the tick's legs used for identification and the specific geographic location (Strathroy) cited as a risk factor, though the latter is more context than the 'plan' itself. It captured the core plan effectively.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript. However, there is a minor hallucination/error in citation: it cites [D-5] for antibiotics, but the doctor does not mention antibiotics until [D-6]. The rest of the citations and claims are faithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured exactly according to the multi-part question, addressing diagnostics, treatments, consultations, and preventive advice specifically."
