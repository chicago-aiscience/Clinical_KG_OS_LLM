  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the three main contributors highlighted in the Gold Answer—(1) father’s heart attack in his 50s and the patient feeling scared/worried it’s a “heart thing” [P-8], (2) current smoking of ~5 cigarettes/day and difficulty quitting [P-13, P-14], and (3) major thesis-related stress in a Masters program with time-crunch pressure [P-15, P-16]. It also appropriately links anxiety during episodes with faster breathing [P-19]. However, it introduces inaccuracies/overstatements not supported by the transcript: repeated use of “he/his” for a female patient, labeling the situation as “genetic predisposition,” and asserting smoking/stress as direct causes of the chest pain via an external “Knowledge Graph.” These causal claims are not stated in the consultation; the patient only speculates it “could be stress” [P-8].",
    "completeness": "Covers the core triad (family history, smoking, stress) and describes an interaction cycle (stress → symptoms → worry due to father/smoking). Misses several key illustrative details present in the Gold Answer: father now seeing “a lot of heart doctors” and that the father is alive [P-30]; limited/unknown paternal grandfather cardiac history due to accidental death [P-30]; full smoking timeline (started ~18, up to ~10/day for ~2 years, then halved in recent months) [P-18]; other psychosocial amplifiers (living alone/hasn’t seen many people lately [P-27], nervous about running lately [P-28]); and history of anxiety attacks with concern they may return [P-22].",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript and rely on external framing (“Knowledge Graph confirms…”, explicit edge relations, and claims that smoking is a direct physiological cause of the chest pain). The transcript supports that she smokes and is stressed, and that she worries about heart disease, but does not support the asserted causal links or the “knowledge graph” content. Core cited details about father’s MI, smoking amount, and thesis stress are faithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response largely stays focused on how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with her heart-disease concern, which directly answers the question. Minor distraction comes from repeated “Knowledge Graph” references and generalized risk-factor commentary, but overall it remains on-topic."
