  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: meds = multivitamins only; allergy = penicillin; reaction = rash (no trouble breathing). Generated answer correctly identifies multivitamins and penicillin allergy, but incorrectly states the transcript does not specify the adverse reaction. This directly contradicts [P-38] where the patient says she gets a rash. It also omits the clarification of no breathing trouble.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer: (1) only multivitamins/no prescriptions, (2) penicillin allergy, (3) rash reaction, (4) no trouble breathing. Generated answer includes (1) and (2) but misses (3) and (4). Overall ~50% of key points covered.",
    "faithfulness": "Several issues: it references a “Knowledge Graph” and claims it supports pre-diabetes management with multivitamins/glucose monitoring—this is not part of the provided transcript and is unsupported. It also claims the reaction is not specified, which is contradicted by the transcript (rash). Thus multiple ungrounded/incorrect claims.",
    "relevance": "It addresses all parts of the question (medications, allergy, reaction) and stays mostly on-topic, but includes an irrelevant/unsupported “Knowledge Graph” mention and meta commentary."
