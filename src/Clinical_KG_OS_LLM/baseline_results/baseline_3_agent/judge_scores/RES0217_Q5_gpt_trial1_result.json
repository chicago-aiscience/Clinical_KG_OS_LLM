  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is partially correct on attachment duration: it accurately reflects that the patient was outdoors Friday and Saturday (P-1) and that the doctor inferred this implied >72 hours (D-6). However, it is factually incorrect in the second half: it claims there is no evidence the doctor used an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map or Strathroy’s geographic position to justify prophylaxis, but the transcript explicitly shows the doctor referencing the map and concluding Strathroy is “close enough to be considered…concerning,” supporting antibiotics (D-13). This is a major contradiction of the source and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) hiking Friday + gardening Saturday with uncertainty about acquisition, leading physician to estimate >72 hours and recommend prophylactic antibiotics (P-1, D-6). Key points missed/incorrect: (2) the doctor explicitly used the Ontario Lyme distribution map and Strathroy’s proximity to a risk area as additional justification to proceed with antibiotics (D-13). It also fails to state the combined reasoning (duration + geographic risk) leading to the decision to move forward with antibiotics (D-13).",
    "faithfulness": "Most duration-related statements are grounded in the transcript (P-1, D-6). However, the statement that the transcript does not contain evidence of map-based reasoning is directly contradicted by D-13 (the doctor explicitly references the Lyme map and Strathroy being concerning). This undermines faithfulness. Other points (ticks in long grass; localized redness/tenderness) are in the transcript but are presented as if they were primary justification for prophylaxis, which is not clearly supported compared with the stated duration and map reasoning.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on the question’s topics (timing/attachment duration and geographic/map-based risk). However, it fails to answer the second part correctly by denying the map-based justification, reducing how well it addresses the full question."
