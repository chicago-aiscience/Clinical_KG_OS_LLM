  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all three key factual elements from the Gold Answer: COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All facts are consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all essential points from the Gold Answer: the alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), the specific test (COVID swab), and the turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, it lacks the contextual detail about symptom overlap that the Gold Answer provides, such as the mention of worsening cough, shortness of breath, and chills. The Gold Answer also includes a more complete quote from the doctor explaining the rationale. This represents approximately 85% coverage of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The answer uses appropriate citations and does not introduce any information not present in the source material. The formatting and presentation differ slightly from the transcript but the content is entirely grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question without any extraneous information. The bullet-point format makes it easy to identify the answer to each specific question component. No off-topic content is present."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies all three required elements (alternative diagnosis, diagnostic test, and turnaround time) with perfect factual accuracy and complete faithfulness to the transcript. While it covers the essential information, it lacks some of the contextual detail about symptom overlap present in the Gold Answer, resulting in a slightly lower completeness score. The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the question in a clear, concise format."
