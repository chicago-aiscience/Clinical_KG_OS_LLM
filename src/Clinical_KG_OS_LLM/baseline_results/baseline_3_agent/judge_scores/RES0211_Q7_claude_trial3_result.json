  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptom progression: scratchy throat first, followed by dry cough, which matches the Gold Answer. It also accurately describes the sensation of feeling hot as concurrent/constant rather than sequenced before or after specific symptoms. The characterization aligns with the Gold Answer's statement that 'the transcript does not specify the exact day the feeling of heat began relative to the throat and cough onset.' No factual errors are present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the primary sequence (throat → cough) and addresses the relationship of feeling hot to the timeline. However, it omits several key points from the Gold Answer: the 3-4 day timeframe is not explicitly stated, the headache progression is not mentioned, general malaise/fatigue are not detailed, and the systemic nature of symptoms (localized to broader) is not discussed. It covers approximately 60-70% of the key information.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript. The progression from throat to cough is stated in P-4, the feeling hot is described in P-7 and P-9, and the concurrent nature of symptoms is evident from P-1 where multiple symptoms are reported together. Citations [P-4], [P-1], [P-7], [P-9] are accurate and appropriate. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about symptom order and the relationship of feeling hot to the timeline. It stays focused on the core question without tangents. However, it could be more thorough in describing the complete progression to fully answer 'how symptoms progressed over three to four days.'"

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate and well-grounded response that correctly identifies the initial symptom progression (throat → cough) and appropriately characterizes the sensation of feeling hot as concurrent rather than sequenced. All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it lacks the completeness of the Gold Answer, omitting details about the timeframe, headache development, malaise, fatigue, and the systemic nature of symptom progression. The response is highly relevant and focused on the question but would benefit from more comprehensive coverage of the multi-day progression."
