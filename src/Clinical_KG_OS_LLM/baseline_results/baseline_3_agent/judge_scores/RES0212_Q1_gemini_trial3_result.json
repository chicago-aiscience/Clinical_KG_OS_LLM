  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript. It correctly identifies the 3-month duration, the recent worsening, the sputum characteristics, and the associated fatigue/sleep issues. However, it misses the subjective fevers ('feeling hot at night') and the specific progression from a dry to a productive cough mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers less than half of the key points in the Gold Answer. It misses the subjective fevers and the impact on exercise. More significantly, it omits the majority of the 'symptoms explicitly denied' section, failing to mention night sweats, weight loss, foul smell, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. Every claim made is supported by a specific quote or reference to the dialogue, and it avoids any hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all components of the prompt: respiratory symptoms, characteristics of cough/sputum, associated symptoms, and denials."
