  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. Most notably, it claims the transcript does not state the frequency of diarrhea, whereas P-28 explicitly states 'five or six times a day.' It also fails to provide the specific numerical severity rating for the headache (7/10), which was explicitly asked for and is present in the transcript (P-8).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the 'dry' nature of the cough (P-12), the specific frequency of diarrhea (P-28), and the numerical pain score for the headache (P-8). It also omits all pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer (no blood, no sputum, etc.).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a limitation in the source text by stating the transcript 'does not explicitly state a specific frequency' for diarrhea, when the transcript clearly contains this information at P-28.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address all parts of the question but fails to extract the specific values requested (frequency of diarrhea and numerical headache rating), which were the core components of the prompt."
