  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the first symptom as a scratchy throat followed by a dry cough (matches Gold: P-4). It accurately notes that the feeling hot was described as persistent/constant and that the transcript does not clearly anchor its onset to before vs after throat/cough (matches Gold: P-7, P-9; Gold explicitly says timing relative to cough/throat is unspecified). Minor overreach: stating the feeling hot occurred “concurrently” with the respiratory symptoms and “followed shortly thereafter” for cough implies a tighter temporal relationship than the transcript explicitly provides, though it does not directly contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key early sequence (scratchy throat → dry cough) and addresses how “feeling hot” relates to the timeline (constant during the illness; exact start relative to cough/throat not specified; doctor summarized as mild fever). It omits several Gold Answer progression elements that were part of the 3–4 day course: pounding headache/active headache (P-1, P-2), general malaise/feeling crappy (P-1, P-14), and fatigue/tiredness (P-13), and the Gold’s framing of progression from localized URI symptoms to broader systemic symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript and appropriately referenced (P-4, P-7, P-9; D-58 for “little bit of fever”). The “concurrently”/“alongside” phrasing is a reasonable synthesis but not explicitly timestamped in the transcript, making it a minor inference rather than a directly verifiable statement. No major hallucinated symptoms or events.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by stating the symptom order (initial symptom then progression) and explicitly addressing how the ‘feeling hot’ symptom relates temporally to the cough/throat symptoms. No notable irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The answer is accurate and well-focused on throat→cough and the non-specific timing of feeling hot, but it is moderately incomplete because it omits the additional symptom progression (headache, malaise, fatigue) described in the Gold Answer."
