  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the illness began ~2 weeks prior and that early symptoms included “flu symptoms,” with mucus described as whitish/clear for ~4–5 days followed by a dry cough. However, it introduces an inaccurate/unsupported characterization of cough frequency (“remained high throughout”), whereas the transcript states frequency did not increase and is about 3–4 times per hour. It also does not accurately report the course of cough intensity (which remained “kind of the same”).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: 2-week duration; early flu-like symptoms; mucus appearance (whitish/clear) and duration (4–5 days); transition to dry cough. Key elements missed/undercovered: explicit sore throat and runny nose with their resolution timing; statement that all other symptoms resolved by day 3–4; no fever at any point; cough intensity stayed the same; cough frequency stayed stable with estimate (3–4/hour) and spontaneous/no triggers; at-the-time-only symptom is dry cough (and chest soreness described as soreness).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (mucus description/duration; transition to dry cough; early flu symptoms resolving in 3–4 days; cough persists). However, the claim that frequency remained “high throughout” is not supported, and the answer omits transcript-supported details about stability of intensity/frequency and lack of triggers. This constitutes some ungrounded/inaccurate inference.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested symptom timeline (flu-like onset, mucus phase, transition to dry cough, persistence). It remains on-topic, but provides an incomplete account of the intensity/frequency changes and other symptom resolution details requested in the question."

  "summary": "The answer is generally on-topic and captures the mucus-to-dry-cough transition, but it omits several requested timeline details (other symptoms, fever, triggers, quantified frequency) and contains an unsupported statement about cough frequency."
