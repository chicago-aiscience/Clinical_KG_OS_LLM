{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID (matching transcript's 'covid' and Gold's 'COVID-19') as the condition to rule out, the swab test with 24-48 hour turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis if negative, with all facts fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]; no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: rule out COVID-19, swab test ordered, 24-48 hours TAT, alternative of another viral illness if negative; also mentions isolation for 14 days, public health contact tracing if positive, and supportive management either way. Generated covers condition, test, TAT, and alternative (core 80-99%), but omits isolation, contact tracing, and management details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (rule out COVID due to symptom overlap, swab test with 24-48h results, alternative viral illness) are directly verifiable in transcript [D-52]; citations accurate, no hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured perfectly to address the question's three parts (condition to rule out, test + TAT, alternative diagnosis if negative) with no off-topic content."
