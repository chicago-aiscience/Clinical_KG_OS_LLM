  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer includes core facts like the seizure last night due to missed Keppra [P-8, P-9, P-23], sudden shortness of breath upon waking [P-1], temperature check at 37.4°C [P-5], and decision to seek care [P-1], consistent with Gold. However, it inaccurately states the patient 'woke up in the evening' for the seizure (not in Gold or transcript; Gold says 'later that night'), omits the daughter's birthday celebration as the cause of missing the dose [P-24], fails to mention the dry cough [P-2, P-4], 3-hour symptom onset [P-11], prior lack of shortness of breath [P-3], and uncertainty about seizure relation [P-8], and adds irrelevant family history [P-26]. It also misrepresents the temperature as confirmed fever via a non-existent knowledge graph. These are some factual errors/omissions but main timeline points are correct. Score: 3.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: evening birthday celebration disrupting routine [P-24]; forgot Keppra dose [P-9, P-24]; seizure later night, fine after, bed [P-8]; morning sudden SOB [P-1]; dry cough [P-2, P-4]; symptoms ~3 hours prior [P-11]; temp check 37.4°C [P-5, P-6]; never SOB before [P-3]; decided to seek care due to uncertainty [P-1]; mentioned seizure with relation uncertainty [P-8]. Generated covers: seizure night/missed Keppra (partial), SOB onset, temp check, seek care decision (~5/10 points, 50%). Misses: birthday/precise missed dose cause, cough, 3-hour timing, never before, relation uncertainty. Covers 50-79%. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like seizure last night [P-8], fine after [P-8], missed med Keppra [P-9, P-23], SOB on waking [P-1], temp 37.4°C [P-5], seek care [P-1] are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, 'woke up in the evening' for seizure is not in transcript (hallucination); family history [P-26] is verifiable but tangential; 'clinical knowledge graph confirms fever [LAB_RESULT: 37.4°C --[CONFIRMS]--> SYMPTOM: fever]' is entirely fabricated (no graph, no LAB_RESULT, transcript calls it 'mild'). Multiple hallucinated facts. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly reconstructs a timeline from evening before (seizure) to morning consultation (SOB, temp, seek care), structured chronologically and addressing all specified events (seizure, respiratory onset, temp check, decision to seek care). Minor tangents like family history and knowledge graph but mostly focused on question. Score: 4."
