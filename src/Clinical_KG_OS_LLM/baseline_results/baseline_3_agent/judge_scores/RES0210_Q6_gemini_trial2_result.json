  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain the doctor's plan; however, the transcript clearly shows the doctor planning to consult with a supervising physician and return to the patient. It correctly identifies Tylenol and coughing but fails on the primary query about the plan.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses approximately 70% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It omits self-care measures like expectoration and resting, and fails to mention critical aggravating factors such as deep breathing and physical exertion (climbing stairs).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript regarding the points it does include, but it hallucinations the presence of a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not part of the provided source material. It also falsely claims the absence of information that is present in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly attempting to answer all components of the prompt, even though the content is lacking or incorrect."
