{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that there is 'no explicit evidence' of the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, or nausea, while the transcript clearly records these questions and the patient's denials in segments [D-10] through [D-17].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to list any of the negated symptoms requested by the question. Instead, it focuses on confirmed symptoms, which were not the primary focus of the prompt. It misses all the key points regarding how specific negative findings help exclude cardiac, gastrointestinal, or neurological causes.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates a significant failure in faithfulness by claiming the information is missing from the transcript when it is explicitly present. It appears to have restricted its analysis to an arbitrary segment range ([D-36] to [P-11]) which doesn't even make sense chronologically, leading to a hallucination that the data doesn't exist.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly irrelevant to the specific prompt because it fails to address the first part of the question (negated symptoms) and consequently provides a weak and misguided answer to the second part (differentiation)."
