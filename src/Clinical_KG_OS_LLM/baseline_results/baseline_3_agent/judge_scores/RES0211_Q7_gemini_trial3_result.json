  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the scratchy throat as the initial symptom followed by the dry cough. It also accurately reflects that the feeling of heat was a constant, concurrent symptom rather than having a specific start point relative to the respiratory symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points including the specific order of symptoms (throat then cough) and the nature of the feeling of heat (concurrent and constant). It mentions the headache ('head pounding') and malaise ('feeling crappy'). However, it omits the specific mention of fatigue and the 'three to four days' timeframe from its descriptive text, both of which were present in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The sequence of symptoms is supported by [P-4], and the description of feeling hot is supported by [P-7], [P-9], and the physician's summary in [D-58]. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the order of symptom progression and the relationship of the heat sensation to the timeline."
