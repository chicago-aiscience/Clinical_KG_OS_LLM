  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies Keppra as the medication prescribed for epilepsy, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-23, P-8]. It correctly states that the patient forgot to take their medication [P-9], which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it lacks the specific details of the daughter's birthday celebration and routine change [P-24] that the Gold Answer emphasizes as the precise circumstance, representing a minor discrepancy in depth while keeping core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Keppra for epilepsy [P-23, P-8] - covered; (2) forgot medication [P-9] - covered; (3) specific circumstance: daughter's birthday celebration, usually takes with dinner but had early celebration, did things differently, no later dinner, completely forgot [P-24] - not covered; (4) doctor acknowledgment [D-25], isolated lapse [D-24, P-24], seizure link [P-9] - not covered. Covers the medication and basic forgetting (about 50-60% of core points), but misses the detailed specific circumstance.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript: Keppra [P-23], epilepsy context [P-8, P-22], forgetting [P-9]. Citations are accurate [P-23, P-9]. No unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by specifying the medication (Keppra for epilepsy) and the circumstance of missing the dose (forgetting), with no irrelevant or off-topic information."
