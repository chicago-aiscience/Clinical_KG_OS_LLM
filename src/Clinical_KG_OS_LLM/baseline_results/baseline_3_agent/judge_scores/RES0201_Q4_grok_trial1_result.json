  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies only the denial of smell loss as a negative finding, while the Gold Answer lists multiple specific denied symptoms (cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell, fever, chills/night sweats) with citations, plus denials of prior breathing difficulty, sick contacts, and travel. It misclassifies mostly positive symptoms (sore throat, swallowing issues, breathing difficulty, muscle ache) as 'screened for' per a hallucinated Knowledge Graph. Differential analysis partially touches on mono (history noted in both) but incorrectly uses absence of anosmia to distinguish from 'classic' COVID-19 (anosmia is common but not defining) and relies on non-transcript KG links, contradicting Gold's note of no explicit differentials discussed. Significant factual errors and omissions compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 7 specific denied symptoms (cough [D-15/P-15], runny nose [D-16/P-16], headaches [D-17/P-17], chest pain [D-18/P-18], loss of smell [D-19/P-19], fever [D-23/P-23], chills/night sweats [D-24/P-24]), plus 3 other denials (prior breathing [D-11/P-11], sick contacts [D-12/P-12], travel [D-13/P-13]), screening pattern for other possibilities, absence of cough/runny nose narrowing from URI, denial of chest pain relevant to breathing issue, lack of fever/chills not dissuading COVID suspicion, mono history noted but not explored. Generated covers only loss of smell denial (~10-15% coverage) and partial mono/COVID distinction; misses nearly all.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about 'Knowledge Graph' (e.g., symptoms screened per KG, links like smell loss --[INDICATES]--> covid, mononucleosis to sore throat but not smell loss) are entirely absent from transcript – hallucination. Some accurate citations (e.g., [P-19] for no smell loss, [P-5] for mono history, [D-43] for COVID suspicion), but lists affirmed symptoms (sore throat [P-2], taste loss [P-19/21], muscle ache [P-25]) as screened negatives incorrectly. Multiple hallucinated elements undermine grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses denied symptoms (focusing on smell loss) and role in distinguishing differentials (COVID presentation, mono) from suspected COVID-19, aligning with question's two parts. Includes irrelevant KG tangents and misfocus on positive symptoms, but core content is on-topic without major digressions."
