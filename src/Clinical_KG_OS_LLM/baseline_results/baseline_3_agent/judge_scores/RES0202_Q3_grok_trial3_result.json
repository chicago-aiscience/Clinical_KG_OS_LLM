  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies a triad: dry cough worsening over three days (P-1, P-5, P-12), fever >100°F (100.1/101, P-1/P-2), possible loss of taste (P-17). Doctor aligns symptoms with COVID (D-44, quoted as 'aligned' but transcript says 'allowed'), uses fever to conclude infection vs. asthma (D-45), notes acute onset/systemic symptoms. Generated Answer matches triad closely (cough worsening over days P-1/P-5, fever same cites, taste P-17), quotes D-44/D-45 accurately per transcript ('allowed'), explains reasoning similarly including distinction from asthma and systemic changes like appetite. Minor issues: says 'two days' vs. 'three', 'patient reported' vs. parent, omits fatigue explicitly, but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers triad fully (respiratory dry cough worsening, fever specifics, taste change with cites); doctor's alignment to COVID (D-44); use of fever to conclude infection/distinguish asthma (D-45); mentions appetite loss as systemic. Misses explicit 'three days' (cites P-12), acute onset phrasing, fatigue, isolation/testing details, full systemic involvement summary (~85-90% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All symptom descriptions and cites (P-1, P-2, P-5, P-17) directly verifiable in transcript; D-44 quote 'allowed with' exact to transcript; D-45 explanation matches verbatim context on fever vs. cough-only for infection vs. asthma. No hallucinations; minor phrasing like 'Dr.' or 'patient' interpretive but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around exact symptom triad (respiratory, temperature, taste) and doctor's collective use for COVID alignment and infectious conclusion, mirroring question precisely with no tangents."
