  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that Jessica carries Claritin for seasonal allergies and is not actively taking it at the moment (consistent with [P-25] and aligned with the Gold Answer). It also correctly notes she takes birth control, but it omits the specific name (“Deyo”) and the key dosing schedule detail (“the one that goes for three months”), both required by the question and present in the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states that no dosing/frequency details were mentioned—there are dosing-like frequency details for both allergy shots (“once a week for a little while”) and the contraceptive cycle (“goes for three months”). It also introduces an unsupported reference to a “knowledge graph,” and it speculates about the birth control indication (“common contraceptive”) rather than sticking to transcript-grounded content.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Claritin carried “just in case” and not currently taking it; (2) allergy shots mentioned (in general). Key points missed: (1) the contraceptive name “Deyo”; (2) contraceptive regimen detail (“goes for three months”); (3) allergy shot frequency/timing (“once a week…in the winter before”); (4) she denies medication allergies; (5) she does not carry an EpiPen and allergies are seasonal/non-anaphylactic. Overall, the answer includes some main elements but misses multiple required specifics and several related clarifications present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are broadly consistent with the transcript (Claritin carried; on birth control; has had allergy shots). However, it contains non-transcript elements (“knowledge graph indicates…”) and adds an inference about the indication of birth control rather than limiting to what was said. It also claims no dosing details were mentioned, which contradicts transcript content about frequency/timing (weekly shots; 3‑month pill). These issues reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications she is taking/carrying and past allergist treatments, which is what the question asks. Minor irrelevant/unhelpful content includes the “knowledge graph” reference and the generic speculation about birth control indication."

  "summary": "Partially accurate and on-topic, but it omits multiple key specifics (Deyo name, 3‑month regimen, weekly winter shots, no EpiPen, no med allergies) and includes some ungrounded/incorrect statements about dosing details and a non-transcript “knowledge graph” reference."
