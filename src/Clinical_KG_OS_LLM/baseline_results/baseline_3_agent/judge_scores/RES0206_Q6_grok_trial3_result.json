  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab, consultation with attending, decision criteria based on labs and vitals, and plan to return to patient, all matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-43]. Minor discrepancies include not explicitly listing 'labs' under diagnostic testing (though mentioned in criteria) and omitting the clinical impression of COPD exacerbation from infection and the earlier temperature reference, but core facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: physical exam/vitals/chest (yes), COVID swab (yes), labs (mentioned in criteria), clinical impression (missed), disposition criteria (yes), consult attending (yes), return to discuss (yes). Patient agreement and temp context missed, covering ~85% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All elements directly verifiable in [D-43]: physical exam/vitals/chest, COVID swab, labs/vitals for decision, attending consult, return to patient. No hallucinations or unverifiable claims; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the comprehensive plan in bullets covering exams, tests, consultations, and exact decision criteria for ER admission vs discharge, with no off-topic content."
