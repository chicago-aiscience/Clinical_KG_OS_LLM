  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several major factual errors. Most significantly, it claims that questions about fever, runny nose, and sick contacts were 'not present in the transcript segments provided,' which is false (see D-7, D-8, and D-10). It also fails to correctly identify that the doctor was attempting to 'exclude' infectious causes like pneumonia, bronchitis, and travel-related illnesses based on the negative responses, as outlined in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It does not mention the exclusion of pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory infections, travel-related infections, systemic conditions (via rashes), or musculoskeletal issues (via pain). It focuses on a final diagnosis rather than the diagnostic reasoning for the specific symptoms mentioned in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that certain information was missing from the transcript. It also incorrectly cites turn IDs (e.g., citing [D-14] and [D-20] as examples of missing fever/runny nose questions, when [D-14] is about pain and [D-20] is about growth).",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it attempts to discuss the differential diagnosis, it fails to address the core of the question: what specific conditions were being screened for or excluded by the specific list of symptoms (fever, runny nose, etc.)."
