  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details the connection via same-night timing [P-8, P-24], patient's attribution in P-9 as voluntary response to D-9, rarity of seizures, specific reason for missing dose (daughter's birthday disrupting routine), and notes no clinician confirmation. Generated Answer correctly identifies missed Keppra as linked to seizure, quotes P-9 accurately for patient's recognition, and cites P-23 for medication name. However, it introduces external knowledge ('non-adherence is a known precipitant') not emphasized in Gold or transcript, which bases causality on patient's report and timing rather than general medical fact. Core facts match, minor discrepancy in adding untranscribed rationale.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: (1) same-night seizure after missed dose [P-8, P-24]; (2) P-9 attribution ('forgot med, might have'); (3) voluntary in response to D-9 on post-seizure history; (4) unprompted by adherence question; (5) seizures usually rare [P-9]; (6) missed due to birthday routine change [P-24]; (7) no clinician causality confirmation. Covered: missed Keppra-seizure link, P-9 recognition/quote, Keppra via P-23. Missed: timing details, birthday explanation, rarity, response context, no prompting, no confirmation. Covers main recognition and basic link (~60% of depth).",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims [P-9 quote, P-23 Keppra] verifiable and accurate in transcript. Patient's recognition grounded in P-9. However, 'causally linked because non-adherence is a known precipitant' is plausible external knowledge not stated in transcript (transcript only has patient's belief, no confirmation); Gold emphasizes patient's recognition without generalizing. Minor unverifiable addition, but core content grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both question parts: explains connection (missed dose causality) and patient's recognition (P-9 evidence with quote), no off-topic content."
