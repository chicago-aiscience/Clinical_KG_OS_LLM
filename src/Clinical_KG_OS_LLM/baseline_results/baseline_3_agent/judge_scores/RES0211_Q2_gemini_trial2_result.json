  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error by stating that no dosing details were mentioned, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions that the birth control 'goes for three months' [P-27] and allergy shots were 'once a week' [P-20]. It also fails to provide the specific name of the birth control medication ('Deyo'), which was explicitly asked for and provided in the transcript [P-26].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to name the birth control ('Deyo'), misses the dosing/frequency details (three months, once a week), does not mention the denial of medication allergies, and misses the mention that she does not carry an EpiPen.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes a hallucination by referencing a 'knowledge graph [KG]' which is not part of the provided source transcript. It also incorrectly claims information (dosing details) is missing when it is present in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and follows the requested structure, but fails to deliver the specific details (names and dosing) requested by the prompt."
