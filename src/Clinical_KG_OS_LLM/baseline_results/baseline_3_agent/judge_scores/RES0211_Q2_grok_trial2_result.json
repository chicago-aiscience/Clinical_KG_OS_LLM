  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies 'Deyo' as the birth control pill with details like 'goes for three months' and confirmation it's oral not IUD, while Generated uses generic 'Birth Control' without name, dosing, or confirmation details (error); Claritin status is mostly accurate but Generated implies doctor lists it as taken via D-58 which overlooks patient nuance of carrying not taking; past allergy shots lack dosing details (once a week in winter) and include erroneous [KG] citation; misses no med allergies, no EpiPen, allergy specifics; core facts present but significant omissions and inaccuracies like missing specific name and details.",
    "completeness": "Covers Claritin (carry, allergies), generic birth control (taking), allergy shots (past, seasonal); misses key points: 'Deyo' name, three-month pill, oral confirmation, no med allergies, allergy shots dosing/frequency (once weekly in winter), no EpiPen, seasonal allergy details without anaphylaxis; covers ~50-60% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded (e.g., Claritin [P-25, P-15]); hallucinations/mis-cites: [KG] for shots (no KG in transcript), D-58 incorrectly claimed to confirm birth control taking (D-58 only mentions Claritin); birth control indication plausible but noted as not explicit; some unverifiable/misattributed claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around current medications carried/taken (Claritin, birth control) and past treatments (allergy shots) with indications, addresses question perfectly without tangents or off-topic content."
