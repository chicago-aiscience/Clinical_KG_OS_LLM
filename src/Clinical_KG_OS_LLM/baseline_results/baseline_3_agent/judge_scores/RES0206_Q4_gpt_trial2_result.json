  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition to rule out (COVID-19) and the ordered test (a COVID swab), consistent with D-43. However, it is incorrect in stating the transcript contains no details about recent social contacts; the patient explicitly reports meeting friends to walk dogs and that one friend was sick (P-20), which prompted consideration of COVID. This makes the third requested element wrong, though the first two are accurate.",
    "completeness": "Gold answer key points: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) order COVID swab, (3) exposure/social contact detail: dog-walking with friends, one was sick, sometimes walked too close/outside, and friend’s COVID test status unknown. Generated answer includes (1) and (2) but omits/denies (3) and does not mention the close-proximity/outdoors nuance or uncertainty about the friend’s testing. Thus it covers about 2 of the 3 core elements asked, but misses important supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the transcript 'does not contain any details regarding the patient's recent social contacts' is contradicted by P-20 (and follow-up D-21/P-21), making the response not well-grounded in the transcript. Other statements (symptoms suggest infection) are generally consistent with the encounter, but the incorrect denial of available exposure history is a major faithfulness issue.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked items (condition, test, and prompting contact history), with only minor additional explanation. However, it fails to provide the correct social-contact prompting detail, which reduces how well it addresses the full question."
