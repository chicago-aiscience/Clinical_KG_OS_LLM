  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the tick attachment duration reasoning from the Gold Answer and transcript, citing P-1 and D-6 correctly for hiking/gardening on Friday/Saturday leading to >72 hours attachment and prophylactic antibiotics. However, it significantly contradicts the Gold Answer and transcript by claiming 'the provided transcript does not contain evidence' of the doctor using the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map or Strathroy's position, despite clear evidence in D-13 where the doctor references the map and states 'Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point' to justify antibiotics. This is a major factual error.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: patient's Friday hiking and Saturday gardening [P-1], uncertainty of attachment, discovery 'earlier today' [D-1 implied], doctor's timeline confirmation [D-2], explicit >72 hours estimate [D-6], and prophylactic decision [D-6]. Missed entirely: geographic risk from Strathroy hiking [P-12], doctor's reference to Ontario Lyme map and assessment of Strathroy as 'concerning' [D-13], linking to antibiotics decision [D-13]. Covers duration (~60-70% of points) but 0% of geographic points, overall ~50-60%.",
    "faithfulness": "Duration claims verifiable: P-1 (activities), D-6 (>72 hours). Geographic claim 'no evidence' in transcript is false/hallucinated, as D-13 explicitly mentions Lyme map, Strathroy's position, and concern leading to antibiotics. Adds unverifiable/plausible but non-central justifications (D-18 on tick habitats/gardening as exposure risk, P-1 symptoms), not primary treatment rationales from transcript. Multiple inaccuracies about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the two-part question (duration and map/geographic use), with sections matching query. Minor tangent in alternative justifications, but focused on addressing query despite errors."
