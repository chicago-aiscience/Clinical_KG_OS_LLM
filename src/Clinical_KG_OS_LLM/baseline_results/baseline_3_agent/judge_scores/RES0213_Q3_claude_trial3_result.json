  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety-related/stress-induced chest pain, which aligns with the Gold Answer's assessment. The key diagnostic elements are accurate - it recognizes the role of academic stress, history of anxiety, and stress-related somatic symptoms. However, it uses the term 'Functional Chest Pain' which is less precise than the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' The core diagnosis is consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It includes: (1) academic stress and thesis deadline, (2) history of teenage anxiety attacks, (3) patient's self-attribution to stress, and (4) breathing symptoms during episodes. However, it significantly omits: (1) the crucial situational pattern where pain occurs when alone and resolves with distraction/social engagement [P-4, P-9, P-29], (2) the detailed pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, pain at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety, no asthma), and (3) the specific pattern of symptoms resolving during hands-on tasks or social interaction.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. All claims reference appropriate sections: academic stress [P-15, P-13], anxiety history [P-21], breathing symptoms [P-19], and patient's stress attribution [P-8]. The citations are accurate and verifiable. However, it lacks the comprehensive citation coverage seen in the Gold Answer, particularly missing the critical observations about situational triggers and resolution patterns.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying the diagnosis and providing supporting clinical observations. It stays focused on the relevant diagnostic reasoning without tangential information. The response is well-structured and pertinent to what was asked, though it could have been more comprehensive in addressing all aspects of the question regarding 'which specific clinical observations support this reasoning.'"

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a correct diagnosis of anxiety-related chest pain supported by accurate clinical observations from the transcript. It successfully identifies key elements including academic stress, anxiety history, and somatic symptoms with proper citations. However, it falls short in completeness by omitting the critical situational pattern (symptoms when alone, resolution with distraction/social engagement) and pertinent negative findings that the Gold Answer comprehensively details. While factually accurate and relevant, the response would benefit from more thorough coverage of the supporting clinical observations, particularly the distinctive contextual triggers that strongly support the diagnosis."
