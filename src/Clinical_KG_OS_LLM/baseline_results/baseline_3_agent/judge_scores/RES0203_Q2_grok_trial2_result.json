  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient tried no prior medications or treatments, matching the Gold Answer's citation of [D-9, P-9] and [D-24, P-24], though it does not explicitly cite these. It correctly identifies the doctor's recommendation as a COVID-19 test via swab [D-39] with matching instructions on timeline and isolation [D-39]. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer; minor omission of 'did not prescribe medication' is implied.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: no prior treatments (main point), COVID test via swab, results timeline, self-isolation instructions including extension if negative. Missed: explicit no regular medications [D-24, P-24], mention of no medication prescribed, possible other tests, and consulting supervising physician [D-40]. Covers ~85-90% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All core claims (no prior treatments, test recommendation, swab, timeline, isolation) directly verifiable in transcript [D-9/P-9, D-39]. Citations accurate. Minor issue: references non-existent 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript), but no hallucinated facts about content.",
    "relevance": "Answer is structured perfectly around the question: prior treatments (none), doctor's recommendation (test), specific intervention (swab), and associated instructions (timeline, isolation). No off-topic content."
