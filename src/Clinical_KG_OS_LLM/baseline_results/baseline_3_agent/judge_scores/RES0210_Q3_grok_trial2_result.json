  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details productive cough with yellow sputum [P-6] and red spots [P-4,P-6], fever [P-8], chills [P-9], exertional dyspnea [P-10,P-11], detailed right-sided pleuritic chest pain [P-17-21], and smoking [P-37,P-38]. Generated covers sputum accurately, fever/chills (minor cite discrepancy P-5 vs P-8), right chest pain [P-17], and pleuritic explanation, but omits dyspnea entirely, provides incomplete pain details (misses constant/dull/present at rest), misattributes P-15 (sore throat) to chest pain worsening, omits smoking; core diagnostic reasoning aligns but with notable gaps and errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: sputum details (100%), fever/chills (~80%), pleuritic pain explanation (~70%). Missed: exertional dyspnea [P-10,P-11] (major), full chest pain characterization (constant, dull, worsens deep breath specifically [P-18-21], present lying [P-20]), smoking history [P-37,P-38]; covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: sputum [P-4,P-6], cough [P-1], fever/chills [P-5,P-9], pain location [P-17], Tylenol [P-14]. Errors: P-15 cited for chest pain worsening with cough ('raw' after coughing is sore throat, not chest; actual [P-18,P-19]); infers right lung sputum origin (not specified); adds un-transcript pathophysiol (pleura lubrication/mechanism, plausible but not grounded); minor 'knowledge graph' mention (absent); some hallucinated attribution but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists transcript findings supporting pneumonia, explains pleuritic pain's diagnostic role with structure matching question; no tangents, perfectly focused despite flaws."
