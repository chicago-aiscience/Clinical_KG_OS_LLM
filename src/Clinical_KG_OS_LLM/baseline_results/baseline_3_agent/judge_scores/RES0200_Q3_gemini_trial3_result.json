  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the triad of symptoms (worsening cough, sputum changes, dyspnea) and the history of COPD as mentioned in the transcript. It accurately quotes the doctor's assessment logic from [D-52]. It cites [P-1] for the history, though [P-2] provides the more precise 'five years' figure noted in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points requested by the question. However, it is slightly less detailed than the Gold Answer, omitting the specific duration (5 years vs 'a few years') and the specific medications (Ventolin, Spiriva) that establish the severity and management of the chronic history.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer includes a reference to a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source context. While the clinical facts themselves are grounded in the transcript, referencing an external source not present in the provided text is a minor hallucination of the context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question: the specific symptoms/history and the doctor's linking logic."
