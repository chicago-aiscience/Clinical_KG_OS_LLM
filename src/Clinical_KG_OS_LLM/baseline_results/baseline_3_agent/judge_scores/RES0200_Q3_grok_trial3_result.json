  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (worsening cough [P-1], sputum changes [P-6], increased dyspnea [P-1]) matching the Gold Answer's cardinal symptoms, and correctly notes the established COPD history and the doctor's explicit linkage in [D-52] with accurate quote. Minor discrepancies: uses P-1 for cough/dyspnea (valid but Gold uses P-5/P-8 for more detail); COPD duration 'few years' vs Gold's 'five years [P-2]'; omits inhalers. Core facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key Gold points: triad of worsening cough, sputum change, increased dyspnea; COPD history; doctor's synthesis in [D-52] ('cough and shortness of breath... getting worse... past history of COPD'). Misses details like cough triggered by stairs [P-5], sputum baseline clear-white to yellow, SOB needing rest after walks [P-8], exact 5-year history [P-2], inhalers [P-11]. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms and citations verifiable in transcript (P-1, P-6, D-52 accurate). Doctor's quote exact. Hallucinations: 'knowledge graph' mentioned twice, claimed to support reasoning with COPD symptoms—not in transcript. These are unverifiable additions, but plausible general knowledge; mostly grounded otherwise.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by specifying the exact symptom combination (triad), COPD history, and doctor's linkage with quote; structured response perfectly focused on query despite minor intro/outro."
