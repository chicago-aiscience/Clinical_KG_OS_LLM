{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key elements of the management plan as described in the Gold Answer, including diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), physical exam of the chest, self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate), timeline (24-48 hours), public health nurse contact if positive, and disposition based on test results. Minor discrepancies include slightly incorrect citations (e.g., attributing chest X-ray and physical exam to [D-36] instead of [D-37]) and categorizing physical exam under diagnostic tests, but core facts are fully consistent with no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers 100% of Gold Answer key points: comprehensive plan citation, physical exam details ([D-37, D-38]), diagnostic tests with reasons, self-isolation specifics and source (doctor [D-37]), timeline and nurse contact, disposition criteria (based on results, no thresholds), and progression to exam. No key points missed.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript, primarily [D-37] (tests, exam, isolation, timeline, nurse, criteria) and [D-38] (proceeding to exam). Minor citation inaccuracies (e.g., [D-36] for tests instead of [D-37]), but no hallucinations or fabricated content; content is grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response into bullet points matching each specified element (tests, phys exam, self-iso with source, timeline, criteria), with no off-topic content."
