  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the COPD diagnosis was approximately two years ago, whereas the patient clarifies in [P-2] that it was almost five years ago. Most critically, it claims the transcript does not specify daily smoking consumption, when [P-44] explicitly states the patient currently smokes half a pack a day and previously smoked up to two packs.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to address key parts of the prompt. It misses the specific current consumption level (half a pack) and the history of how it changed over time (reduction from 1-2 packs), both of which were explicitly requested. It also misses the duration of the cough (10 years) and the patient's expressed concern about the link between their smoking and their father's cancer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer includes a false claim about the transcript's contents (stating consumption levels are not specified). This is a hallucination of omission/absence that contradicts the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it addresses the general relationship to COPD, it fails to provide the specific smoking metrics and temporal changes requested in the prompt, focusing instead on a generic summary."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is poor because it explicitly claims information is missing from the transcript (smoking levels) when that information is clearly provided, and it misses the specific details about smoking history requested in the prompt."
