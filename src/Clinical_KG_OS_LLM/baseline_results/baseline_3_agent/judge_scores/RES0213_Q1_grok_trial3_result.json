  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately captures quality as initially 'uncomfortable/odd' but 'sharp strong pain on deep breath'; episodes 20 min intermittent; occurs when alone (walking to school, studying); resolves when with people/talking/hands-on; at rest; not worse with exercise; 1.5 weeks duration; first time; no injury. Generated partially matches quality ('sharp strong') and episode duration (20 min), but errs by omitting deep breath trigger, overall duration, rest/exercise details; significantly misinterprets situations as triggered exclusively by 'anxiety attacks' citing P-20 (which refers to palpitations, not pain) and overemphasizes stress without matching specific situational descriptions in Gold; adds unrequested med relief. Thus, significant factual errors/contradictions warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1.5 weeks overall; quality (uncomfortable to sharp on deep breath); 20 min intermittent episodes; occurs alone/walking/studying; resolves with people/activities; at rest; not worse exercise; no injury/first time. Generated covers: partial quality (sharp/strong), episode duration; misses overall duration, deep breath, specific alone situations vs social resolution, rest/exercise, injury history. Wrongly reframes situations around stress/anxiety. Covers ~20-49% accurately, score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like 'sharp/strong' [P-3,6] grounded; duration [P-6] ok. But 'exclusive to anxiety attacks [P-20]' hallucinates (P-20 about heart flutter/palpitations); attributes pain directly to workload/anxiety attacks/nervousness not directly stated for pain occurrence; 'consistently localized' assumed; resolution as 'context-dependent exclusive to anxiety' fabricated from misread. Multiple hallucinated/misattributed facts, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around quality, duration, occurrence (triggers), resolution as per question; includes med relief as characteristic but minor tangent; no major off-topic content, score 4."
