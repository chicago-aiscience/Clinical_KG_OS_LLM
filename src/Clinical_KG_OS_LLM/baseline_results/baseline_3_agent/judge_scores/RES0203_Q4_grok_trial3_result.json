  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer accurately lists specific negative findings from the review of systems (e.g., no fever [D-10/P-10], no difficulty breathing [D-11/P-11], no headaches, no sore throat, no chills/night sweats, no muscle aches/weakness, no chest pain, no sputum/blood, no cough triggers) with citations, plus PMH negatives, and explains their clinical significance (patient generally well, not acutely unwell). The Generated Answer incorrectly claims negatives like fever/dyspnea/sore throat are not explicitly denied (they are clearly stated as 'no' by patient), focuses on positives (anosmia, ageusia, dry cough) and irrelevant screenings (immunizations, family history), and misstates that responses to those are not explicit (P-20: 'Yes'; P-27: 'No'). It contradicts Gold by ignoring ROS negatives and fabricating reliance on a non-existent 'knowledge graph'. Major factual errors throughout.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: List of 9+ ROS negatives with citations (fever, dyspnea, headache, sore throat, chills/night sweats, muscle aches/weakness, chest pain, sputum/blood, cough triggers), D-16 summary, clinical explanation of absences (not acutely unwell, supports 'generally well'), PMH negatives (no chronic conditions, meds, surgeries, allergies, family hx). Generated covers 0% of these ROS negatives, mentions immunizations/family hx incorrectly as main screenings (minor PMH, not ROS), no citations for actual negatives, no clinical explanation of absences. Covers <20% (only tangential PMH).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated references some transcript parts (e.g., [D-20], [D-27], [P-1], [D-39]) but misrepresents them: claims no explicit patient denials for immunizations/family hx (P-20 'Yes' up-to-date implies no issue; P-27 'No'), asserts no explicit negatives for fever/etc. (directly contradicted by D-10 to D-15, D-22, etc., with 'No' responses), hallucinates 'knowledge graph' linking symptoms (not in provided transcript), fabricates that transcript 'does not explicitly list symptoms like fever, dyspnea' as negatives (it does). Multiple hallucinations and unverifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for specific symptoms/conditions screened and confirmed absent (negative ROS findings), list them, explain how absences (e.g., fever, dyspnea, sore throat) inform clinical picture. Generated ignores negatives, lists positives (anosmia, etc.), minor PMH screenings, explains positives' role in COVID suspicion/self-isolation (opposite of question), dodges absences entirely. Largely off-topic, addresses presence not absence."
