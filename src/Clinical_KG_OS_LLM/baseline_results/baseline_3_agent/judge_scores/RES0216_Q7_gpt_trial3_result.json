  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer has several important inaccuracies:\n- It incorrectly states that the transcript does not say whether symptoms are improving/worsening; the patient clearly says it is “staying the same” and “pretty steady” (P-2, P-3).\n- It implies the patient “continues with their daily walking routine,” but the transcript states his symptoms reduced his usual couple of walks/day to typically one walk/day over the last few days (P-22).\n- It attributes/frames “different than typical asthma symptoms” to D-36; the patient explicitly states it feels different from prior asthma episodes at P-16, while D-36 is clinician interpretation.\nCore elements that are correct: onset ~3 days, tightness (not pain), worse with walking, and inspiratory tightness/harder to breathe are consistent with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered:\n- Started ~3 days prior.\n- Worse with walking/dog walks.\n- Inspiratory component (tightness when breathing in).\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed:\n- First noticed while out on a walk (onset activity) and that nothing in particular triggered it (“just kind of came on”).\n- Explicit course: staying the same/steady.\n- Baseline constancy (“kind of always there”).\n- Other exacerbating situations: getting up out of a chair and taking a big breath in.\n- Functional impact: reduced from a couple walks/day to one; no missed work; overall day-to-day functioning not dramatically impaired but noticeable.\n\nOverall, it captures only a minority of the required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (3-day duration, inspiratory tightness, worse on walks, throat clearing/hoarseness/phlegm). However, there are notable unfaithful elements:\n- The claim that progression is not explicitly stated contradicts P-2/P-3.\n- The description of walking impact is misleading (omits and partially contradicts reduced walking frequency in P-22).\n- The linkage of “different than typical asthma” to D-36 is not well-supported (that sentiment is from P-16).\nThese issues reduce faithfulness but the answer is not largely fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at onset, triggers, evolution, and impact on walking routine, which matches the question. It includes minor extra detail (hoarseness/phlegm) not asked for, but this is limited. Main relevance problem is omission of several asked-for elements (trend, specific exacerbating activities, walking routine reduction)."
