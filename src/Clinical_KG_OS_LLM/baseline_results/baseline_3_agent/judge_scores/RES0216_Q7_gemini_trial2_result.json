  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and contradictions. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not mention if symptoms are getting better, worse, or staying the same, whereas the patient explicitly states they are 'staying the same' [P-2]. It also claims the patient 'continues' his walking routine, neglecting the fact that he reduced his frequency from multiple walks to just one [P-22].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover several key points from the Gold Answer: 1. It misses the specific activity during onset (walking the dog, [P-4]). 2. It misses the specific exacerbating factors of getting out of a chair and taking a deep breath [P-9]. 3. It fails to identify the evolution of symptoms as 'staying the same'. 4. It misses the specific reduction in daily walks (from two to one).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript by claiming that information regarding symptom evolution is absent, which is untrue. It also suggests the patient continues his routine normally, which is not supported by the transcript's mention of reduced frequency.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured according to the prompt's requirements, addressing the categories of onset, symptoms, triggers, and routine, though the content within those categories is inaccurate or incomplete."
