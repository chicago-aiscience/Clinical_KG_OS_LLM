  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses major symptoms like difficulty breathing (explicitly reported in P-7 to P-11 with details on onset, progression, constancy), reduced sense of taste details (timing in P-20, constant in P-21), and fatigue/muscle aches (P-25, P-26). It incorrectly claims no explicit denials for cough (P-15: 'No'), runny nose (P-16: 'No'), headaches (P-17: 'No'), chest pain (P-18: 'nope'), fever (P-23: 'I don't think so'), contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript. Partial coverage of sore throat and taste is accurate but incomplete. Significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: sore throat onset/worsening/swallowing partially (covers ~1 key point); taste minimally (~0.5). Missed entirely: difficulty breathing (full details), fatigue/muscle aches. For negatives, only loss of smell (1/7); misses cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills. Covers ~20-30% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about reported symptoms (sore throat, swallowing, taste) are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, assertion of 'no explicit statements denying cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, or chest pain' is false—direct 'No' responses in P-15,16,17,18,23. This introduces hallucinated absences. Misses verifiable breathing difficulty and other symptoms, but no fabrication of new facts beyond the denial errors. Multiple hallucinated facts re: denials.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses reported symptoms and explicitly denied screened symptoms (cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell), with structure matching question. No off-topic content, though incomplete and erroneous."
