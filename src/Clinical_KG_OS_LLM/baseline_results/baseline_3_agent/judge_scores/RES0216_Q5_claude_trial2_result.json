    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and omissions. While it correctly identifies asthma recurrence as the likely diagnosis, it completely fails to address the core question about medication non-adherence. The answer incorrectly states 'the transcript does not explicitly contain details regarding the patient's specific self-adherence behaviors' when in fact P-19 explicitly documents skipping evening doses and P-17/P-18 document failure to refill rescue inhaler. It also introduces irrelevant content about 'knowledge graph' that appears nowhere in the source materials. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these medication changes as central to the clinical picture.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses approximately 60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It completely omits: (1) the specific medication non-adherence behaviors (skipping evening dose, not refilling rescue inhaler for years), (2) the doctor's explicit summary in D-34 connecting these factors, (3) the specific timeline ('couple of years' without rescue inhaler), (4) the patient's reasoning for medication changes, (5) the complete symptom profile including phlegm and hoarseness, and (6) the clinical significance of lacking rescue medication during symptomatic episodes. It only captures the general concept of asthma recurrence being suspected.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains multiple problematic elements. It introduces '[KG]' citations referring to a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the transcript. While most clinical facts are verifiable, the statement that 'the transcript does not explicitly contain details regarding the patient's specific self-adherence behaviors' is demonstrably false - these details are explicitly stated in P-17, P-18, P-19, and P-20. The numbered breakdown format suggests systematic analysis but misses the most crucial documented facts about medication non-adherence.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer only partially addresses the question. While it discusses the asthma history and current symptoms, it fails to address the core of the question: how the patient's self-directed medication changes (skipping evening doses and not refilling rescue inhaler) relate to current symptoms. The question specifically asks about these medication behaviors, yet the answer dismisses them as not being in the transcript. Approximately 40% of the content is relevant, but it misses the primary focus of the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. Most critically, it incorrectly claims that medication non-adherence details are absent from the transcript when they are explicitly documented in multiple exchanges (P-17, P-18, P-19, P-20, D-34). This represents both a factual error and a failure to address the core question about how medication non-adherence relates to current symptoms. The answer also introduces non-existent 'knowledge graph' citations, raising concerns about faithfulness. While it correctly identifies asthma recurrence as the suspected diagnosis, it misses the crucial causal connection between reduced medication adherence and symptom emergence that forms the heart of both the question and the Gold Answer. The response covers less than 40% of the key clinical points and fundamentally mischaracterizes what information is available in the source material."
