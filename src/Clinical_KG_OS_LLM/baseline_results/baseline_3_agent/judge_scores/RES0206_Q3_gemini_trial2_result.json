  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies the dual assessment correctly but differs from the Gold Answer in how it classifies symptoms. The Gold Answer attributes green-yellow sputum to the respiratory infection (purulence as an infectious trigger), while the Generated Answer attributes it specifically to the COPD exacerbation. It also fails to mention that the doctor plans to use labs/vitals to confirm.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key supporting symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, including sinus pressure, headache, known sick contact, increased cough frequency, increased sputum volume, and decreased exercise tolerance (difficulty walking the dog). It also misses the exclusion of other triggers like environmental exposures.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer repeatedly refers to a 'knowledge graph' as the basis for its associations between symptoms and diagnoses. No such knowledge graph exists in the provided source transcript, making these claims unverifiable and external to the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question regarding symptoms and the distinction between the two diagnoses, even if the content is incomplete compared to the Gold Answer."
