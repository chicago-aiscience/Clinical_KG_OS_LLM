  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the bullseye rash as a clinical feature assessed. It correctly identifies the proposed diagnostic tests (tick ID, blood work, physical exam). However, it suggests the absence of the rash was 'implied', whereas the transcript and Gold Answer show it was explicitly denied by the patient ('I don't see that like larger circle rash'). It also incorrectly attributes blood work to [D-6] when it is only mentioned in [D-18].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key clinical features assessed and found absent: joint pain [D-7], fever/systemic illness [D-8], and headaches [D-19]. It also misses the mention of checking for other bites and the doctor's plan to consult a supervising physician [D-13, D-22]. It only captures one of the four main clinical symptoms discussed.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made are grounded in the transcript. The citation of [D-6] for blood work is slightly inaccurate as blood work is first introduced in [D-18], but the content itself is present in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the two-part question but provides a very limited response to the first part regarding specific clinical features, focusing only on the rash."
