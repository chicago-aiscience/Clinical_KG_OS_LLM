  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly captures the onset of the dry cough at 4-5 days prior and runny nose in the past couple of days, aligning with Gold's timeline and relative timing. However, it omits explicit mention of the cough being dry/non-productive, the severity staying 'the same' (instead vaguely 'persisted without improvement'), and inaccurately frames prior experiences by focusing on past fevers and family asthma rather than the patient's report of never having a dry cough like this and prior runny noses not lasting as long. This introduces significant discrepancies in key details and prior comparison.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: cough onset 4-5 days (P-2), runny nose couple days later (P-11), clear discharge (P-12). Missed: dry/non-productive nature (D-5,P-5,D-6,P-6), severity unchanged (P-7), cough as first/primary symptom, exact progressive pattern (2-3 days after cough), prior dry cough novel and runny noses shorter duration (P-24), novel acute event confirmation (P-28). Covers ~50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: cough 4-5 days (P-2), runny couple days/clear (P-11,P-12), past fevers/no current (P-13), family asthma workup/no SOB (P-28), planned X-ray/COVID swab (D-37,D-39). No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom onset and relative timing/duration of cough vs. runny nose; partially covers severity via persistence; however, misdirects prior experiences comparison to irrelevant fever/family history and adds off-topic planned interventions, diluting focus on the question."
