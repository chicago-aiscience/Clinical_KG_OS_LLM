  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fundamentally fails to address the symptoms the patient 'denied', which was the core requirement of the prompt. Instead, it lists symptoms the patient affirmed (shortness of breath, cough, fever). The Gold Answer correctly identifies the denials (chest pain, fainting, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea, travel, sick contacts, etc.). The Generated Answer's discussion of differentials is based on the positive symptoms rather than the negative findings requested.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost 100% of the key points in the Gold Answer. It does not mention any of the specific negative screens (chest pain, GI symptoms, URI symptoms, or exposures) that the Gold Answer details. It only mentions one denial regarding seizure frequency, which is a minor detail compared to the systematic medical screening for acute dyspnea.",
    "faithfulness": "While the symptoms listed in the Generated Answer (SOB, fever, cough) are present in the transcript, they are categorized incorrectly as 'denied' symptoms or are used to answer a different question. However, the claims made about the transcript contents themselves (the specific symptoms mentioned) are accurate to the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant because it focuses on the patient's positive symptoms and diagnosis rather than the negative findings and how they rule out specific differentials (cardiac, infectious, GI) as requested by the prompt. It essentially answers 'What are the patient's symptoms?' rather than 'What did the patient deny and why?'\", \"scores\": {\"correctness\": 1, \"completeness\": 1, \"faithfulness\": 5, \"relevance\": 2}, \"average_score\": 2.25, \"summary\": \"The Generated Answer fails to address the specific 'denied' symptoms requested by the prompt, focusing instead on the patient's positive symptoms.\""
