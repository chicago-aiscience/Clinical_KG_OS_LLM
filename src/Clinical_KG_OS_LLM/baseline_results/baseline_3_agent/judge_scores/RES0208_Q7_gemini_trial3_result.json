{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms but fails to follow the categorization logic explicitly requested in the prompt. The prompt asks to group the 'loss of taste that morning' under 'more recently,' whereas the Generated Answer places it under 'Symptoms Just Beginning to Emerge.' It also misses the detail about the patient's breathing being 'laborious' rather than an inability to breathe.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key symptoms included in the Gold Answer: generalized body aches (achy), diminished sense of smell (anosmia/hyposmia), and the presence of mild headaches. It covers approximately 60-70% of the symptomatic details provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful to the transcript but includes a minor hallucination by referencing a 'medical knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source text. All symptom descriptions are grounded in the patient's statements.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request to reconstruct the timeline using the three requested phases."
