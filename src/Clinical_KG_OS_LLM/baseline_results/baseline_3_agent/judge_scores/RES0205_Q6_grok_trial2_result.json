  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer regarding the doctor's plan in [D-37], including the specific physical exam components (listen to heart and lungs, quick physical exam) and the process (consult with supervising doctor, review discussion, return to discuss next steps). No factual errors or contradictions; minor omission of contextual details like [D-1] foreshadowing, patient agreement [P-37], and interpretive notes on no diagnosis/meds, but these do not affect core accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: multi-step plan [D-37], physical exam components (heart/lungs auscultation and quick exam), collaborative process (consult supervising physician, review everything, reconvene with patient). Missed: foreshadowing in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], note on no diagnosis/meds or trainee context. Covers ~85-90% of key points, primarily the essential plan details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer directly verifiable in [D-37] of transcript: exact phrasing for physical exam ('quick listen to your heart and lungs' and 'quick physical exam') and process ('go get the doctor that I'm working with', 'go over everything you talked about', 'come back and talk to you about where to go from here'). Accurate citation, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses the question by structuring response around the exact elements asked: physical exam components and process for next steps, with no off-topic content or tangents."
