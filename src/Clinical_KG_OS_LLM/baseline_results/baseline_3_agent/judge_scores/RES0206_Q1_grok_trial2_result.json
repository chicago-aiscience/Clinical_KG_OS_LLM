  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the key respiratory symptoms (increased cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea) matching Gold [P-1], systemic symptoms (feverish feeling [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12]) matching Gold, and most bothersome symptom (cough [P-12]). Minor discrepancies: omits reduced exercise tolerance [P-4] and mild headache [P-14] from Gold's respiratory and systemic lists; paraphrases like 'greenish-yellow' and 'significant shortness of breath' are faithful but slightly interpretive. No contradictions or factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: increased cough frequency [P-1], increased green-yellow sputum [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], dyspnea/hard to breathe [P-1], fever [P-9-11], sinus pressure [P-12], most bothersome cough [P-12] (7/8 positives). Missed: reduced exercise tolerance [P-4], mild headache [P-14]. Pertinent negatives in Gold not covered but not central to reported symptoms. Covers ~85-90% of key reported symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: cough/sputum/hemoptysis/dyspnea [P-1], feverish/hot [P-9], sinus [P-12], cough most bothersome [P-12]. Citations accurate. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; paraphrases grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by categorizing respiratory and systemic symptoms from 3-day worsening and explicitly identifying most bothersome symptom (cough), with no off-topic content."
