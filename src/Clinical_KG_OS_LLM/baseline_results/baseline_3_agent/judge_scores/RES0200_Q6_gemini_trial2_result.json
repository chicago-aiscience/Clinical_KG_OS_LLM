  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns well with the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs), imaging (chest x-ray), and therapeutic interventions (oxygen, steroids, antibiotics, bronchodilators) mentioned by the doctor.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the gold answer: it omits the 24-48 hour timeline for COVID swab results and, more importantly, it misses the instruction for ongoing blood pressure monitoring mentioned in [D-37], which the gold answer included as part of the overall management plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims are supported by the text. The parenthetical note regarding the specific bronchodilators (Ventolin and Spiriva) correctly references [P-11], though it notes the patient identifies them 'later' when it actually occurred earlier in the dialogue; however, the content remains faithful to the transcript's facts.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, focusing entirely on the management plan requested by the prompt without including extraneous information from the history-taking portion of the transcript except where necessary for context (e.g., specific puffer names)."
