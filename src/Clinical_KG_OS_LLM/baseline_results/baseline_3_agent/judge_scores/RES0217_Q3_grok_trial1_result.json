  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the tick attachment duration (>72 hours, citing D-6 and P-1), prior history of bullseye rash (P-3), and exposure history (hiking/gardening from P-1). However, it underemphasizes geographic risk by focusing on activities (hiking/gardening) linked to a non-existent 'knowledge graph' instead of the specific Strathroy location and Lyme map assessment (P-12, D-13) highlighted in Gold. It adds current localized symptoms (red/tender, P-1/P-6) as a key factor, which Gold does not emphasize (doctor finds no rash reassuring, D-7). These are minor discrepancies with core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: exposure history (hiking Fri/gardening Sat, uncertain timing P-1), duration (>72h D-6), geo risk (Strathroy creek P-12, map concerning D-13), prior history (past bite/rash/abx P-3), plus P-5 all-ticks concern, lab send D-6, safer prophylaxis D-18. Generated covers exposure activities, duration, prior history fully; geo partially (activities/environments D-18 but misses Strathroy/map); ignores P-5 and lab; adds symptoms. Covers ~75% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: duration (D-6), prior (P-3), symptoms (P-1/P-6), prophylaxis quote (D-18). Hallucinations include 'knowledge graph' [KG: hiking, gardening] (absent from transcript), 'confirms patient susceptible' (inferential, not direct), 'reacted similarly to previous exposures' (only one prior). Doctor links habitats to ticks (D-18) but no KG. Some unverifiable details, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing combination of risk factors overriding non-deer tick appearance and no current rash; structured around key elements queried; no off-topic content."
