  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient takes an unspecified statin for cholesterol (matches [P-14–P-15]) and that the clinician proposed prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72 hours attachment risk (matches [D-6], reiterated [D-13], [D-18]). It also correctly includes proposed tick identification, possible bloodwork/serology, and a physical exam (all in [D-18]) and the environmental suggestion of insecticide (in [D-18]). Minor issues: it cites [D-5] in support of prophylactic antibiotics (the actual prophylaxis rationale is in [D-6]) and adds an external/unsupported statement about a “medical knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: current statin therapy; new prophylactic antibiotics; tick sent for identification; possible bloodwork; physical exam; insecticide/environmental prevention.\nMissed vs Gold Answer key points: (1) patient denied allergies/no drug allergies ([P-16–P-17]); (2) prior tick bite ~10 years ago treated with antibiotics ([P-3]); (3) plan to consult the supervising physician before finalizing ([D-13], [D-22]); (4) explicitly noting that no specific antibiotic name/dose/duration was given (Gold highlights this). Overall this is partial coverage of the Gold Answer’s items.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate references (statin, prophylactic antibiotics, tick lab ID, serology, exam, insecticide). However, the “medical knowledge graph” remark is not in the transcript and constitutes an ungrounded addition; also the use of [D-5] as a supporting citation for prophylactic antibiotics is not well-grounded (the relevant content is [D-6]).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications and treatments discussed (statin, prophylactic antibiotics, diagnostic steps, and insecticide suggestion), which directly addresses the question. The only minor irrelevance is the added ‘knowledge graph’ comment."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and relevant, capturing the statin and proposed prophylactic antibiotics plus related evaluation steps, but it omits several Gold Answer elements (allergies, prior antibiotics, physician consultation, and noting no specific antibiotic was named) and includes a small ungrounded ‘knowledge graph’ addition."
