  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's summary from [D-47] including cough duration and recent worsening, nighttime symptoms, greenish sputum without blood, and absence of constitutional symptoms, matching Gold's core facts; plan to review story with doctors is identical; minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'some time' vs 'little while/three months') but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: doctor's plan (review story), summary assessment (cough details, no constitutional symptoms), guiding info (patient's story/history); misses Gold's details like explicit lowering concern for TB/malignancy, patient addition [P-47], doctor's 'We'll see' [D-48], no tests ordered, supervising physician role—covers ~85% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from [D-47]: plan verbatim, summary paraphrase accurate (e.g., 'cough...for a little while but...become bad in the last three days...waking up at night...greenish sputum...no blood...no constitutional symptoms'); no unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured response with bullets directly addressing each part of the three-part question (plan, assessment, guiding info); no tangents or off-topic content."
