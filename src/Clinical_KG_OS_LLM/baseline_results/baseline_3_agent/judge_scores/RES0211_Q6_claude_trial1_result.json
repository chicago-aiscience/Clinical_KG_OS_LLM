  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core clinical findings mentioned in D-58 (three-to-four day dry cough, fever, headache) but omits several key details present in the Gold Answer: (1) no sputum production, (2) no recent sick contacts except the brother's cold two weeks ago, (3) no asthma, and (4) not taking medications aside from Claritin. Regarding Jessica's goal, the Generated Answer cites the doctor's framing of 'next steps and where to go from here' but fails to capture Jessica's actual stated goal in P-60: wanting to know 'if I have to like take medicine or something.' This is a significant factual error as it attributes the doctor's summary to Jessica's goal.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the Gold Answer's key points. It captures the main symptoms (cough, fever, headache) but misses five other clinical findings recapped by the doctor. More critically, it misrepresents Jessica's primary goal by quoting the doctor's summary rather than Jessica's own statement in P-60. It also omits Jessica's desire to go home and rest (P-61), which the Gold Answer identifies as reflecting the impact of her symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is grounded in the transcript and accurately cites D-58. However, it misattributes the 'next steps' language to Jessica when this was actually the doctor's framing. Jessica's actual goal statement in P-60 ('I just want to know if I have to like take medicine or something') is not hallucinated content—it exists in the transcript—but the Generated Answer fails to cite it and instead incorrectly presents the doctor's words as Jessica's goal. This represents a faithfulness issue in attribution rather than pure hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about what the doctor recapped and Jessica's goal, making it highly relevant. However, the incomplete coverage and misattribution of Jessica's goal reduce its effectiveness in fully answering the question as posed."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main symptoms recapped by the doctor (dry cough, fever, headache) but omits several key clinical findings mentioned in the Gold Answer. More significantly, it misattributes the doctor's framing of 'next steps' as Jessica's primary goal, when Jessica's actual stated goal in P-60 was to know if she needs to take medicine. The answer is grounded in the transcript but suffers from incomplete coverage and incorrect attribution of Jessica's objectives."
