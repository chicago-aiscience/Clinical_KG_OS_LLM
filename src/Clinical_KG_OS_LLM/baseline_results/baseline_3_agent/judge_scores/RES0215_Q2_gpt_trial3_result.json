  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the child is not taking anything for the current wheeze/SOB episodes (mother: “You don't give her anything for it?…No” [P-34]) and that she only occasionally takes OTC antihistamines such as Reactine for seasonal allergies (“Sometimes she takes like Reactine…over the counter stuff…no prescribed medications” [P-36]; also “Aside from the occasional Reactine…nothing” [P-47]). It also correctly concludes no prescribed medications are part of management.\n\nHowever, it contains a factual error by stating the child is being evaluated for a “viral infection” causing the current wheeze. The transcript does not diagnose the current episode as viral; in fact, there are no infectious symptoms reported (no fever [P-7], no runny nose [P-8], looks well [P-9]). Past episodes over two years were described as viral [P-15], but not the current one. This makes the “current viral infection” statement incorrect relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) no treatment given for current episodes, self-resolve with rest (captured as “no specific medications for this current episode” and implied self-resolution); (2) intermittent OTC Reactine/OTC allergy meds for seasonal allergies; (3) explicit absence of prescribed meds.\n\nKey point missed from Gold Answer: prior infections did not require antibiotics (Gold highlights [P-16])—the Generated Answer does not mention the ‘no antibiotics’ detail. Overall it covers the main medication/treatment history asked in the question but not all supporting medication-related history included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (Reactine/OTC use [P-36], no prescribed meds [P-36], no meds for the episode [P-34], no regular meds [P-47]).\n\nUnfaithful/hallucinated elements: (1) “currently being evaluated for a viral infection” as the cause of the present wheezing is not supported by the transcript; (2) reference to a “knowledge graph” [KG] is not part of the provided transcript and adds an unverifiable justification. These reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses what medications/treatments the child has been taking for the respiratory episodes and any other conditions, and whether prescribed medications have been part of management. Aside from the incorrect ‘viral infection’ framing, it stays on-topic."
