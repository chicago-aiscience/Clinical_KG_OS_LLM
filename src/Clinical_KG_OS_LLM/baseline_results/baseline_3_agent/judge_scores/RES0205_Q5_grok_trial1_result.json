  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links acid reflux to potential incomplete control due to diet-only management and known contribution to cough; Generated aligns closely but adds mechanistic details. For hay fever, Gold explicitly notes no current symptoms or active contribution, while Generated asserts it compounds the cough, introducing a discrepancy. Occupational exposure is similarly framed as risk in both, though Generated emphasizes prevention of resolution slightly differently. Gold's post-viral and anxiety context not covered, representing minor omissions but core relations mostly accurate with some interpretive differences.",
    "completeness": "Covers all three key elements (acid reflux with management details, hay fever history, occupational exposure with PPE) from Gold; includes citations and persistence context. Misses explicit no-medication for reflux, no active hay fever role, post-viral pattern emphasis, and anxiety/distress context, covering ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Citations (P-22, P-25, P-27, P-14, P-17, P-34) accurate and verifiable. Mechanistic claims (e.g., reflux irritating airways, hay fever throat irritation as part of flu symptoms, hospital aerosols) not directly in transcript but medically plausible inferences; hay fever linked to ongoing cough lacks transcript support, as no current allergy symptoms noted.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three specified factors (acid reflux, hay fever, occupational exposure), explaining each relation to persistent cough post-resolution of other symptoms, with no off-topic content."
