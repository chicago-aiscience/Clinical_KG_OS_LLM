  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies that the clinician assessed for erythema migrans/bullseye rash and that it was not present, and it correctly lists the proposed diagnostic steps: physical exam, tick speciation at a lab, and bloodwork/serology (titres). No statements directly contradict the Gold Answer. Minor issue: it frames rash absence as “implied” rather than explicitly denied by the patient, but this does not create a factual error.",
    "completeness": "Misses several clinical features that were assessed and found absent in the Gold Answer: joint pain, fever/systemic illness, headaches, and the explicit confirmation that the patient felt well otherwise. It also omits that the patient checked for and reported no other bites and that the clinician planned to consult a supervising physician before finalizing the plan. It does capture all three proposed diagnostic evaluations (physical exam, tick identification, serology). Overall coverage is well under full (roughly ~40%).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are grounded in the transcript: rash inquiry/absence, local redness/tenderness, sending the tick for identification, ordering serology/titres, and doing a physical exam. No clear hallucinated facts. The ‘definitively exclude or confirm’ phrasing is somewhat stronger than the transcript but still consistent with the intent of proposed evaluation.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question (absent clinical features and proposed diagnostic tests). However, it only partially addresses the ‘specific clinical features’ portion by listing only the rash and not the other screened symptoms, reducing how well it answers the question."

  "summary": "The answer is factually accurate and well-grounded for what it includes (rash and proposed tests), but it is incomplete because it omits multiple absent symptoms the clinician explicitly screened for (joint pain, fever/illness, headaches, etc.)."
