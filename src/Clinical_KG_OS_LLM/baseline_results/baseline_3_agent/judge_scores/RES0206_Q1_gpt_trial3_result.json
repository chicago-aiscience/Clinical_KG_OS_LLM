  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the core respiratory symptoms reported during the 3-day worsening: increased cough frequency, increased green/yellow sputum, small amounts of blood with hard coughing (hemoptysis), and worsened shortness of breath—all consistent with the Gold Answer and supported by the transcript [P-1]. It also correctly lists systemic symptoms of feeling feverish/hot [P-9] and sinus pressure [P-12], and correctly identifies cough as the most bothersome symptom [P-12]. No incorrect symptoms were added.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: increased cough, increased green/yellow sputum, hemoptysis, worsened dyspnea, possible fever, sinus pressure, and cough as most bothersome. Key points missed: reduced exercise tolerance/functional decline (harder to walk dog / around the block) [P-4] and mild headache [P-14]. Pertinent negatives were not included, but they are not required by the question prompt. Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included symptoms are directly supported by the transcript: cough/sputum/hemoptysis/dyspnea [P-1], feverish feeling [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12], and cough as most bothersome [P-12]. No notable hallucinations or unverifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what symptoms occurred during the 3-day worsening and which was most bothersome, with no meaningful tangents."
