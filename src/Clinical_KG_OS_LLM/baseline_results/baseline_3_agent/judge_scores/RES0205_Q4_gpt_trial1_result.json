  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies the ruled-out condition as COVID-19 and that a COVID test was negative (matches P-35).\n- The main factual error is timing: the transcript states the test was done **when symptoms first started** about two weeks ago (P-36). The Generated Answer instead says it was performed “during this 2-week duration…concurrent with the persistence of the cough,” which is not what the patient said and partially contradicts the key timing detail asked in the question.",
    "completeness": "Key elements from the Gold Answer:\n- ✅ Condition ruled out: COVID-19.\n- ✅ Test: COVID test; negative.\n- ⚠️ Timing relative to onset: Gold specifies **at symptom onset (~2 weeks before visit)**; Generated Answer does not include this and replaces it with a vague/incorrect timeframe.\n- ✅ Workplace concern: coworkers afraid when patient coughs; works at a hospital.\n- ❌ Misses additional workplace-related details emphasized in Gold: patient’s PPE use (P-17), staying home awaiting improvement (P-36), and desire/pressure to return to work without coughing (P-36) as part of why the exclusion mattered.\nOverall, it captures some but not all workplace context and misses the key timing precision.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are grounded in the transcript (COVID test/negative; hospital workplace; coworkers scared).\n- However, the timing statement (“performed during this 2-week duration…concurrent with persistence”) is not supported by the transcript and conflicts with P-36.\n- The phrase “high-stakes medical environment” is interpretive (reasonable but not explicitly stated).\nThus, there is some unsupported/inaccurate inference, but not pervasive fabrication.",
    "relevance": "- Directly addresses all requested components: condition ruled out, test used, timing (attempted), and workplace-related concerns.\n- No major tangents; content stays focused on the question."
