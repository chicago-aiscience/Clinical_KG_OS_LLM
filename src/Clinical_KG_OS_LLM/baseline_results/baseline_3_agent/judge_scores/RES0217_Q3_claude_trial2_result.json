  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error in factor #2. It incorrectly claims the doctor acknowledged gardening and outdoor environments in [D-18], when in fact [D-18] is the patient speaking ('Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked.'). The actual discussion about gardening and tick habitats occurs in [D-18] but is a different [D-18] earlier in the conversation. The core facts about >72 hours attachment, geographic risk, and prior history are correct, but the inclusion of 'Current Localized Symptoms' as a key factor is not supported by the Gold Answer, which explicitly states the decision was made 'even though no bullseye rash was currently present.' The local tenderness was not presented as a decision factor in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main factors from the Gold Answer: attachment duration (>72 hours), geographic risk (Strathroy assessment), and prior history of bullseye rash. However, it misses important details: the specific geographic location 'Strathroy along the creek' [P-12], the doctor's consultation of the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map [D-13], the patient's awareness that 'all ticks in this area' are considered possible carriers [P-5], and the plan to send the tick to a lab for species identification [D-6]. The answer adds an extraneous factor (#4 Current Localized Symptoms) that was not part of the Gold Answer's reasoning.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are verifiable in the transcript. The >72 hours calculation, prior bullseye rash history, and local tenderness are all accurately cited. However, the citation [D-18] for the doctor's discussion of tick habitats appears to be a citation error - [D-18] in the provided transcript shows the patient speaking, not the doctor. The knowledge graph references to 'hiking' and 'gardening' are not verifiable in the provided transcript. These are minor but notable hallucinations that reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about what combination of factors led to the antibiotic recommendation. All four factors discussed relate to the decision-making process. However, factor #4 (Current Localized Symptoms) is somewhat tangential, as the question specifically mentions 'no bullseye rash was currently present' - the inclusion of local symptoms as a key decision factor appears to miss this nuance. The answer would be more relevant if it focused exclusively on the three factors that explain why antibiotics were recommended *despite* the absence of visual confirmation."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three main decision factors (attachment duration >72 hours, geographic risk, prior history) but contains factual errors in citations and adds an extraneous factor about local symptoms not present in the Gold Answer. It misses important details like the specific geographic assessment of Strathroy, the distribution map consultation, and the lab identification plan. The citation error for [D-18] and knowledge graph references reduce faithfulness. While mostly relevant, the inclusion of local symptoms as a key factor somewhat misses the question's emphasis on the decision being made despite absence of current bullseye rash."
