  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states onset ~1 week prior and correctly identifies congestion/stuffiness as the first symptom with a shift to predominantly runny nose by the visit (matches [P-2], [P-3]). However, it incorrectly concludes the symptoms were intermittent (“on and off… indicating an intermittent presentation”) and does not incorporate the later clarification that symptoms were “pretty constant for the past week” ([P-8]). Because the question explicitly asks whether symptoms were constant or intermittent, this is a material error.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) ~1 week duration; (2) stuffiness first; (3) predominant symptom shifted to rhinorrhea by visit. Key points missed: (1) the constant-vs-intermittent clarification (initial ‘on and off’ vs later ‘pretty constant’); (2) that symptoms were not improving and prompted the visit ([P-1]); (3) possible influence of OTC decongestant helping a little ([P-10]). Overall coverage is partial (~50–70%).",
    "faithfulness": "Statements about onset, initial stuffiness, and later predominance of runny nose are grounded in the transcript. The claim that ‘on and off’ indicates an intermittent course is not faithful to the full transcript because it omits/contradicts the later direct answer that symptoms were ‘pretty constant’ for the week ([P-8]). This is more than a minor omission because it reverses the overall pattern.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the chronological progression of nasal symptoms and attempts to address onset, first symptom, and symptom evolution. However, it fails to accurately address the required constant vs intermittent element, reducing overall responsiveness."
