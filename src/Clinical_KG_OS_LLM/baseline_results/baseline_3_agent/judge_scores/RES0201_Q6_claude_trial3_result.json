    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the assessment (symptoms in line with COVID-19), both diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), and the isolation instructions including the critical detail about continued isolation if symptomatic even with negative results. The citations are accurate and appropriate.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: the assessment, both diagnostic tests, immediate isolation instructions, and the condition for continued isolation. However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer such as the mention of consulting with the supervising physician, the chest X-ray being ordered to evaluate difficulty breathing in context of COPD, and the patient's acknowledgment of the plan. These are minor omissions that don't affect the core clinical information.",

The answer properly quotes and references specific dialogue turns [D-43] for all key points. No hallucinated content is present, and all statements can be traced back to the source material.",

The structured format with clear headers enhances relevance by organizing the response according to the question's requirements. No irrelevant information is included."
