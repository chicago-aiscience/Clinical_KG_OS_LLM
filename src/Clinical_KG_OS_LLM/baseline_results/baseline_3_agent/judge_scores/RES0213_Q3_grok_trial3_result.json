  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer diagnoses 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain'. Generated Answer diagnoses 'Functional Chest Pain (or Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain) related to Academic Stress', which is factually consistent as functional chest pain often encompasses anxiety/stress-induced non-cardiac pain. Supporting points align: stressors, history of anxiety, somatic symptoms during nervousness, patient attribution all match Gold. Minor discrepancy in terminology ('Functional' vs direct 'anxiety/stress-induced') and omission of situational pattern/negatives, but no contradictions or errors in covered facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Situational pattern (alone vs distracted) [P-4,P-9,P-29]; 2) Anxiety history [P-21,P-22]; 3) Thesis stress [P-13,P-15,P-16]; 4) Nervousness/breathing [P-19]; 5) Patient considers stress [P-8]; 6) Pertinent negatives (fevers, exertional, rest, palpitations, asthma). Generated covers: stressors (3), history (2), somatic/breathing (4), patient attribution (5). Missed: situational pattern (1, emphasized in question) and all pertinent negatives (6). Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: stressors [P-13,P-15], anxiety history [P-21], pain description [P-3,P-6], breathing/nervousness [P-19], patient stress idea [P-8]. Citations accurate to transcript. No hallucinations; somatic symptoms correctly tied to nervousness without fabricating intrinsic SOB (notes 'makes herself nervous'). Diagnosis grounded in transcript details.",
    "relevance": "Directly names diagnosis and lists specific transcript-supported observations with citations, addressing both parts of question (diagnosis + supporting clinical observations). No off-topic content; focused on anxiety/stress link despite question's emphasis."
