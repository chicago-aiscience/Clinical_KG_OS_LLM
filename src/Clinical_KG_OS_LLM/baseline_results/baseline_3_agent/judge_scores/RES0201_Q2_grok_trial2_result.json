  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the long-acting beta agonist for mild COPD with accurate citations [P-28, P-27 implied], and mentions smoking history [P-35] which aligns with Gold. However, it omits vitamins [P-30], no allergies [P-31], and crucially misrepresents self-treatment by claiming 'fluid intake' as a measure attempted [P-2], which is actually a symptom description, not a treatment; true self-treatments are salt water gargling and painkillers [P-6]. Adds hallucinated 'knowledge graph' not in transcript or Gold. Significant factual errors in self-treatment and omissions contradict Gold's details.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: long-acting beta agonist [P-28], vitamins [P-30], only meds confirmed [D-29/D-30], no allergies [P-31], self-treatments (salt water gargle, painkillers, no relief) [P-6], no other therapies, substance use details. Generated covers only beta agonist (~20-25% coverage), misses vitamins, allergies, confirmations, all self-treatments, substitutes incorrect fluid intake, ignores substance use and no other therapies.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on beta agonist and COPD/smoking verifiable [P-27, P-28, P-35]. 'Fluid intake' as self-treatment not verifiable; [P-2] describes symptom tolerance, not attempted treatment—true attempts in [P-6]. 'Knowledge graph' fully hallucinated, not in transcript. Multiple unverifiable/misinterpreted claims and fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around 'Medications and Ongoing Prescriptions' and 'Self-Treatment Measures for Sore Throat,' addressing the question's focus on chronic prescriptions and sore throat self-treatments. Includes minor related detail (smoking) but stays on-topic without off-topic digressions."
