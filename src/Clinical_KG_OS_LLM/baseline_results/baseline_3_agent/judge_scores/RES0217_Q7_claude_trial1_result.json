  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. The timeline (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening, discovery 'earlier today', >72 hour attachment) is correctly stated. The comparison between current and prior episodes is factually accurate, including the bullseye rash in the prior episode, the 'quite swollen' prior tick vs 'pretty small' current tick, and the localized redness without bullseye in the current episode. All facts align with the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major elements from the Gold Answer: (1) Timeline of Friday hiking, Saturday gardening, and discovery timing; (2) Uncertainty about when tick attached; (3) Doctor's 72-hour estimate; (4) Prior episode ~10 years ago with bullseye rash and antibiotics; (5) Comparison of engorgement (prior 'quite swollen' vs current 'pretty small'); (6) Comparison of local symptoms (prior bullseye vs current localized redness). The answer includes the plastic container detail and location behind knee. Coverage is comprehensive at approximately 95% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The timeline details cite [P-1] and [D-6] appropriately. The comparison between episodes cites [P-3], [P-4], and [P-6] correctly. No hallucinated information is present. The answer appropriately uses bracketed citations to ground claims in the source material. One minor issue is the citation [KG] which appears unexplained, but this doesn't constitute significant hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) the timeline from hiking through gardening to discovery and presentation, and (2) the comparison of current vs prior episode symptoms. The answer is well-structured with clear sections for timeline and comparison. No significant off-topic content is present. The answer maintains focus on the specific question components throughout."
