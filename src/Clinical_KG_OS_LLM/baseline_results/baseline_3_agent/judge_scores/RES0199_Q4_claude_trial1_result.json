  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, a swab test as the diagnostic method, 24-48 hours as the turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. All facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: the primary condition (COVID-19), the diagnostic test (swab), the turnaround time (24-48 hours), and the alternative diagnosis (another viral illness). However, it omits some additional details present in the Gold Answer, such as the 14-day isolation instruction, contact tracing for positive results, and supportive management approach. These omissions represent approximately 20-30% of the total key information.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citation [D-52]. The answer properly references the source and does not include any hallucinated information. The claims are grounded in what the doctor explicitly stated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: the condition to rule out, the diagnostic test, the turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis. It is well-focused with no irrelevant information and maintains clear organization that matches the question structure."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and highly relevant response to the clinical question, correctly identifying COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab test as the diagnostic method with 24-48 hour turnaround, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. All information is factually correct and properly grounded in the transcript. The answer loses a point on completeness for omitting supplementary details about isolation period, contact tracing, and management approach that were included in the Gold Answer, but these omissions do not affect the core accuracy of the response."
