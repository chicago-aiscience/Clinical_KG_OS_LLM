  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the initial symptoms (headache and cough four days ago) and stability of cough severity ('around the same'), and accurately notes loss of smell over the last one day (roughly three days after onset). It correctly references GI symptoms starting 'few days back' with details on nausea today and vomiting yesterday. Minor discrepancies include not specifying diarrhea precisely as two days ago (lumping into GI), implying a timeline order where anosmia precedes GI (though 'few days back' is earlier), and describing headache as 'pretty persistent' rather than explicitly 'stayed around the same' in severity; core facts align with Gold and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: initial headache/cough four days ago (100%), anosmia one day ago as latest (100%), cough stable (100%), GI emergence after initial with nausea/vomiting details (~80%, 'few days back' but misses exact diarrhea timing/frequency of two days ago and liquid stools 5-6x/day). Missed: detailed headache characteristics (bilateral forehead/top, 7/10, atypical, explicit stability), cough as dry, vomiting food contents, pertinent negatives (no fever/chills, no respiratory worsening). Covers ~70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations: [P-1] for initial symptoms and GI 'few days back', [P-24] for smell loss over one day, [P-32] for nausea/vomiting timing, [P-11] for cough stability, [P-3] for headache persistence. No hallucinations; interpretations like 'roughly three days after' are verifiable from timeline. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures a timeline addressing the question's requirements: first symptoms (headache/cough), relative timing of GI and loss of smell to initial symptoms, and changes/stability in headache/cough severity. No off-topic content; perfectly focused."
