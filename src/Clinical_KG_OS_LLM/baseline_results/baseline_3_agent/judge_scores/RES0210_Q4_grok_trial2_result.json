  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript contains only patient turns and lacks doctor questions/responses for weight loss [D-22/P-22], travel [D-23/P-23], sick contacts [D-24/P-24], and chemical exposure [D-33/D-34/P-33/P-34], which directly contradicts the provided full transcript and Gold Answer's accurate use of these elements; it vaguely mentions some overlapping differentials (e.g., lung cancer for weight loss, infections for travel/sick contacts, occupational disease for chemicals) but misses key specifics like TB, Legionella/fungal, chemical pneumonitis, and entirely omits how patient responses narrow differentials, adding irrelevant cardiac pathology.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: weight loss screens lung cancer/TB, denial less likely; travel screens endemic/exposure infections (Legionella/fungal), Sarnia/timing noted; sick contacts screens person-to-person/TB, denial reduces exposure likelihood; chemical screens pneumonitis/occupational, limited exposure less likely; collective favors acute infection. Generated covers partial screenings vaguely (~3/5) but misses all response narrowing effects (0/5) and specifics, adds extras; covers 20-49%.",
    "faithfulness": "False claim that transcript lacks doctor questions/responses is a major hallucination (verifiable false via full transcript); differentials partially plausible but not tied to actual context/responses; adds ungrounded cardiac pathology and symptom summary not addressing query; multiple hallucinated facts about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Partially addresses potential screenings per question but ignores patient's responses' role in narrowing differentials (core query element), includes off-topic symptom summary and broad differentials like cardiac pathology."
