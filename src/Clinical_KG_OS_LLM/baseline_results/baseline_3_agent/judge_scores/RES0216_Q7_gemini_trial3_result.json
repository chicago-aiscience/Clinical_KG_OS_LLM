  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error by stating that the transcript does not mention whether the symptoms are getting better, worse, or staying the same; in [P-2], the patient explicitly states they are 'staying the same.' It also inaccurately implies the daily walking routine is unchanged ('continues with their daily walking routine'), whereas [P-22] notes the frequency was reduced from twice to once per day. Core facts about the duration (three days) and the general trigger (walking) are correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer and transcript: it fails to provide the symptom progression (staying the same), misses specific exacerbating factors (getting up from a chair, taking a big breath), and omits the specific impact on the walking routine (reduction in frequency). It covers approximately 40% of the requested information.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer 'hallucinates' the absence of information regarding the symptom trend. By claiming the transcript does not explicitly state the evolution of symptoms, it ignores direct dialogue in [P-2] and [P-3]. The rest of the claims are grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to address each component of the multi-part question (Onset, Nature, Triggers, Trend, Impact), though the content within those sections is often incorrect or incomplete."
