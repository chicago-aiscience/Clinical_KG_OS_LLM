  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer is partly consistent with the Gold Answer but contains a major factual error about sleep disruption. Gold: nocturnal awakenings began about 1 month ago and occurred pretty well every night (P-19, P-21). Generated answer incorrectly states the cough started waking her at night in the last 3 days and attributes this to D-47, which does not support that timing. Other elements (3-month onset; productive greenish sputum in past few days/~3 days; subjective fevers in past couple of days) are broadly correct though less precise than Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold elements covered: (1) cough began ~3 months ago; (2) became productive with greenish sputum ~3 days/past few days; (3) subjective fevers past couple days. Missing/incorrect: (a) the initial onset context during pole dancing class; (b) the explicit characterization that it was dry and intermittent for ~2 months; (c) the crucial detail that sleep disruption started ~1 month ago and was pretty well nightly, and that it was not present for all 3 months. Overall coverage is moderate but with an important timeline component wrong.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (P-2, P-9, P-4). However, the claim that sleep disruption began in the last 3 days is not supported by the transcript and conflicts with P-19/P-21; D-47 is used as a citation but does not specify that timing. This is a notable ungrounded/misattributed detail.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested cough timeline elements (onset, sleep disruption, productive sputum, fevers) with minimal extraneous material. Despite the sleep-disruption error, it directly addresses the question."
