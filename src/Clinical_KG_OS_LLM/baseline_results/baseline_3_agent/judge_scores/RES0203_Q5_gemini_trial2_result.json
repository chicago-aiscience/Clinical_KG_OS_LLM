  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the primary question. It claims the patient 'did not explicitly identify a specific exposure event,' whereas the transcript (P-18) and Gold Answer clearly state the patient identified a hiking trip where people brushed by them. This is a direct contradiction of the source material.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the hiking trip, the location, the specific detail of people 'brushing by,' the high school/online class context, and the patient's own conclusion that this was the only possible source of infection. It only covers the symptoms and the fact that a COVID test was ordered.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that there was no exposure event mentioned in the segments. Furthermore, it refers to a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source transcript, suggesting it is bringing in external or hallucinated context rather than relying on the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is only partially relevant. While it explains why COVID-19 was suspected (symptoms), it completely fails to address the first half of the prompt regarding the 'specific potential exposure event' and how 'this exposure history' (rather than symptoms) connects to the diagnosis."

  "summary": "The generated answer fails significantly by incorrectly claiming no exposure event was identified, thereby ignoring the patient's explicit mention of a hiking trip and missing the core requirement of the prompt."
