  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies asthma as the respiratory condition, the grandparents as the source of family history, and the specific negative findings (shortness of breath and wheezing) cited by the mother. This is perfectly consistent with the gold answer and the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key components of the question: the condition (asthma), the specific family history (grandparents), and the negative clinical findings (no shortness of breath or wheezing, even during activity). It omits some of the auxiliary context found in the gold answer (such as the mention of a 'work up' or the patient's previous health), but it captures all points explicitly requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically turn [P-28], where the mother discusses the grandparents' asthma and the patient's lack of symptoms during physical activity.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and focused, addressing the multi-part question without including unnecessary tangents. It specifically adheres to the prompt's focus on findings cited by the mother."
