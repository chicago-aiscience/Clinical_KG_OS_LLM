  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies the correct symptoms (decreased smell, loss of taste, mild dry cough) consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. However, it inaccurately represents taste loss as complete by solely quoting P-1 ('lost my sense of taste') without incorporating the Gold Answer's key detail of partial loss (can taste very salty foods, not banana from P-4). For smell, it correctly notes reduction/not complete but omits specific details (can smell really bad odors). Cough is basic but misses Gold's details like non-productive, same onset, no worsening, no triggers. Duration of two days omitted. Minor to significant discrepancies, core symptoms correct but degrees/details erroneous.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3 symptoms for 2 days; smell partial (really bad odors); taste partial (salty yes, banana no); both consistent; cough mild/dry/non-productive/same time/consistent/no triggers. Generated covers: symptoms; smell reduced/not complete (vaguely ~50% of smell point); taste affected (no partial/details); cough mild dry consistent (~40%). Misses duration, smell/taste specifics, sensory consistency, cough onset/non-productive/no triggers. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: smell/taste/cough from P-1; cough consistent from P-8. Citations accurate. Inference of smell as 'reduction rather than complete' grounded in P-1 phrasing and supported by P-4 (though not cited). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly lists sensory (smell, taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms with some degree info (e.g., smell reduction) and perceptions, using bullets for clarity. No off-topic content; perfectly addresses question focus."
