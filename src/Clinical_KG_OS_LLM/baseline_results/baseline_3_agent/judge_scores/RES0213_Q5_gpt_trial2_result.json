  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core idea from the Gold Answer: the patient’s cardiac worry is influenced by (1) father’s heart attack in his 50s, (2) her smoking and difficulty quitting, and (3) major thesis-related stress, with anxiety/physiologic arousal during episodes. However, it introduces several statements not supported by the Gold Answer/transcript framing, such as “genetic predisposition” as a stated driver, smoking being a “direct physiological risk factor for the chest pain he is experiencing,” and a Knowledge Graph asserting causal links (e.g., stress → chest pain) as if established facts. It also repeatedly misgenders the patient (he/his), which is incorrect given the question and context.",
    "completeness": "It covers the three requested domains and gives examples for each: father’s MI in his 50s and patient being scared/worried it’s a “heart thing” (matches [P-8]); smoking ~5 cigarettes/day and difficulty quitting (matches [P-13–P-14]); thesis/time-crunch stress (matches [P-15–P-16]) and nervousness/rapid breathing (matches [P-19]). Key Gold Answer details are missing: (a) father’s MI was “last year” and he now sees “a lot of heart doctors” [P-8, P-30]; (b) broader family history uncertainty (paternal grandfather died in an accident; cardiac history unknown) [P-30]; (c) full smoking timeline (started ~18; up to ~10/day for two years; cut down by half) [P-18]; (d) social isolation/living alone and not seeing many people [P-26–P-27]; (e) anxiety attack history and concern it may be returning [P-22]; (f) being nervous to run lately [P-28]. Overall, it includes the main pillars but omits multiple illustrative consultation details emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Several parts are grounded in the transcript with appropriate pointers (father’s MI and fear [P-8], thesis stress [P-15–P-16], rapid breathing when nervous [P-19], smoking reduction/trying to quit [P-13–P-14]). However, it adds non-transcript elements (“Knowledge Graph” relationships; definitive causal claims like stress → chest pain; smoking as a risk factor for the current chest pain) and some interpretive overreach (“most significant driver”). These reduce grounding, though the overall narrative remains broadly plausible.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with her heart-disease concern, and it uses consultation details to illustrate these links. Minor tangents (Knowledge Graph commentary) and some generalized biomedical assertions detract slightly but it remains mostly on target."
