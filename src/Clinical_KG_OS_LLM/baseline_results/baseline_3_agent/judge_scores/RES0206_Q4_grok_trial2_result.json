  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as COVID [D-43] and the test as COVID swab [D-43], matching the Gold Answer. However, it makes a significant factual error by claiming 'the provided transcript does not contain any details regarding the patient's recent social contacts,' which directly contradicts the transcript [P-20, D-20, D-21, P-21] and the detailed social contact information in the Gold Answer. This misrepresents key prompting evidence.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) condition COVID-19, (2) test COVID swab [D-43], (3) social contacts prompting diagnosis (friends walking dogs, one sick, walked too close [P-20], unsure if friend tested [P-21]), plus symptom screening. Generated covers (1) and (2) partially but completely misses (3), claiming no such details exist; covers approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Condition and test claims are accurately grounded in [D-43]. However, the assertion that the transcript lacks social contact details is a hallucination, as [D-20/P-20/D-21/P-21] explicitly describe the patient's exposure to a sick friend during dog walks. Attributing consideration solely to symptoms introduces unverifiable causation not precisely matching the transcript's sequence.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to directly address the three-part question (condition, test, social contacts) with no off-topic content or tangents, perfectly focusing on the query."
