  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53], matching the Gold Answer. For rationale, it correctly notes the husband's symptoms and uses the key quote from [D-53] about prioritizing COVID, but shifts emphasis to symptoms [P-1] rather than purely epidemiological context, and omits self-isolation details; minor discrepancies as core facts align without major errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers: test ordered (COVID swab [D-53]); prioritization due to husband [P-19 implied] and quote [D-53]. Misses: explicit household transmission as primary epi driver; self-isolation instruction [D-53, D-54]; sequence of mentioning influenza after flu shot question [P-53, D-54]. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about test, symptoms [P-1], and quotes [D-53] are verifiable in transcript. However, multiple references to a 'Knowledge Graph' (confirming test, linking symptoms to COVID) are not present in the transcript, representing hallucinated content. Inference of infection via husband is plausible but not directly stated.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question (test and rationale for prioritizing COVID over influenza) with structured response and no off-topic content."
