  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the bullseye rash as a feature assessed and found absent, and correctly lists the proposed diagnostic tests (tick species identification, blood work/serology, and physical exam) as found in the transcript and gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is incomplete regarding the clinical features. While it mentions the bullseye rash, it misses several other specific features assessed by the doctor and found absent: joint pain (D-7), fever/systemic illness (D-8), and headaches (D-19). It also omits the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician, which was part of the proposed process in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. The citations for the bullseye rash, tick identification, blood work, and physical exam are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: clinical features assessed/found absent and diagnostic tests proposed."
