  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core elements of the plan in the Gold Answer: (1) physical exam, (2) sending the tick for species ID, (3) Lyme-related bloodwork/serology, (4) prophylactic antibiotics given likely >72h attachment, (5) clinician will speak with/consult another physician, and (6) prevention advice about tick habitats and using insecticide. Minor inaccuracies: it cites [D-5] for tick lab identification and antibiotics timing, but those plans are stated at [D-6] and [D-18] (and antibiotics at [D-13]/[D-6]). It also adds “immediately” and calls the other doctor a “specialist,” neither of which is stated. Overall, the clinical content is largely correct with small wording/citation errors.",
    "completeness": "Includes all key components from the Gold Answer: quick physical exam, tick sent to lab for species identification, Lyme titres/serology bloodwork, prophylactic antibiotics, plan to talk to the physician, and preventive garden/outdoor advice including long grass/wood-field edges and insecticide. Minor omissions: it does not mention the geographic risk rationale (Strathroy/distribution map) that supported antibiotic decision, and it does not reflect the trainee/attending-supervision nuance described in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (physical exam, tick lab ID, bloodwork, antibiotics, tick habitat/insecticide, and plan to talk to another doctor). However, there are minor ungrounded embellishments (e.g., describing the consulted physician as a “specialist,” and implying the physical exam will “confirm the risk of Lyme disease”), and some citations are incorrect (using [D-5] where the relevant statements are in [D-6]/[D-13]/[D-18]). These are limited and do not fundamentally change the plan.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing proposed diagnostic tests, treatment, physician consultation plan, and preventive advice about the garden/outdoor environment, with no significant irrelevant content."
