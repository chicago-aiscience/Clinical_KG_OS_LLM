  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the child only uses occasional OTC antihistamines (Reactine/“over the counter stuff”) for seasonal allergies and that no prescribed medications are part of her management, consistent with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces an inaccuracy by stating the child is “currently being evaluated for a viral infection” causing the wheeze. The transcript does not establish a current viral infection (no fever/runny nose/sick contacts; past infections were viral). This is a factual overreach compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) no medications given for the current wheezy/SOB episodes; (2) intermittent OTC Reactine/antihistamines for seasonal allergies; (3) explicitly no prescribed/regular medications. Missed: the Gold Answer’s additional point that prior infections did not require antibiotics. Overall, it covers the core medication/treatment history asked in the question but not every supporting detail included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims about Reactine/OTC use and lack of prescriptions are grounded in the transcript. But the answer adds non-transcript content: reference to a “knowledge graph” and the assertion of a current “viral infection.” These reduce grounding and introduce hallucinated/unverifiable elements.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on medications/treatments and whether prescriptions were involved, which directly answers the question. The added discussion implying a current viral infection is a minor tangent but does not dominate the answer."
