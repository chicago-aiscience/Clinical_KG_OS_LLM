  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the patient's current statin therapy for cholesterol (matching Gold [P-14][P-15]) and the proposed prophylactic antibiotics due to tick attachment duration >72 hours (Gold [D-6][D-13][D-18]), including diagnostics like tick lab and blood work. Minor discrepancies include omitting past antibiotic history [P-3] and allergies [P-16][P-17], inaccurate citations (e.g., [D-5] not about duration), and a hallucinated external reference to 'medical knowledge graph [KG]' not in Gold or transcript. Core facts remain consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: current statin (100%), prophylactic antibiotics proposal with rationale (100%), tick lab [D-6][D-18], blood work [D-18], insecticide [D-18], physician consult [D-13][D-22]. Misses past tick bite antibiotics [P-3] (~10-20% of content) and allergies (~10%). Covers ~85-90% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: statin [P-14][P-15], prophylactic [D-6][D-18][D-13], tick lab [D-6][D-18], blood/serology [D-18], physical exam [D-18], insecticide [D-18]. Minor issues: [D-5] mis-cited (deer tick ID, not duration/prophylaxis), single hallucination of 'medical knowledge graph [KG]' (unverifiable external). No multiple fabrications; mostly grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around question's focus: statin therapy (section 1), prophylactic antibiotics (section 2), and relevant diagnostics/treatments (section 3) discussed for tick bite. No off-topic content; perfectly addresses medications/treatments including specified elements."
