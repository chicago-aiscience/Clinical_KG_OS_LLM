  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate compared to the Gold Answer: it correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and all listed supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, rest, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/anseads for aches). Minor note: retains transcript's 'anseads' (matching Gold's interpretation as NSAIDs), no contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnostic test and timing (yes), isolation duration (yes), contact tracing conditions (yes), all supportive care (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fevers, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches - yes). Missed: explicit alternative diagnosis (another viral illness if negative) and statement on no prescription medications beyond supportive. Covers ~90% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] of transcript with accurate citations; supportive care quotes match exactly (e.g., 'well hydrated,' 'nutritious food,' etc.); minor unverifiable addition of 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript or prompt), but no fabricated facts about plan.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around exact elements requested (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care) with no off-topic content."
