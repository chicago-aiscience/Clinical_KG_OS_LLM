  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding the symptoms it does list (red spots in sputum, right-sided chest pain, fever, and chills). It does not contain any inaccuracies compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention the 'yellow custard' color of the sputum (which was explicitly requested), the 'dull' and 'constant' quality of the chest pain, and additional symptoms like dyspnea on exertion, a sore throat, and a recent runny nose. It covers approximately 40% of the total symptom data provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and correspond to specific speaker turns (P-4, P-17, P-19, P-5, P-9). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and follows the requested structure. However, it fails to fully answer the prompt's specific requirement for the 'color' of the sputum (omitting yellow) and the 'quality' of the chest pain (omitting dull/constant), although it provides location and aggravating factors."
