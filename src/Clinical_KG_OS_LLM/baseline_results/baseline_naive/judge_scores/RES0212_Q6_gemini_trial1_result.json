  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is entirely incorrect. It claims that the provided transcript does not include the doctor's dialogue (D-X) and only goes up to P-23, when in fact the provided source transcript includes the full dialogue up to D-48 and P-48. Consequently, it fails to identify the doctor's summary assessment and plan found in D-47.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer missed 100% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It did not mention the doctor's plan to review with other doctors, the summary of the three-month cough, the absence of constitutional symptoms, or the role of the supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the provided source material. It falsely claims the transcript is missing data that is clearly present in the prompt. This is a significant hallucination regarding the structure and content of the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer fails to address the question entirely, stating it is 'not possible' to do so based on a false premise about the input data."
