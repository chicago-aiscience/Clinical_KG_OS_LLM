  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness behind left knee) but makes a critical error regarding systemic symptoms. It incorrectly states that the doctor screened for 'drug allergies' as a systemic symptom and claims the doctor did NOT screen for fever, joint pain, or headaches. However, the transcript clearly shows the doctor asked about joint pain [D-7/P-7], fever/feeling ill [D-8/P-8], and headaches [D-19/P-19-20], all of which were denied by the patient. The Generated Answer contradicts the Gold Answer on this key component.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50% of the required information. It adequately describes the local symptoms at the bite site, including location, redness, tenderness, and soreness. However, it completely fails to identify the correct systemic symptoms that were screened for (fever, joint pain, headaches) and instead provides incorrect information about drug allergies. It misses the patient's explicit denials of these systemic symptoms and the doctor's screening questions.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer shows poor faithfulness to the source transcript. While it accurately cites some local symptoms from [P-1], it makes a major error by claiming the transcript does not contain evidence of screening for fever, joint pain, or headaches when these exchanges are clearly present in [D-7/P-7], [D-8/P-8], and [D-19/P-19-20]. The statement about screening for 'drug allergies' as a systemic symptom appears to be a misinterpretation of [D-16/D-17], which was about medication allergies, not systemic symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. It correctly addresses the first part of the question about local symptoms at the bite site. However, it fails to properly address the second part regarding systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, headaches) that were screened for and denied. Instead, it provides irrelevant information about drug allergies and incorrectly claims the screening questions were not present in the transcript."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies local symptoms at the tick bite site but fails significantly on the systemic symptoms component. It incorrectly claims that fever, joint pain, and headaches screening are not in the transcript when they clearly are ([D-7/P-7], [D-8/P-8], [D-19/P-19-20]). The misidentification of drug allergy screening as a systemic symptom demonstrates confusion about what constitutes systemic symptoms versus patient history taking. This represents a major factual error that contradicts the source material and Gold Answer."
