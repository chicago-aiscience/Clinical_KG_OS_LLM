  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the tick attachment duration estimation based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening, matching the Gold Answer's citations [P-1, D-2, D-6] and reasoning for >72 hours leading to prophylaxis. However, it incorrectly claims no information on 'Strathroy' or the 'Ontario Lyme disease distribution map' in the transcript (falsely citing [D-5], [D-6], [D-17]), contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence [P-12, D-13] where Strathroy is specified and the map justifies concern. It also misstates that justification rests 'entirely' on timeline, ignoring geographic risk. Significant contradictions on the second half of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: patient activities Fri/Sat [P-1], doctor's >72h calculation [D-6], prophylaxis due to duration. Missed entirely: uncertainty of attachment timing [P-1], time since last outdoors [D-2], Strathroy location [P-12], Lyme map reference and 'concerning point' assessment [D-13], combined justification for antibiotics [D-13]. Covers ~50% of Gold Answer key points (duration part fully, geographic part 0%).",
    "faithfulness": "Duration claims verifiable: [P-1, D-6] accurately quoted/cited. Geographic claims not grounded—hallucinates absence of Strathroy/map despite clear transcript evidence [P-12, D-13]; references non-existent 'knowledge graph' and irrelevant [D-5/17]; incorrectly asserts timeline is sole justification when [D-13] adds map. Multiple hallucinated absences/misattributions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses first part of question (duration from hiking/gardening) with focus. Partially addresses second by denying map/Strathroy role and redirecting to timeline only, introducing off-topic denial and 'knowledge graph' mention instead of engaging the query fully."
