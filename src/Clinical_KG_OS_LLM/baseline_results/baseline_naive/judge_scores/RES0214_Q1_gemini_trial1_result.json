  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) and the five denied symptoms (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing). However, it fails the second part of the prompt which asks for symptoms she 'explicitly denied when the doctor asked.' The Generated Answer incorrectly claims she denied them by omission in her first statement [P-1]. In reality, she explicitly denied them later in the transcript (e.g., [P-5], [P-8], [P-10], etc.) when the doctor specifically inquired about them.",
    "completeness": "The answer is complete in terms of listing all the symptoms requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer's claim that the patient 'effectively denied' symptoms by not reporting them in [P-1] is a misinterpretation of the transcript. Furthermore, citing [P-1] as the source for the denied symptoms is factually incorrect as those denials do not occur in that turn; the transcript contains actual explicit denials in later turns which the Generated Answer ignored.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question asked, identifying both the reported and denied symptoms."
