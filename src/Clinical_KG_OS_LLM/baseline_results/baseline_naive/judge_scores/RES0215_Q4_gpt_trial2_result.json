  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly links fever/runny nose/phlegm questions to screening for infectious vs reactive/allergic etiologies (consistent with the Gold Answer). However, it contains major factual errors: it explicitly claims the transcript does not contain questions about sick contacts, recent travel, or rashes, when these are clearly present ([D-10], [D-11], [D-13]). It also incorrectly implies a “recurring respiratory pattern,” despite the parent stating the child has never had anything like this before ([P-4]). These inaccuracies substantially reduce factual alignment with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) fever → infectious causes (pneumonia/bronchitis) + patient denied; (2) runny nose → URI/viral-induced wheeze + denied; (3) sick contacts → contagious infection + denied; (4) travel → exposure-related infection + no travel; (5) rash → systemic/allergic/viral exanthem + denied; (6) phlegm → productive infectious process vs dry/reactive + denied; (7) pain → pleuritic/MSK + denied; (8) looks fine otherwise; (9) no recent antibiotics.\nGenerated answer covers (1) conceptually but does not clearly state the patient’s denial; covers (2) conceptually but again not clearly with the denial; covers (6) with denial; does not cover (3)-(5) and (7)-(9). Overall, it includes <50% of the Gold Answer’s key screening targets and responses.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “knowledge graph,” the assertion that the transcript lacks sick contacts/travel/rash questions, and the suggestion of a recurring pattern of respiratory issues. While some inferences (infection vs asthma) are reasonable, multiple claims directly conflict with or extend beyond the transcript, lowering faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at the asked question (what conditions were being screened for and how responses narrowed the differential), but it omits multiple asked-about domains (sick contacts, travel, rashes) and includes irrelevant/meta content (“knowledge graph”). It is only partially responsive to the full scope of the question."
