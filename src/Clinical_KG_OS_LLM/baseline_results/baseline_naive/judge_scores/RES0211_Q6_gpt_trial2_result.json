  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely inconsistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript’s end-of-visit summary (D-58/P-60/P-61). The doctor’s recap in D-58 included: 3–4 days of dry cough, “a little bit of fever,” some headache, no sputum production, minimal sick contacts except brother with a cold ~2 weeks ago, no asthma, and no meds besides Claritin—none of which are accurately or fully represented. The Generated Answer incorrectly adds/overemphasizes “night sweats” as a confirmed key finding and incorrectly asserts the doctor was confirming a “diagnosis of a common cold.” It also misstates Jessica’s primary goal: she explicitly said she wanted to know if she needed medicine (P-60), not that she wanted to end the appointment without questions (and it misuses P-59, which is not her “no more questions” statement).",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer mostly missing: (1) 3–4 day dry cough (missing), (2) no sputum (missing), (3) sick contact exception: brother cold 2 weeks ago (missing), (4) no asthma (missing), (5) only Claritin (missing), (6) visit purpose = next steps (not captured accurately), (7) Jessica’s stated next-step goal = whether she needs medicine (missed/contradicted), (8) desire to go home and lay down (missed). Only partial overlap is mention of headache/fever, but even those are not presented as the doctor’s end summary findings in the way asked.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “knowledge graph,” that the doctor was confirming a “diagnosis of a common cold,” and that “night sweats” were confirmed as a key finding in the doctor’s recap. The citations/turn references are also misapplied (e.g., stating Jessica’s goal was to have no further questions and citing P-59, when P-60 contains her goal about medication).",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to address both parts of the question (doctor recap + Jessica’s goal), but it focuses on the wrong content (a supposed cold diagnosis, night sweats) and gives an incorrect goal. So it is only partially aligned with the question’s intent."
