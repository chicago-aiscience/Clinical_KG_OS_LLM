  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer integrates all four specified factors (seasonal allergies, recurrent viral infections, new carpets, cold weather sensitivity) into an atopic and environmental profile leading to hyperresponsive airways and exercise-induced symptoms, citing transcript accurately. The Generated Answer correctly covers allergies [P-35,36], virals [P-15], and cold weather [P-38], but incorrectly states new carpets are not mentioned (they are in [P-54]), excludes them, adds unsubstantiated 'respiratory trauma' and 'knowledge graph' references not in Gold or transcript, and omits other environmental assessments and full collective atopic asthma framing. This introduces significant contradictions and errors vs. Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: atopic from allergies [P-35,36]; virals trigger inflammation [P-15,16]; new carpets as irritant [P-54]; cold as trigger [P-38]; other env factors (no smoke [P-53], pets [P-55], wood [P-56], filters [P-57]); exercise [P-3,41] and rest resolution [P-6]; overall hyperresponsiveness. Generated covers allergies, virals, cold, exercise partially (~60-70%), but fully misses carpets, other env factors, rest resolution, and detailed atopic link, so 50-79% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on symptoms, allergies [P-35,36], virals [P-15], cold [P-38], exercise [P-3] verifiable. However, explicitly hallucinates absence of new carpets ([P-54] states 'new carpets... six months ago'); 'knowledge graph explicitly links' not in transcript; 'respiratory trauma' interpretive stretch not grounded. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses collective relation of listed factors (minus carpets) to exercise-induced wheezing/distress via hyperreactivity; includes relevant symptoms and triggers; minor tangent in 'missing info' note, but focused on question."
