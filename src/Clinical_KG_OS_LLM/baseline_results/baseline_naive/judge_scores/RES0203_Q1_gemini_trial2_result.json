  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states that the patient 'completely lost' their sense of taste. While the patient initially says this in [P-1], they clarify in [P-4] that it is partial, as they can still taste 'really, really salty foods.' The gold answer correctly identifies both sensory losses as partial.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to include the specific details requested in the prompt regarding what the patient could and could not perceive (e.g., ability to smell 'really really bad' odors, inability to taste bananas, ability to taste salty foods). It also misses the duration (two days) and the consistency of the symptoms mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is grounded in the transcript, but it relies exclusively on the initial statement in [P-1] and ignores the clarifying details provided in [P-4]. This leads to an inaccurate representation of the patient's actual clinical status as described later in the conversation.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the three main symptoms but fails to follow the prompt's instruction to 'Include any details the patient provided about what they could and could not still perceive.' This makes it only partially relevant to the full scope of the question."
