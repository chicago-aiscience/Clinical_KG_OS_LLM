  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly identifies the doctor's recap in D-58, omitting key elements like 'dry cough for 3-4 days' and 'no sputum production.' It falsely claims the doctor confirmed 'fever/running temperature' and 'night sweats' as key clinical findings in the recap, when D-58 only mentions 'a little bit of fever.' Most critically, it completely misidentifies Jessica's primary goal, stating she wanted 'to conclude the appointment without further inquiries' based on P-59, when the actual goal was stated in P-60: wanting to know 'if I have to like take medicine or something.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the Gold Answer's key points. It fails to mention: (1) the 3-4 day duration; (2) dry cough specifically; (3) not bringing anything up; (4) brother's cold two weeks ago; (5) no asthma; (6) not taking medications aside from Claritin; (7) the actual primary goal about medication; (8) the desire to go home and lay down; (9) the impact of malaise and fatigue. It only vaguely touches on some symptoms but misrepresents them.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple hallucinated claims not supported by the transcript. It claims the doctor 'confirmed' night sweats as a key clinical finding in the recap (D-58), but D-58 makes no mention of night sweats. It references a 'knowledge graph' that doesn't exist in the provided materials. It misattributes Jessica's response in P-59 (answering 'No' to drug injection question) as her answer about having more questions. The actual response about no more questions is in P-61, and her primary goal was stated in P-60, which is completely ignored.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address both parts of the question (doctor's recap and Jessica's goal) but does so with largely incorrect information. While it maintains the structure of addressing both components, the content is largely off-target, misidentifying key clinical findings and completely missing Jessica's actual stated goal about medication. It introduces irrelevant elements like a 'knowledge graph' and provides incorrect turn references."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates critical failures across all evaluation dimensions. It fundamentally misidentifies the key clinical findings from the doctor's recap in D-58, omitting the dry cough and other essential elements while incorrectly emphasizing symptoms not mentioned in that summary. Most significantly, it completely misses Jessica's primary goal stated in P-60 about wanting to know if she needs medication, instead incorrectly claiming she just wanted to end the appointment. The answer contains hallucinated references to a non-existent 'knowledge graph' and multiple factual errors regarding what was actually discussed in the doctor's summary. It covers less than 20% of the Gold Answer's key points and demonstrates poor faithfulness to the source transcript."
