  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and accurately describes the cough as dry and non-productive, matching the Gold Answer's core facts from [D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6]. For the runny nose, it notes that characteristics (consistency and color) were assessed per [D-11, D-12], which aligns with the transcript but omits the patient's specific report of 'pretty clear' discharge; no factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer, only minor omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: cough as dry/non-productive (yes); runny nose reported (yes). Missed: cough duration (4-5 days), cough stability (stayed the same), runny nose duration (couple days), nasal discharge specifically 'pretty clear', patient's history note [P-24], pertinent negatives (no sore throat, chest pain, SOB/wheeze). Covers main symptoms and cough characteristics (~60% of key points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: dry cough confirmed [D-5, P-5]; non-productive nature supported by context [D-6, P-6]; runny nose [D-11, P-11]; assessment of nasal discharge consistency/color directly from [D-12]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing specific symptoms (cough, runny nose) reported by patient and their characteristics (dry/non-productive cough; assessment of nasal discharge appearance/consistency), with no off-topic content."
