  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims it is 'not possible' to answer the question because the provided transcript segments 'consist exclusively of patient statements' and don't include doctor turns. This is factually incorrect - the Source Transcript clearly includes multiple doctor statements labeled [D-1] through [D-38], including the critical [D-37] that directly addresses the question. The Generated Answer fundamentally misrepresents the available information and fails to identify the correct answer present in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) the physical examination components (heart and lungs auscultation, quick physical exam), (2) the collaborative consultation process with the supervising physician, (3) the plan to return and discuss next steps, and (4) the foreshadowing in [D-1]. Instead, it incorrectly claims the information is unavailable and provides irrelevant details about dietary modification and COVID testing.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript consists 'exclusively of patient statements' when doctor statements [D-1] through [D-38] are clearly present and labeled. While the two points mentioned (dietary modification and COVID testing) are accurate from the transcript, they are irrelevant to the question asked. The claim that the answer is 'not possible' is a hallucination contradicted by the transcript itself.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant to the question. Instead of addressing the doctor's stated plan, physical examination components, and process for next steps (all clearly present in [D-37] and [D-1]), it incorrectly claims this information is unavailable and discusses unrelated patient details about diet and COVID testing. The response does not address what was actually asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer completely fails to address the question due to a fundamental misreading of the source material. It incorrectly claims doctor statements are absent from the transcript when they are clearly present and labeled throughout. This error leads to a complete failure to identify the doctor's stated plan (physical exam of heart and lungs, consultation with supervising physician, return to discuss next steps) that is explicitly stated in [D-37]. The response instead provides irrelevant information about patient dietary habits and COVID testing. All evaluation dimensions receive the lowest score due to factual incorrectness, zero coverage of required content, misrepresentation of source material, and complete lack of relevance to the question asked."
