  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies headache and cough as initial symptoms starting four days ago [P-1], loss of smell one day ago [P-24], and GI symptoms as 'few days back' [P-1]; however, it approximates GI onset as 'three days into the illness' (imprecise vs. Gold's specific diarrhea 2 days ago [P-28], vomiting yesterday [P-32]), groups all GI together without distinctions, and describes headache/cough as 'persistent' without noting stable severity [P-9, P-11] or other details like dry cough, rating, or location, leading to minor discrepancies but core timeline and stability intact.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: initial symptoms (headache/cough 4 days ago), relative GI onset ('few days back'), loss of smell (1 day ago), and headache/cough persistence/continuation; misses precise GI timings (diarrhea 2 days ago, vomiting yesterday, nausea today), headache details (persistent, bilateral forehead/top, 7/10, atypical, stable), cough details (dry, stable), and pertinent negatives (no fever, no resp worsening), achieving about 80-90% coverage of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: initial symptoms [P-1], GI 'few days back' [P-1], loss of smell [P-24], persistence [P-3]; interpretive 'three days into' derived from transcript phrasing without fabrication; citations accurate; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by detailing temporal progression (first symptoms, relative GI/smell onset), and headache/cough stability (persistent/continued), with clear structure and no off-topic content."
