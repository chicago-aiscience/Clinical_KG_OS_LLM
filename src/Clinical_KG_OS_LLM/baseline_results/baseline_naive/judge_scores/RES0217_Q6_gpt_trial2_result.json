  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the plan included sending the tick for lab species identification and starting prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72h attachment. However, it contains a major factual error by stating the doctor did not provide specific preventive/environmental advice, which directly contradicts the transcript (doctor advised about ticks in long grass/wood-field edges and suggested insecticide). It also over-interprets the physical exam purpose (systemic symptoms were assessed by history, and the explicit plan is only a “quick physical exam” of the bite site).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer items covered: (1) tick sent to lab for ID; (2) physical exam; (3) prophylactic antibiotics. Key items missed: (1) blood work/serology for Lyme (“titres or serology”); (2) planned consultation with/hand-off to another physician; (3) preventive advice about garden/outdoor environment (habitat description and insecticide suggestion). Overall, it captures some core elements but omits multiple major components.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: it claims no preventive advice was given (false), and it attributes exam goals/citations that are not explicitly stated (systemic symptoms ruled out by exam; cites D-5/D-6/P-1 rather than the explicit plan statement at D-18). While parts are grounded (tick lab, antibiotics), there are multiple ungrounded or contradictory claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the requested clinical plan (diagnostics, treatment, prevention), though it incorrectly negates the prevention component. No major off-topic tangents beyond minor framing (e.g., “knowledge graph”)."
