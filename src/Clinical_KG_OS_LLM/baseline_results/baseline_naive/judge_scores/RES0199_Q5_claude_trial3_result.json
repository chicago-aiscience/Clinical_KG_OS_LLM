  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It states the doctor 'did not systematically explore' exposure sources, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor asked about: living situation [D-45/P-45], environmental triggers [D-46/P-46], sick contacts [D-47/P-47], workplace [D-48/P-48, D-50/P-50], and travel history [D-49/P-49]. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer which accurately lists all these explorations.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It omits: (1) living situation details (apartment, alone), (2) environmental trigger screening (carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets), (3) sick contact inquiry (mostly at home, possible work lunchroom exposure), (4) workplace details (car dealership, no sick coworkers noted), (5) travel history (denied), and (6) substance use screening. It covers 0% of the required information.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination. It claims the doctor did not ask about exposure sources when exchanges [D-45] through [D-50] clearly document these inquiries. The citation of [D-52] is accurate regarding COVID testing and isolation, but the claim that 'specific questions regarding potential sources of exposure were not asked' directly contradicts the transcript evidence.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses whether exposure sources were explored, which is relevant to the question. However, it provides an incorrect answer (claiming they were NOT explored) when they clearly were. The focus on COVID-19 testing is tangentially relevant but doesn't address the actual systematic exploration that occurred."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect, claiming the doctor did not systematically explore exposure sources when the transcript clearly documents inquiries about living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48, D-50], and travel [D-49]. It covers none of the key details from the Gold Answer and contains a major factual error that contradicts verifiable transcript content. While somewhat relevant to the question topic, it provides the opposite of the correct answer."
