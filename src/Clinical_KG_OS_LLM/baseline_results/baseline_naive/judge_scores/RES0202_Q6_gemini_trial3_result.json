  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with both the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID swab, the 24-48 hour window, the 14-day isolation (including the sister), the possibility of false negatives, the 'other viral illness' as an alternative, and the specific ER warning signs (high temp, seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific detail from D-45 regarding the hypothetical differential of asthma (if there had been no fever) and the summary note that no medications were prescribed. However, it addresses all specific components requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript, specifically drawing from D-44 and D-45. It does not contain hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and exclusively addresses the multi-part question asked by the user without irrelevant information."
