  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that the transcript does not mention chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, yet all of these are explicitly asked about by the doctor (D-10, D-15, D-16, D-17) and negated by the patient (P-10, P-15, P-16, P-17). It also incorrectly identifies 'cough' as the primary negated symptom, whereas the patient actually indicates a cough might be starting (P-7, P-8).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to list the majority of symptoms negated in the gold answer (vision/hearing, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling). It misses nearly all key points regarding how these specific absences help differentiate the diagnosis, instead relying on general logic about COVID-19 symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the requested symptoms are absent from the transcript. Furthermore, it repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source context, indicating a reliance on external or hallucinated data rather than the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the prompt's structure, its failure to recognize the relevant portions of the transcript makes the response largely irrelevant to the actual clinical dialogue provided."
