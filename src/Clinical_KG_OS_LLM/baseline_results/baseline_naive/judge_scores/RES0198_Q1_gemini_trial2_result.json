  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the stuffy and runny nose occurring for a week and the clear nature of the discharge. However, it is factually incorrect regarding the denied symptoms. The patient explicitly denied cough (P-4), post-nasal drip (P-6), sore throat (P-7), and loss of taste/smell (P-16), all of which the generated answer claims were not denied.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the entire list of denied symptoms which was a primary component of the question. It fails to list cough, sore throat, post-nasal drip, and loss of taste/smell, which are clearly present in both the transcript and the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant hallucination by stating that the patient 'did not explicitly deny any of the specific related symptoms'. This is directly contradicted by the transcript where the patient says 'No' or 'Nope' to multiple symptoms including cough, sore throat, and drainage in the back of the throat.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in structure, addressing all parts of the question, although the content provided for the final section is factually wrong."
