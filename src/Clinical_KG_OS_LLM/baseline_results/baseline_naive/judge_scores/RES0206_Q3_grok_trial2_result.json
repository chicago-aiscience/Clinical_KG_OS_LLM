  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies worsening dyspnea/SOB [P-1] for COPD exacerbation and green-yellow sputum [P-1] plus fever [P-9] for infection, aligning with Gold's core symptoms; it quotes the doctor's dual assessment [D-43] accurately. However, it omits several Gold-listed symptoms (e.g., increased cough frequency/volume, exercise intolerance, sinus pressure, headache, sick contact) and introduces minor inaccuracies like 'standard dry COPD exacerbation' (not in Gold/transcript) and references to wheezing (absent). Core facts match, with minor discrepancies → score 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: worsening dyspnea/SOB [P-1/P-4 partial], green-yellow sputum [P-1], fever [P-9], doctor's assessment [D-43], sputum/fever distinguishing infection. Missed: full COPD syms (incr cough freq [P-1], incr sputum vol [P-1], decr exercise tol [P-4]), full infection syms (sinus press [P-12], headache [P-14], sick contact [P-20]), exclusions (no env exp [P-38], inhaler adherence [P-26]), patient history [P-3], no exam findings/labs plan [D-43]. Covers ~60% of points → score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like worsening SOB [P-1], sputum [P-1], fever [P-9/hot feeling], doctor's quote [D-43] verifiable. Hallucinations: multiple [KG]/Knowledge Graph references (no KG in transcript); 'wheezing' in COPD (absent); 'hallmark of bacterial infection' and causal links plausible but not transcript-grounded; 'dry COPD exacerbation' fabricated. Multiple hallucinated facts → score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists symptoms supporting dual diagnosis of infection/COPD exacerbation with citations; explains sputum/fever distinction per question. KG tangents minor and tied to explanation; highly focused → score 4"
