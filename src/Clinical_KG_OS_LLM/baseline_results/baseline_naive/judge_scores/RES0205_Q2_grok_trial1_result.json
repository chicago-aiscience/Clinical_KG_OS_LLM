  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures no current prescribed medications overall, matching Gold's core fact [P-23]. Acid reflux management via diet (avoiding acidic foods/chocolates, effective) is fully consistent [P-25]. Anxiety noted with no current treatment, aligning but omitting past med detail [P-24]. Cough: no meds, patient requests some [P-35], consistent but adds extra symptom details not emphasized in Gold. Misses hay fever entirely (Gold notes no treatment [P-27]). Adds COVID-19 test negative [P-35], factual but not a core condition in Gold. Minor discrepancies in coverage but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: no prescribed meds [P-23] (implied), acid reflux diet fully [P-25], anxiety no current [part of P-22/P-24], cough no meds/requests [P-35]. Missed: explicit past anxiety med stopped 2-3 years ago [P-24], hay fever no treatment [P-27], doctor's no-prescription-yet plan [D-37], summary of zero meds across all conditions. Extra cough/COVID details not in Gold. Covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: acid reflux/anxiety [P-22/P-25], cough details [P-2/P-5/P-15/P-35], COVID test [P-35]. Citations accurate. Minor issue: references non-existent 'knowledge graph' (prompt has only transcript), but no fabricated facts from transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses current meds/treatment across conditions (acid reflux diet detailed, no meds for anxiety/cough). Structured by conditions matches question. Minor tangents: extra cough symptom details and COVID section (contextual but not core to meds/treatment status)."
