  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer, including the specific diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID-19 swab), physical examination (chest exam), self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate as much as possible), timeline (24-48 hours), public health nurse contact, and disposition criteria (based on results). However, it introduces a minor discrepancy with an unmentioned 'knowledge graph' explanation for the tests' purpose, which is not in the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: physical exam planned (chest and physical exam [D-37]); diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab [D-37]); self-isolation instructions from doctor (stay away from everyone incl. wife, self-isolate [D-37]); timeline (24-48 hours [D-37]); public health nurse if positive [D-37]; disposition criteria (based on results, no specific thresholds implied [D-37]); proceeds to exam [D-38 indirectly via plan]. 100% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims are verifiable in transcript [D-37] with accurate quotes and citations. Minor issue: 'knowledge graph' reference and its explanation ('used to confirm... COVID-19') is not in transcript, representing a hallucinated detail. Physical exam quote slightly paraphrased but faithful. Public health nurse placement under self-isolation is plausible but tied to results in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address all elements of the question (tests, phys exam, self-isolation incl. from whom, timeline, criteria) with no off-topic content beyond minor explanatory tangent."
