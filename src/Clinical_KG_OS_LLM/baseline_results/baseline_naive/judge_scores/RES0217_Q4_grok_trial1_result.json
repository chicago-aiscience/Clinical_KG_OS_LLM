  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the assessment for bullseye rash (erythema migrans) and its absence, with supporting citations (though P-3 is anticipatory and direct denial is in P-6). It accurately notes the proposal to send the tick to the lab for species identification. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer on the points covered; minor citation discrepancy but core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: Features absent - bullseye rash (covered), joint pain (missed), fever/systemic illness (missed), headaches (missed), feeling well otherwise (missed), no other bites (missed). Tests proposed - physical exam (missed), tick to lab (covered), blood work/serology (missed), physician consult (missed). Covers only 1/6 features (~17%) and 1/4 tests (~25%), overall ~20-25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are verifiable in transcript: bullseye rash assessment [D-6, P-3/P-6], absence based on patient description [P-3/P-6], tick to lab [D-6/D-18]. Citations accurate enough (minor shift from P-3 vs P-6 but content matches); no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly addresses the question by listing assessed features (bullseye rash) and proposed tests (tick lab), structured relevantly with no off-topic content or tangents."
