  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the doctor's reasoning process as described in the transcript and Gold Answer. It correctly links the husband's illness to the prioritization of COVID-19, the limited contact to the infectious nature of the illness, and the lack of a flu shot to the inclusion of influenza in the differential. It correctly quotes relevant sections like [D-53] and [D-54].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all three specific epidemiological factors requested in the prompt: the husband's illness, the shared household/limited contact, and the lack of a flu shot. It misses the specific detail from the Gold Answer about the hiking trip as the only other exposure, but captures the overall significance of limited outside contact.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript. However, it references a 'knowledge graph' as a source for symptom-diagnosis links, which is not part of the provided transcript or prompt. This is a minor hallucination regarding the source of information, though the clinical logic itself is sound. It also frames the 'limited contact' section more around isolation (treatment) than the differential logic (household vs. community transmission).",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question, structuring its response around the three specific factors provided and explaining their impact on the doctor's differential diagnosis."
