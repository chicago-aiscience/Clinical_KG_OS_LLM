  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect in its primary claim that the information regarding family history, the brother's cold, and the living situation is missing from the transcript. All of these details are explicitly mentioned in the source text (P-30, P-33, P-39, P-41, P-43). The answer contradicts the evidence provided.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover any of the key points requested in the question. It misses the relationship between the brother's cold as a transmission source, the isolation of the farm during COVID, and the comparison of her current symptoms to her family's history of allergies and asthma. Instead, it lists general symptoms and a diagnosis from an external 'Knowledge Graph' not found in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the absence of information that is clearly present in the transcript. Furthermore, it references an external 'Knowledge Graph' to provide a diagnosis, which is not grounded in the provided source text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer does not address the question asked. The question specifically requests how specific contextual factors (family history, brother's illness, farm living) relate to her symptoms. The generated answer ignores these factors and provides a generic symptom list and diagnosis instead."
