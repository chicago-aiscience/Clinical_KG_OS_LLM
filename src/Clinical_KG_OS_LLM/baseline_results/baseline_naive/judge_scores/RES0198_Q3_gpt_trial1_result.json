  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies key viral-URI supporting features present in the Gold Answer: predominant nasal congestion/rhinorrhea [P-1], clear discharge [P-5], and ~1 week duration with the clinician noting viral symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve [D-39]. However, it introduces inaccuracies and overinterpretations: (a) referencing a “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript and implies external evidence; (b) describing the illness as having a “chronic nature” and contrasting it with “sudden acute allergic reactions” is not stated in the visit and is medically imprecise for a 1-week URI; (c) it implies absence of systemic/bacterial features without citing the specific negatives that the Gold Answer uses (e.g., no fever, no headache, no cough). Overall, the core conclusion is aligned, but with notable unsupported/incorrect embellishments.",
    "completeness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the generated answer covers: (1) symptom type (stuffy/runny nose), (2) clear discharge, and (3) duration plus clinician’s expectation of weeks to improve, and mentions supportive care and COVID testing context. It misses several key supporting elements emphasized in the Gold Answer: absence of cough [P-4], sore throat/SOB/fever/chills [P-7], and post-nasal drip [P-6]; symptom progression from stuffy to mostly runny [P-3]; exposure history arguing against allergy (no fumes/dust/animals [P-22], no known allergies [P-28]); lack of prior recent similar episodes [P-9]; and bacterial-leaning negatives (no fever [P-7], no headache [P-14], no colored discharge [P-5]). It also omits the daycare nephew as a plausible viral exposure. Net coverage is partial (~<50%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (stuffy/runny nose, clear discharge, 1-week duration, clinician diagnosing likely viral/common cold, supportive care and swab for COVID) with appropriate citations for those items. However, multiple elements are not in the transcript: mention of a “knowledge graph,” and the claimed distinction from “sudden acute allergic reactions.” Additionally, it asserts absence of systemic/bacterial features in general terms without tying to the explicitly denied symptoms in the transcript. These reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on why viral was favored over allergic/bacterial, using symptom type, discharge quality, and duration. There is a minor tangent about COVID/supportive care, but it still relates to the clinician’s reasoning and visit context. It does not fully address the exposure-history component asked in the question, but remains mostly on-topic."

  "summary": "The generated answer captures some core viral-URI evidence (clear rhinorrhea and typical timeframe) but omits many key negatives and exposure-history points from the Gold Answer and includes a few unsupported embellishments, resulting in moderate overall quality."
