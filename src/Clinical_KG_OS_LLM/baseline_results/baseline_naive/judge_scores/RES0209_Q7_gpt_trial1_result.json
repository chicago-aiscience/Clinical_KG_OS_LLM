  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the asthma diagnosis at age eight and notes worsening symptoms over ~2 weeks (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) with increased bronchodilator use. However, it fails to accurately describe the key quantitative change in bronchodilator use central to the question (baseline “once every two weeks” to current “almost every day… five six times a week”). It also attributes the “last two weeks” time frame to [D-14], which is not where that clarification occurs (it is clarified at P-13/D-13). The mention of a “knowledge graph” and generic claims about bronchodilators being standard asthma treatment are not part of the Gold Answer comparison and are not needed for factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: diagnosis at age 8; recent ~2-week worsening with dry cough, SOB, wheeze; increased inhaler use in general.\nKey elements missed: patient is now 10 (2-year history); baseline bronchodilator frequency explicitly “once every two weeks”; current frequency explicitly “5–6 times/week”; symptoms described as near-nonstop daytime cough; chest tightness; nighttime symptoms every other day/every two days; wheezing occurs even more often than bronchodilator use (uses only when very difficult to breathe); triggers (exercise, cold air) and seasonal pattern (winter/spring); denial of infectious prodrome/precipitant screening. Overall, it captures well under 80% of required details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most symptom statements are grounded in the transcript, but there are notable ungrounded/incorrect elements: references to a “knowledge graph” and to bronchodilator being “standard treatment” are not in the transcript; the citation for the “last two weeks” duration is incorrect ([D-14] rather than the actual clarification at P-13/D-13). Additionally, the answer omits specific transcript-anchored medication frequency numbers despite being asked about them, reducing transcript-faithful summarization.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (asthma symptom course and bronchodilator use over time) but does not directly answer the question’s requested evolution across the three key periods (initial diagnosis → baseline once every two weeks → current 5–6 times per week). The lack of the requested frequency details and timeline progression makes it only partially responsive."
