  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies simultaneous onset of all three symptoms approximately two days prior [P-1], but inaccurately claims the transcript provides no information on worsening or fluctuation, contradicting explicit patient statements of consistency for sensory symptoms [D-5, P-5] and dry cough [D-8, P-8]; it also misses the direct confirmation that cough started at the same time [D-6, P-6] and understates prior history by not citing the explicit denial [D-3, P-3], leading to significant factual discrepancies with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: simultaneous onset of all symptoms (partial, misses specific cough confirmation). Missed: sensory symptoms consistent without fluctuation [D-5, P-5], cough consistent no worsening [D-8, P-8], none intermittent/variable, partial sensory losses persisted [P-4], direct prior history denial [D-3, P-3]. Covers ~30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims of simultaneous onset grounded [P-1]; however, assertion of 'no information' on progression/fluctuation is a hallucination as transcript directly addresses this [D-5, P-5; D-8, P-8]; history inference lacks direct citation [D-3, P-3] and misrepresents absence; doctor's statement mischaracterized; multiple ungrounded claims of missing info.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses onset timeline, progression (albeit incorrectly claiming absence), and prior history; structured around question elements with no off-topic content."
