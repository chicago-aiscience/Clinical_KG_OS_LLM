  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain the doctor's explicit plan for immediate next steps, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [D-58], which clearly outlines a physical exam, consultation with the physician, and follow-up discussion; it also only mentions air filters for environmental factors, ignoring smoking [P-53], carpets [P-54], pets [P-55], fireplaces [P-56], and townhouse context [P-50], with a minor error attributing the air filters question to the 'patient' instead of the mother.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: plan (physical exam, consult physician, return/discuss next steps, offer questions) - 0% covered; environmental factors (smoking, carpets, pets, fireplaces, air filters, townhouse) - only air filters partially covered (~17%); overall <20% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim of no explicit plan is not verifiable and contradicts [D-58]; air filters citation [D-57] is accurate but misattributed to patient instead of parent; other environmental omissions lead to incomplete grounding; some hallucinated absence of plan.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured directly around the question with sections for environmental factors and doctor's plan, containing no irrelevant or off-topic content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer largely fails by denying the existence of a clearly stated plan in the transcript and omitting most assessed environmental factors, resulting in low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness despite strong relevance."
