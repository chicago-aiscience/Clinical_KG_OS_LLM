  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains two significant factual errors. First, it claims the patient did not report chest tightness, whereas the transcript shows the patient explicitly confirmed this symptom in response [P-20]. Second, it claims there was no information provided regarding nighttime symptoms or a frequency comparison, yet the patient provided specific frequency details and a comparison to daytime symptoms in response [P-18]. The Gold Answer correctly includes these details.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover two major components requested by the prompt: details about chest sensations and the comparison between daytime and nighttime symptoms. It missed approximately 50% of the key points found in the Gold Answer (specifically the chest tightness confirmation, the nighttime frequency of every 2 days, and the explicit statement that nighttime symptoms are less frequent than daytime).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits 'negative hallucinations' by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present. It also references a 'knowledge graph [KG]' which is not part of the provided source text, although this is a minor point compared to the omission of transcript data.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address the question, but by incorrectly stating that half of the requested information is missing, it fails to be fully relevant to the user's specific query."
