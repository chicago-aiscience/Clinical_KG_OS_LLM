{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the two current medications (Avodart for prostate enlargement and Tums for reflux), matching the Gold Answer's facts, including the patient's description of non-cancerous prostate enlargement and as-needed Tums use; the change to the reflux regimen (stopping previous medication after identifying trigger foods) is also factually identical, with consistent citations and no contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: two medications (Avodart/dutasteride for enlarged prostate/BPH, Tums for reflux), specific conditions, independent change to reflux regimen (stopped prior med due to dietary management), and citations; minor details like explicit 'dutasteride', 'over-the-counter antacid', doctor's positive response, and allergies are omitted but not central to the question's requirements, achieving 100% coverage of core points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims (medications, conditions, regimen change) are directly verifiable in the transcript at cited locations [P-25, P-26, P-27]; minor addition of 'calcium carbonate' for Tums is accurate real-world knowledge but not explicitly stated in transcript, representing a minor unverifiable detail; no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured and focused solely on the question's elements—current medications, their conditions, and the specific change to reflux regimen with reason—without any off-topic content or tangents."
