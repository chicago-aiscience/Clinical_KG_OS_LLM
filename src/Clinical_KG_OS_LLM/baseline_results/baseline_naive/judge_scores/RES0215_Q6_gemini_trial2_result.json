  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain the doctor's plan for immediate next steps. In [D-58], the doctor explicitly outlines a plan involving a physical exam, consultation with a physician, and a follow-up discussion. The Generated Answer also fails to mention several environmental factors assessed (smoking, pets, carpets, fireplaces, living situation), only identifying air filters.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the entire three-part plan (exam, consult, follow-up) and omits 6 out of 7 environmental factors mentioned in the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript because it claims information is missing when it is clearly present in [D-58]. This is a significant error in grounding.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question but fails to provide the requested information for the plan and provides a very limited response regarding environmental factors, incorrectly suggesting the text is insufficient to answer the prompt."
