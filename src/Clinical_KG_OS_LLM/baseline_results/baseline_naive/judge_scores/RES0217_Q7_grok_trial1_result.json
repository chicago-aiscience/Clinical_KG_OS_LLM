  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertainty on attachment, >72 hours per doctor, brought tick in container) matching Gold, and prior episode (10y ago, bullseye rash, antibiotics, swollen tick). However, minor discrepancies include omitting Strathroy location, patient's hope it was from hiking not gardening, specific discovery 'earlier today' due to soreness prompting inspection, and precise knee crease location. In comparison, it correctly notes less engorgement now but erroneously attributes 'a little bit swollen' to the bite site rather than the tick itself (P-3/P-4 refer to tick), and omits confirmation of no bullseye rash (P-6) and doctor's grape analogy (D-4). Core facts correct, some errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: hiking Fri/gardening Sat [P-1], uncertainty/hope distinction partially (misses explicit hope), brought container [P-1], >72h [D-6], prior bullseye/antibiotics/swollen tick [P-3], current less engorged tick/not as bad [P-3], local soreness/redness/knee [P-1]. Missed: Strathroy [P-1/P-12], 'earlier today' discovery via soreness [P-1], embedded in knee joint [P-1/D-1], no larger circle rash [P-6], doctor confirms small/not grape-like [D-4]. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All citations accurate and verifiable (e.g., [P-1] for activities/uncertainty/location/symptoms, [P-3] for prior/current comparison, [D-6] for 72h). Claims grounded except minor misinterpretation: 'current site ... only \"a little bit\" swollen' infers site swelling from P-3's tick description and soreness/redness, not explicitly stated (transcript specifies tick small [P-4], site red/tender/sore [P-1/P-6]). No fabrication or external info; plausible but one unverifiable detail.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around timeline (Fri hike-Sat garden-discovery-presentation) and comparison (current symptoms/engorgement vs. prior rash/abx), precisely matching question; minor tangent on prophylactic antibiotics [D-6] is contextually relevant and brief."
