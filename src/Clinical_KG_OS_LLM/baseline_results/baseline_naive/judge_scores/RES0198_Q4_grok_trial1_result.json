  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition (matching Gold's emphasis on both patient [P-1] and doctor [D-39]), the swab test, 48-hour turnaround, and isolation instructions, all consistent with Gold and transcript. Minor omission of 'today' for test and 'further instructions from public health' (which Gold includes but is post-results), but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: condition COVID-19 with citations (100%), swab test (yes, though misses 'today'), 48 hours (yes), main isolation instruction (yes). Missed: explicit 'today' for test, 'further instructions from public health', and some contextual phrasing on pandemic/symptom overlap. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All specific claims (condition, test, TAT, instructions) directly verifiable in cited transcript sections [P-1], [D-39]; no fabricated details. Introductory mention of 'knowledge graph provided' is unverifiable (none in input) but does not introduce errors or ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Answer is structured in bullets directly matching question components (condition, test, TAT, instructions), with no off-topic content; perfectly focused."
