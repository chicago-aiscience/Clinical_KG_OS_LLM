  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies three specific symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough) as the combination leading to suspicion; the Generated Answer incorrectly lists only two (taste and dry cough), omitting loss of smell despite quoting it from P-1, which is a significant factual discrepancy. The patient's initial COVID concern (P-1) is not mentioned, unlike Gold. Connection in D-39 and swab test are accurate, so core point holds but with errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers partial symptoms (2/3), doctor connection [D-39], and test (swab); misses patient's COVID worry [P-1], confirmation of absent symptoms (fever, dyspnea, etc.), 'pretty well' summary [D-16], and isolation protocols, covering roughly 50-60% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about symptoms, quotes from P-1, connection and test in D-39 are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, references a non-existent 'knowledge graph provided' (hallucination, as none is in input), and narrowly interprets symptom combination excluding smell despite its prominence; some unverifiable elements but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly identifies symptoms, explains doctor's connection via D-39 quote, and specifies swab test method, perfectly matching question without irrelevant content."
