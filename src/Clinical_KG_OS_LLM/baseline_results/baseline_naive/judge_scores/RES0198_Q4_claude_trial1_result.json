  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, mentions the swab test ordered, states the 48-hour turnaround time, and includes the isolation instructions. The citations provided directly match those in the Gold Answer and transcript. No factual errors or contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all four required components of the question: (1) condition identified (COVID-19), (2) specific test ordered (swab), (3) expected turnaround time (48 hours), and (4) instructions while awaiting results (stay isolated). It also includes the relevant citations. The only minor difference is that the Gold Answer provides slightly more contextual detail about public health follow-up and pandemic context, but all essential key points are addressed.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The patient's statement about coming in for COVID [P-1], the doctor's acknowledgment of COVID symptoms [D-39], the swab test order [D-39], the 48-hour timeline [D-39], and isolation instructions [D-39] are all present in the source material. No hallucinated information is detected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and precisely addresses all four parts of the multi-part question. It maintains focus on the specific information requested without including extraneous details. The bullet-point format makes it easy to identify each component of the answer corresponding to the question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-cited, and highly relevant response to the multi-part clinical question. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition requiring rule-out, specifies the swab test ordered, states the 48-hour turnaround time, and includes the isolation instructions. All information is properly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer loses only a minor point in completeness for not mentioning the additional public health follow-up detail included in the Gold Answer, but otherwise covers all essential components comprehensively."
