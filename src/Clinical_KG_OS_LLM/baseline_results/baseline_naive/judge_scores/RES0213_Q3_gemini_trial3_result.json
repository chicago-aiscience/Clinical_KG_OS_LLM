  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as anxiety/stress-related and cites several supporting factors consistent with the Gold Answer, such as situational triggers, history of anxiety, and academic stress. It correctly notes that OTC medications did not help. However, it misses the specific physiological description of the episodes (nervousness and hyperventilation) mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of the key points. It misses two major components found in the Gold Answer: 1) the specific clinical observation that the patient breathes faster and feels nervous during episodes [P-19], and 2) the 'pertinent negatives' (absence of fever, asthma, or exertional worsening) that help rule out other pathologies.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains hallucinations regarding the source material. It twice references a 'Knowledge Graph' to support its claims, which was not part of the provided transcript or prompt. While the transcript citations (e.g., [P-4], [P-21]) are accurate, the reliance on a non-existent external tool/source reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question, providing a diagnosis and supporting evidence from the transcript as requested."
