  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies chest tightness [P-1] and difficulty breathing/SOB [P-1, P-7], aligning with Gold's core facts on these. However, it inaccurately claims no upper airway symptoms despite P-11 explicitly mentioning hoarseness, increased phlegm, and throat clearing. It includes irrelevant headache [P-27], not focused on respiratory/chest complaints. For denials, it partially notes chest pain denial but mis-cites [P-1 instead of P-5] and fabricates that fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, cough, anxiety, and sweating are not mentioned, directly contradicting explicit denials in [P-5, P-6, P-11-15]. Misses key details like 3-day duration, diffuse nature [P-8], worsening factors [P-9, P-10]. Significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: chest tightness (partial, misses duration, diffuse, worsening); SOB (partial). Missed entirely: upper airway (hoarse/phlegm/throat clearing [P-11]), full denial list (chest pain full detail, anxiety/sweating/doom [P-6], fevers [P-12], night sweats [P-13], chills [P-14], weight loss [P-15], cough [P-11]). Adds extraneous headache and specific spot pain denial (not in screened list). Covers ~25-30% of Gold points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on chest tightness and SOB verifiable [P-1, P-7]. Headache verifiable but irrelevant [P-27]. Incorrectly states no upper airway symptoms (contradicts [P-11]). Falsely claims no info on fevers/night sweats/etc. (directly contradicted by [P-11-15, P-6]). Chest pain denial cite partially off [P-1 vs P-5]. Multiple misrepresentations/hallucinated absences of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported symptoms and explicit denials as per question. Focuses on respiratory/chest but includes irrelevant headache and off-list 'specific spot pain.' Minor tangents do not derail core addressing of question."
