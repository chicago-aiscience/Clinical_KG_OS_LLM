  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the three OTC medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) tried for chest pain with correct citation [P-6] and states their ineffectiveness matching the patient's words 'hasn't really helped very much' [P-6], aligning fully with Gold. It correctly identifies the multivitamin as the regular supplement [P-25]. The mention of running as a regular routine matches Gold and transcript [P-28]. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: three OTC remedies for pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), their ineffectiveness, daily multivitamin as regular routine. Partially covered: stress management via running (misses reading and 'nervous lately'). Missed: explicit confirmation of no prescription medications, full details on trying to quit smoking (reduced from 10 to 5 cigarettes/day, finding it hard). Covers core elements (meds/supplements/effectiveness) ~80-99%.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: OTC meds and quote from [P-6], multivitamin from [P-25], running from [P-28]. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or inaccurate citations; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses OTC meds/supplements for pain and routine, plus effectiveness; structured response with bullet points focuses precisely on question without irrelevant content, minor inclusion of running aligns with Gold's context."
