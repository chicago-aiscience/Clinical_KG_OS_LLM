  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple significant factual errors. It states the transcript does NOT describe changes in sputum character, when [P-6] clearly documents the change from clear-to-white to yellow. It claims the patient did NOT report orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations, or fever, when [P-9], [P-10], [P-7], [P-14], and [P-29] explicitly show these were asked about and denied. It also states the patient did not endorse systemic symptoms like chills, when [P-29] clearly documents chills. The answer misses chest discomfort [P-13] and increased bronchodilator use [P-12]. These are major contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions increased cough and dyspnea but misses: sputum color change (clear-white to yellow), exertional triggers (walking downstairs), chest discomfort, chills, hemoptysis denial, orthopnea denial, PND denial, palpitations denial, and the extensive list of other pertinent negatives (calf pain, dizziness, numbness, confusion, headaches, bowel changes, nausea, appetite changes, urinary changes, nasal congestion, sore throat, vision/hearing changes, smell/taste changes, weight loss, rashes, fatigue). The answer fundamentally mischaracterizes what information is present in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations and misrepresentations. It claims information is NOT in the transcript when it clearly is present (sputum character change in [P-6], denied symptoms in [P-7], [P-9], [P-10], [P-14], [P-29]). The statement that 'The transcript does NOT describe specific changes in sputum character' is false. The claim that commonly screened symptoms were 'not reported or mentioned' is false - they were explicitly asked about and denied. This represents major fabrication of what the transcript contains.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question's three main components: endorsed symptoms, sputum character changes, and denied symptoms. However, it does so incorrectly by stating information is absent when it is present. While the structure is relevant to the question, the content is largely inaccurate and misrepresents the available information. Some relevant content about increased cough and dyspnea is present, but much is off-base."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely incorrect and incomplete. It fundamentally misrepresents the transcript by claiming critical information (sputum character change, denied symptoms including orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations, and reported chills) is absent when it is explicitly present in the transcript. This represents both factual errors and hallucination. The answer covers less than 20% of key points from the Gold Answer and contradicts verifiable transcript content, making it unreliable for clinical documentation purposes."
