  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is mostly factually accurate compared to the Gold Answer, correctly identifying the chest X-ray, COVID-19 swab, physical exam focused on chest, self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate), 24-48 hour timeline, public health nurse contact if positive, and disposition based on results. Minor discrepancies include slightly rephrasing the physical exam purpose (attributing infection check quote more directly to exam, though transcript links it closely to X-ray), generalizing nurse contact to 'if go home' instead of explicitly 'if positive', and adding unneeded interpretive purpose of tests.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: comprehensive plan [D-37,D-38]; chest-focused physical exam [D-37]; chest X-ray and COVID swab [D-37]; self-isolation details from doctor [D-37]; timeline and nurse contact [D-37]; disposition criteria based on results, no thresholds [D-37]; proceeds to exam [implied]. All elements of the question addressed without omission.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims directly verifiable in [D-37]: tests, exam, isolation, timeline, nurse, criteria all quoted/paraphrased accurately with citations. Minor issues: 'knowledge graph' reference and explanatory purpose ('confirm diagnosis such as COVID-19') not in transcript (hallucination/external); slight misattribution of infection purpose quote to physical exam (transcript ties it post-exam to X-ray). Overall mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to match question's categories (tests, exam, isolation incl. from whom, timeline, criteria), no off-topic content, directly addresses full management plan."
