  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the doctor's prioritization of COVID-19 due to household exposure and the inclusion of influenza due to the lack of a flu shot. It correctly identifies the doctor's plan to test for COVID-19 while advising isolation. It aligns with the Gold Answer's interpretation of the epidemiological factors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the key points: the husband's illness, the shared household/limited contact, and the missing flu shot. However, it misses the specific temporal detail mentioned in the prompt and Gold Answer regarding the 'week-long' duration of the husband's illness versus the patient's 3-day illness, which helps establish the direction of transmission.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript and correctly cites sections like [D-53] and [D-54]. However, it refers to a 'knowledge graph' to justify symptoms indicating COVID-19, which is not present in the source text and appears to be an AI-generated artifact.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question, structuring its response around the three specific epidemiological risk factors provided in the prompt."
