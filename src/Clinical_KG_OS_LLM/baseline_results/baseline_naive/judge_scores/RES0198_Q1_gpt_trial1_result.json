  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy nose and runny nose for ~1 week) and correctly describes the discharge as mostly clear, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript ([P-1], [P-5]). However, it is materially incorrect in stating that the patient did not explicitly deny sore throat, cough, post-nasal drip, and loss of taste/smell. In the transcript, the patient explicitly denies cough ([P-4]), sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills ([P-7]), post-nasal drip/back-of-throat drainage ([P-6]), and loss of taste/smell ([P-16]). The Generated Answer also mischaracterizes [P-27]: that exchange is about other medications besides insulin, not “concerns related to their diabetes.”",
    "completeness": "It covers some key nasal positives: congestion/stuffy nose, runny nose duration, and clear discharge. It omits essentially all key denials requested by the question and present in the Gold Answer (cough, sore throat, post-nasal drip, loss of taste/smell). It also omits other related negatives included in the Gold Answer (e.g., headache/nausea/vomiting, etc.), though those are secondary to the question’s examples. Overall, it captures a minority of required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded and directly contradict the transcript: the claim that the patient did not explicitly deny the listed related symptoms is false given multiple explicit denials ([P-4], [P-6], [P-7], [P-16]). Additionally, the statement about an explicit denial “regarding concerns related to their diabetes” at [P-27] is not supported; [P-27] pertains to other medications. These issues constitute multiple unfaithful/misinterpreted claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly structured around the question (nasal symptoms, discharge character, and denials). However, it introduces an irrelevant point about diabetes/medications and fails to provide the requested denied symptoms content. Despite inaccuracies, it remains largely on-topic."

  "summary": "The answer captures the patient’s nasal congestion/rhinorrhea and clear discharge but incorrectly claims no explicit denials of key related symptoms, contradicting multiple transcript statements, resulting in low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness despite being mostly on-topic."
