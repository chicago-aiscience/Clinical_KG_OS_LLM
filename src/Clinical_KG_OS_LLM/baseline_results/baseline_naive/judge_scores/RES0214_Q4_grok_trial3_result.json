  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53], matching the Gold Answer. However, the rationale for prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza is inaccurately attributed primarily to the symptoms of fever and sore throat alone, quoting [D-53] out of full context; the Gold Answer emphasizes the epidemiological context of household transmission from the husband [P-19, D-53], which is omitted. Influenza is noted as a later possibility [D-54], aligning partially, but the core prioritization reason has a significant discrepancy. Thus, some factual errors but main point (test and prioritization) correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: test (swab [D-53]), prioritization quote snippet [D-53], influenza as later possibility [D-54]. Missed: explicit household transmission/epidemiological rationale (husband's symptoms [P-19, D-53]), self-isolation instructions [D-53, D-54], flu shot detail [P-53, D-54]. Covers ~60% of key points (test and basic prioritization, but incomplete rationale).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are verifiable in transcript: swab ordered [D-53], symptoms (fever/sore throat) match patient history [P-1, etc.], infectious rule-out and prioritization [D-53], influenza possibility [D-54]. Quote accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question (test ordered and rationale for prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza) with structured format, no off-topic content."
