  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects facts from the transcript and aligns closely with the Gold Answer on baseline manageability [P-1], acute symptoms over 3 days (increased cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea [P-1]), worsening trend [P-1, P-9], and deviation from baseline. No factual errors or contradictions; however, it omits Gold's emphasis on explicit 'worst ever' severity [P-3] and prior ED history [P-5, P-6], representing minor discrepancies in depth but core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: baseline with puffers [P-1], 3-day evolution with cough+, sputum+, hemoptysis, dyspnea [P-1], worsening [P-1], fever [P-9], deviation from baseline. Missed: detailed baseline (lifestyle [P-28], rescue inhaler frequency [P-26], multiple daily dog walks [P-4]), explicit progressive worsening quote [P-2], 'worst that I've had' [P-3], prior exacerbations worsened by illness and 2 ED visits without admission [P-3, P-5, P-6]. Covers approximately 60-70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: baseline [P-1], symptoms [P-1], dyspnea [P-1], fever [P-9], exacerbation attribution [D-43]. No hallucinations; interpretations like 'systemic involvement' are plausible inferences from fever but grounded. Doctor's summary [D-43] appropriately included.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses symptom evolution from baseline to acute over 3 days and confirms worsening. Comparison to prior exacerbations is addressed indirectly via baseline deviation and possible admission [D-43], but lacks direct prior history details; mostly focused with no major off-topic content."
