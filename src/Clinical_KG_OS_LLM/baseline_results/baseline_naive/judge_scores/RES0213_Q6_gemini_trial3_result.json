  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by claiming the transcript ends at [P-28] and that no doctor dialogue was included. The provided transcript clearly extends to [P-33], which contains the doctor's concluding remarks and the stated plan. Consequently, the Generated Answer fails to identify the plan described in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the first part of the question (the stated plan). Regarding the second part (clinical information), it covers symptoms, triggers, OTC treatments, family history, smoking, and medications, but misses several key pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of trauma, fever, asthma, and family history of arrhythmias/sudden death.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript is incomplete and ends at [P-28]. This claim is directly contradicted by the 'Source Transcript' provided, which includes dialogue up to [P-33]. The clinical points it does list are grounded in the text, but the initial premise is a hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. It provides a list of clinical information, but it explicitly refuses to answer the first half of the user's prompt based on an incorrect assessment of the source text."
