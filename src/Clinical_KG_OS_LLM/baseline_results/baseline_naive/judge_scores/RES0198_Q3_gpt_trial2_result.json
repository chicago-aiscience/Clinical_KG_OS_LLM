  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several transcript-supported elements favoring a viral URI: prominent nasal congestion/rhinorrhea [P-1], clear discharge [P-5], ~1 week duration [P-1/P-2] and the clinician’s statement that symptoms can take “a few weeks” to resolve [D-39], plus supportive care and COVID swab plan [D-39]. However, it introduces an unsupported claim (“The knowledge graph… corroborates”) and makes a questionable distinction that the course is “chronic” and unlike “sudden acute allergic reactions,” which is not stated in the visit and is not clearly accurate for a one-week illness. It also implies absence of systemic/bacterial features without explicitly tying to the patient’s specific denials (though those denials do exist in the transcript).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points included: (1) absence of cough [P-4], sore throat/SOB/fever/chills [P-7], and post-nasal drip [P-6]; (2) clear (not colored) discharge [P-5]; (3) one-week, fairly constant symptoms [P-8] and typical viral course (“few weeks”) [D-39]; (4) progression from stuffy to runny [P-3]; (5) allergy-leaning negatives: no dust/fumes/animals exposure [P-22], no known allergies [P-28], no recurrent similar episodes [P-9]; (6) bacterial-leaning negatives: no fever [P-7], no headache [P-14], no colored discharge [P-5]; (7) possible daycare exposure via nephew [P-11] (even though not sick [P-12]).\nThe Generated Answer covers (2) and part of (3) and restates (viral dx) but omits most of (1), omits (4), and largely omits exposure/allergy history and the specific bacterial “against” features. Overall it captures less than half of the Gold Answer’s supporting evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (nasal symptoms, clear discharge, duration, clinician’s viral conclusion, supportive care, COVID swab). The explicit mention of a “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript and is therefore hallucinated/unverifiable. The discussion contrasting with allergy/bacterial causes is only loosely supported because it does not reference the specific negative symptoms/exposures actually elicited in the visit.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on evidence for viral vs allergic/bacterial etiologies, which matches the question. Some content (e.g., “knowledge graph” mention and extended COVID context) is not necessary and slightly dilutes the requested comparison to allergic/bacterial causes."

  "summary": "The answer is mostly accurate and on-topic but misses many of the key negative symptoms and exposure-history details that the Gold Answer uses to distinguish viral from allergic or bacterial causes, and it includes a small amount of unverifiable content."
