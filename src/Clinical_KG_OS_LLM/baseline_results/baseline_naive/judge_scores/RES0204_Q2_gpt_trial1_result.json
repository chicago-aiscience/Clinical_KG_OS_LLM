  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies both proposed diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) and accurately states the rationale for the COVID swab as routine testing for anyone presenting with similar symptoms. No statements contradict the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) chest X-ray proposed to better assess what’s going on (D-37); (2) COVID nasal swab proposed (D-39); (3) explicit rationale = protocol/routine testing for anyone with these symptoms lately (D-39). Missing/minor omissions vs Gold: it does not mention the doctor’s explanation of X-ray as ‘taking a picture of your body on the inside’ (D-39), nor the plan to arrange tests and return with the supervising doctor (D-40), nor that no medications/treatments were prescribed (though not strictly asked).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript (D-37, D-39). No hallucinated procedures, indications, or results.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what diagnostic procedures were proposed and the specific rationale for ordering the COVID swab, with no meaningful off-topic content."
