  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the symptoms and their timing based on the transcript and is fully consistent with the Gold Answer's primary findings. It correctly categorizes the onset symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue), recent symptoms (fever, taste), and emerging symptoms (sore throat, cough, headaches).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several specific symptoms included in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits 'weakness', 'reduced appetite', and 'generalized body aches' from the onset phase, and 'diminished smell' from the recent phase. While it covers the major categories, it captures approximately 70% of the specific symptomatic details found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using direct quotes and correct speaker tags (e.g., [P-1], [P-4]) to support its claims. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the multi-part question regarding the timeline of symptom development. The inclusion of a 'Clinical Context' section at the end is slightly outside the scope of the timeline request but remains relevant to the overall case."
