  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the COVID swab order and expected 24–48 hour turnaround, the 14-day isolation recommendation (including separating from the younger sister if possible), the doctor’s comment about possible false negatives, the alternative explanation of another circulating viral illness if negative, and the specific ER return precautions (high temperature, neurologic symptoms مثل seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). No statements contradict the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: COVID swab + 24–48h turnaround; 14-day isolation including from sister; possibility of false negatives; alternative diagnosis of another viral illness; ER warning signs with an example (seizures). Key elements missed: (a) the doctor’s explicit overall assessment framing it as an infectious/viral process aligned with COVID; (b) the added differential point that asthma would be considered if cough/SOB occurred without fever (D-45); (c) the explicit ‘watchful waiting/no medications prescribed’ summary present in the Gold Answer. Overall coverage is high but not fully complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are directly supported by D-44 (and generally consistent with the visit). The answer does not introduce new tests, treatments, diagnoses, or warning signs beyond what is stated. Minor issue: it attributes all content specifically to D-44 and does not mention D-45, but it also does not fabricate D-45 content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested assessment/plan components: test + turnaround time, isolation duration, alternative if negative, false negatives, and ER warning signs with examples. No irrelevant tangents."
