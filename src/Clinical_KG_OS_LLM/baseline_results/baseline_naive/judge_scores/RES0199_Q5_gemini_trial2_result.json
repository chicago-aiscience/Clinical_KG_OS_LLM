  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect and directly contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer. It claims the doctor did not explore exposure sources, whereas the transcript shows the doctor explicitly asked about the living situation [D-45, D-46], sick contacts [D-47, D-50], workplace [D-48], and travel [D-49].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points mentioned in the Gold Answer. It fails to identify any of the specific inquiries regarding the car dealership, apartment living, environmental triggers, or travel history.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript. It falsely asserts that specific questions regarding exposure were 'not asked or discussed,' which is a direct hallucination of the interaction's absence despite clear evidence in turns D-45 through D-50.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question appropriately because it provides a false negative. It denies the existence of the information requested by the prompt, even though that information is present in the source text."
