  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect. It claims that the transcript lacks doctor turns and consists only of patient statements (P-2 through P-35), which is factually false. The transcript provided clearly includes doctor turns D-1 through D-38, with D-37 explicitly detailing the plan, physical exam components (heart and lungs), and the process for next steps.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not mention the auscultation of heart/lungs, the consultation with the supervising physician, or the plan to reconvene with the patient. It missed 100% of the required information.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the provided source. It hallucinates a limitation of the transcript (claiming it only contains patient turns) that does not exist. It also provides information about reflux and COVID tests which, while present in the transcript, are irrelevant to the specific question asked.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is not relevant as it fails to address the question. Instead of answering the prompt using the available text, it provides an erroneous explanation of why it cannot answer, followed by tangential patient history."
