  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several major factual errors. It incorrectly claims the transcript does not contain the doctor's dialogue or plan, whereas [D-43] explicitly states the plan to consult with a supervisor and return. It also claims no alleviating factors were identified, ignoring the patient's mention of Tylenol [P-14] and expectoration [P-13] helping. It also incorrectly interprets a runny nose from a week ago [P-16] as a 'history of back pain' which had 'gone away'.",
    "completeness": "The answer is missing almost all key points from the Gold Answer: the doctor's plan (consulting a supervisor), Tylenol as a self-care measure, expectoration as an alleviating factor, and physical exertion/stairs as an aggravating factor. It only successfully identifies coughing and deep breathing as aggravating factors and resting as self-care.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It hallucinates that the transcript is incomplete ('does not contain the doctor's dialogue') and misidentifies a 'runny nose' [P-16] as 'back pain'. These are significant hallucinations regarding the content and structure of the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address the specific parts of the question (Plan, Self-Care, Factors), but because it incorrectly assumes data is missing, it fails to provide the relevant information actually present in the text."
