  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the mother's suspicion of school as the source [P-2, P-1], no known sick contacts outside school [P-38], lack of specific known sick contacts at school (aligning with 'kinda hard to say' [P-38]), and no school notification (consistent with [P-39]). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: school as suspected source and timing [P-1, P-2] (yes); no known sick contacts outside school [P-38] (yes); ambiguous/unknown at school [P-38] (partial, via 'no specific information'); school not notified [P-39] (yes, 'does not indicate'); misses school COVID test requirement for return [P-41], no travel [P-40], no environmental exposures [P-37] (used in Gold to narrow source). Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly grounded in transcript: mother's quotes cited accurately [P-1, P-2]; no known outside from [P-38]; no specifics at school or notifications verifiable in [P-38, P-39]; no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses all parts of the question: school attendance as suspected source, mother's reports on sick contacts (school vs. outside), and school notifications, with structured bullet points focused on query without off-topic content."
