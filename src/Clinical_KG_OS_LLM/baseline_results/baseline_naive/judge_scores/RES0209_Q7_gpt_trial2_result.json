  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- The Generated Answer correctly states the patient was diagnosed with asthma at age 8 (P-2) and describes current symptoms of dry cough (P-1/P-14), shortness of breath (P-1), and increased wheezing (P-15).\n- However, it inaccurately cites “last two weeks” as coming from D-14; the duration clarification is at P-13 (and D-13 asks about the timeframe). D-14 is about the cough being dry.\n- It also introduces “[KG] knowledge graph” assertions (e.g., “standard treatment,” “confirms diagnosis”) that are not part of the provided transcript and thus are not verifiable.\n- It does not state the key quantitative bronchodilator frequencies (“once every two weeks” baseline; “almost every day, 5–6 times/week” currently), but it also does not contradict them.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points vs Generated Answer:\n- ✓ Diagnosis at age 8; now age 10 / ~2-year history: partially covered (diagnosis at 8 included; current age/2-year history omitted).\n- ✗ Baseline control and specific rescue use: “once every two weeks”: omitted.\n- ✗ Current escalation to “almost every day, 5–6 times/week”: omitted.\n- ✓ Current exacerbation duration “last two weeks”: mentioned, but cited incorrectly.\n- ✓ Current daytime symptoms (near-nonstop dry cough, SOB, wheeze): partially covered (dry cough/SOB/wheeze included; “near-nonstop throughout the day” omitted).\n- ✗ Chest tightness: omitted.\n- ✗ Nighttime symptoms every other day/every two days: omitted.\n- ✗ Wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use; uses bronchodilator only when very hard to breathe: omitted.\n- ✗ Baseline triggers/seasonality (exercise, cold air; winter/spring/pollen): omitted.\n- ✗ No infectious precipitant identified after screening: omitted.\nOverall, it captures only a minority of the clinically important evolution details requested.",
    "faithfulness": "- Several statements are not grounded in the transcript, notably repeated references to a “knowledge graph [KG]” and claims based on it.\n- The timeframe citation is incorrect (D-14 does not establish two-week duration).\n- Otherwise, the symptom statements included (dry cough, SOB, wheeze, increased use in general) are consistent with transcript content, but the ungrounded [KG] elements and citation error reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "- The response is generally aimed at describing the evolution of asthma symptoms and bronchodilator use over time.\n- However, it fails to answer the core of the question (the explicit baseline frequency and the current 5–6 times/week near-daily use, plus key evolution details like nighttime symptoms and bronchodilator-use context).\n- No major off-topic tangents, but it is only partially responsive to what was asked."
