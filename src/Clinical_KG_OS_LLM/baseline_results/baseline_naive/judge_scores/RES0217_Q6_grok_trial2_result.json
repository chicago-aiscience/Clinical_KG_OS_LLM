  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the tick laboratory identification and prophylactic antibiotics, matching Gold [D-6, D-13, D-18]. It mentions a physical exam but uses incorrect citations [D-5, D-6, P-1] instead of [D-18] and adds unstated details like ruling out systemic symptoms via exam (already queried verbally). Major errors: omits blood work for Lyme serology/titres [D-18]; omits planned physician consultation [D-13, D-22]; incorrectly states no preventive advice for garden despite explicit transcript details on tick habitats and insecticide [D-18]. Introduces 'knowledge graph' not in transcript. Significant contradictions and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: physical exam (covered), tick lab (covered), blood work (missed), antibiotics (covered), physician consultation (missed), preventive advice on garden/ticks/insecticide (missed and wrongly denied). Covers ~3/6 key points (50-60%), partial on diagnostics and treatment.",
    "faithfulness": "Tick lab and antibiotics verifiable [D-6, D-13, D-18]. Physical exam grounded but citations wrong and details hallucinated (e.g., 'bullseye rash' evaluation, systemic symptoms via exam). 'Knowledge graph' fully hallucinated, not in transcript. Denies preventive advice despite direct quotes [D-18] on long grass, waving legs, insecticide for garden. Multiple hallucinated/inaccurate claims.",
    "relevance": "Structures response around diagnostics, therapeutics, preventive advice, directly mirroring question categories. Minor tangents in exam details and inquiries (not plan). Off-topic denial of preventive advice but still addresses question structure."
