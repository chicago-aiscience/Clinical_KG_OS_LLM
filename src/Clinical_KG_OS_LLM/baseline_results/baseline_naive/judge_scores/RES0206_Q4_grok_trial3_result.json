  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19) and the test (COVID swab with citation [D-43]), matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that 'the transcript does not explicitly list details regarding the patient's recent social contacts' (directly contradicted by [P-20], [D-21], [P-21]), and attributes the prompting to symptoms like fever and sputum instead of the sick friend exposure, which is a significant factual contradiction with the Gold Answer's emphasis on social contacts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) condition COVID-19 (covered), (2) test COVID swab [D-43] (covered), (3) prompting detail - sick friend during dog walks, walking too close outdoors, unsure about friend's COVID test [P-20, P-21] (completely missed and denied), plus screening symptoms/travel (not covered). Covers only ~30-40% of key points, primarily condition and test.",
    "faithfulness": "Condition and test verifiable in [D-43]. Symptoms mentioned (fever [P-9], sputum [P-1]) are in transcript. However, claim 'transcript does not explicitly list details regarding social contacts' is hallucinated/false (directly in [P-20/D-20/D-21/P-21]). Misattributes prompting away from exposure history, introducing unverifiable causal link; multiple discrepancies from transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured with bullet points directly matching the question's three elements (condition, test, prompting detail), with no extraneous content or tangents, fully focused despite inaccuracy in third part."
