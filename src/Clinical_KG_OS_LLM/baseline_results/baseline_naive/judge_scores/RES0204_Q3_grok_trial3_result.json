  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key present symptoms (dry cough, clear runny nose) and cites the transcript accurately for rationales ([D-37] for X-ray, [D-39] for COVID swab). It matches the Gold Answer's core reasoning that persistence prompts X-ray and protocol drives swab. However, it underemphasizes the role of absent findings (e.g., no fever, anosmia) as 'high-acuity markers' absent despite persistence, and inaccurately attributes family history linkage to a non-existent 'knowledge graph.' Minor discrepancies in emphasis and addition of unstated inferences like pneumonia.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: present symptoms (dry cough, clear runny nose, partial on duration/non-improving); rationales for X-ray (persistence, [D-37]) and COVID ([D-39] protocol); family history. Missed or partial: explicit durations (4-5 days, couple days), non-productive confirmation [P-6], not improving [P-7], full list of pertinent negatives (sore throat, taste/smell, chest/muscle pain, headaches, N/V, abd pain), no sick contacts/travel, novelty of dry cough [P-24], absent high-acuity markers enabling workup. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: symptoms and citations ([D-5,11,12,37,39]) verifiable; physical exam [D-1], family history [D-28+], protocol quote direct. Hallucinations: 'knowledge graph provided/linked' (absent from transcript); inferring 'rule out pneumonia' (plausible but not stated, doctor says 'better look'); 'respiratory distress' overstated as patient denies many symptoms. Multiple unverifiable additions reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by breaking down how present symptoms (cough, runny nose) led to orders via transcript quotes and rationales (X-ray for lungs, swab for protocol). Tangents like knowledge graph and pneumonia slightly off, but core focus on symptom combination and decisions aligns well; absent findings implied but not detailed."
