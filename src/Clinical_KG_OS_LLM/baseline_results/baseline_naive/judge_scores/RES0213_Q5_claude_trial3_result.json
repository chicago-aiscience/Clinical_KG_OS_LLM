  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the three main factors (family history, smoking, psychosocial stressors) from the Gold Answer. It correctly cites the father's heart attack in his 50s [P-8, P-30], the smoking history (starting at 18, 10 cigarettes daily for 2 years, reduced to 5) [P-13, P-14, P-18], and the thesis-related stress [P-15, P-16]. The answer correctly quotes the patient's explicit concern about it being 'a heart thing' and her father's situation scaring her. However, it makes some interpretive errors: it incorrectly states she 'hasn't seen a doctor in eight years' due to family worry when the transcript indicates she hasn't seen a doctor about anxiety attacks in 8 years [P-21], not for general care. It also invents details about 'knowledge graph relationships' that aren't in the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: father's heart attack in 50s, current heart doctor visits, patient's explicit fear and connection to 'heart thing,' smoking history details, thesis deadline pressure, living alone, and the connection to anxiety/stress. However, it misses some specific details: the grandfather's death in an accident with unknown cardiac history, nervousness about running lately, teenager anxiety attacks potentially returning [P-22], and the specific observation that pain goes away when talking to people/doing tasks [P-29]. The answer does add synthesis about medication trials [P-6] which adds context.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. However, there are concerning issues: (1) The answer references a 'knowledge graph' showing smoking causes heart attacks, which is not present in the source transcript - this appears to be hallucinated content brought in from outside the provided materials. (2) The claim about not seeing a doctor in 8 years is misrepresented - the transcript specifies this relates only to anxiety treatment [P-21]. (3) The answer invents interpretations like 'setting aside time to read school books at night rather than relaxing books' which distorts [P-28] where she says she reads books she likes instead of school books. These represent significant faithfulness issues.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three components of the question: family history contribution, smoking history contribution, psychosocial stressor contribution, their interactions, and supporting details from consultation. The structure is well-organized with clear sections for each factor and a synthesis section. All content is focused on answering the specific question asked. Minor tangent about medication trials adds context without detracting from relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates strong relevance and good structural organization, correctly identifying the three main factors and their interactions. It provides accurate citations for most key points about family history, smoking, and stress. However, it suffers from significant faithfulness issues including hallucinated 'knowledge graph' references and misrepresentation of the 8-year doctor visit detail. Completeness is moderate, missing some specific details like the grandfather's history, anxiety attack recurrence concerns, and pain patterns with social interaction. The correctness is compromised by interpretive errors despite getting core facts right."
