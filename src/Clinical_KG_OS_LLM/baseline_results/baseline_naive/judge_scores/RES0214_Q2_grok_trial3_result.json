  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately states multivitamins only [P-40], pre-diabetic with no Rx meds [P-33], no HBP [P-34], no cholesterol [P-35], penicillin allergy [P-37] with rash [P-38] and no breathing issues [P-39]. Generated Answer incorrectly claims no explicit medication regimen (misses multivitamins [P-40]), partially notes pre-diabetic status but omits no Rx confirmation, correctly identifies penicillin allergy [P-37], but factually errs by stating no specific adverse reaction despite explicit 'rash' [P-38]. Significant factual errors and omissions contradict Gold and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: multivitamins [P-40], pre-diabetic monitoring no Rx [P-33], no HBP [P-34], no cholesterol [P-35], penicillin [P-37], rash [P-38], no breathing trouble [P-39]. Generated covers pre-diabetic mention [P-33] partially and penicillin allergy [P-37]; misses multivitamins, no Rx/HBP/cholesterol confirmations, rash, and no dyspnea. Covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims no explicit meds (contradicts [P-40] multivitamins), notes pre-diabetic correctly [P-33], allergy correct [P-37], but hallucinates no specific reaction despite 'rash' [P-38] directly answering D-38. Multiple inaccuracies and fabricated absences not grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly around the question's components (meds regimen, allergy, reaction), with bullet points matching each part; no off-topic content despite factual errors."
