  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely inconsistent with the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states the doctor’s end-of-visit recap focused on headache, fever, and night sweats, and it adds an unsupported conclusion that these indicate a “common cold.” In the transcript, the doctor’s actual summary (D-58) includes: 3–4 days of dry cough, a little fever, some headache, no sputum, minimal sick contacts except a brother with a cold ~2 weeks ago, no asthma, and only medication being Claritin. The generated answer also misstates Jessica’s goal: the transcript (P-60) shows she wants to know if she needs medicine; the generated answer claims her goal was simply to end the visit and cites [P-59], which is not about visit goals. These are major factual errors that contradict the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses most key elements from the Gold Answer: cough duration and dryness, no sputum, sick-contact history (brother’s cold), no asthma, only Claritin, and the doctor’s framing about “next steps.” It also omits Jessica’s stated main goal (whether she needs medicine) and her desire to go home and lie down. Overall it covers well under 20% of the required key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims are not grounded in the transcript: (1) asserting the doctor was confirming “night sweats” (the doctor asked; Jessica described feeling hot, not true drenching sweats), (2) introducing a “knowledge graph,” (3) concluding the symptoms indicate a “common cold,” and (4) mis-citing Jessica’s goal using [P-59], which in the transcript is unrelated to goals. This reflects substantial hallucination and misuse of citations.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at the right categories (doctor’s recap and patient’s goal), but it pivots to an unsupported diagnosis and incorrectly identifies the patient’s primary goal. Thus it is only partially responsive to the question."
