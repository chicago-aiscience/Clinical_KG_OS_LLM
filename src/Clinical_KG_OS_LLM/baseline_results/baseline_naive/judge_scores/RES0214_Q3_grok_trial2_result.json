  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies fever and sore throat as the specific symptoms from [D-53] that led to suspicion of infectious etiology like COVID-19, matching the Gold Answer's explicit identification. It also accurately notes the patient's report of these symptoms in [P-1] and mentions muscle aches from [P-13], which aligns with the broader symptom cluster in Gold ([D-24]). However, it inaccurately claims the doctor associates muscle aches with COVID in [D-53], which is not stated there (minor factual error). For influenza, it correctly links the flu shot inquiry [D-53] and doctor's statement [D-54], consistent with Gold. Core facts are correct with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: fever/sore throat [D-53]; broader cluster (muscle aches, fever, stuffy nose, sore throat [D-24]); epi (husband's symptoms [D-53]); no flu shot [P-53] prompting influenza [D-54]. Generated covers fever/sore throat (explicit), muscle aches (partial broader), flu shot perfectly. Misses stuffy nose in doctor's summary [D-24] and entire epi context of husband's symptoms. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims verifiable: fever/sore throat [D-53, P-1]; muscle ache [P-13]; flu shot [D-53/D-54]. Minor hallucination: doctor linking muscle ache specifically to 'infectious diagnosis of COVID [D-53]'—[D-53] does not mention muscle ache (doctor summarizes symptoms earlier in [D-24]). Citations mostly accurate; content mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by specifying symptoms (fever, sore throat) for infectious/COVID suspicion and vaccination history (no flu shot) for influenza differential, with evidence directly tied to query. Minor extra patient corroboration but no tangents."
