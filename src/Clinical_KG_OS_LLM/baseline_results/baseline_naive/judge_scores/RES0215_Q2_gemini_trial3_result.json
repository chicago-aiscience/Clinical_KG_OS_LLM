  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer regarding the use of Reactine for allergies and the absence of prescribed medications.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two key points from the Gold Answer: 1) that no medications or treatments are used for the current wheezing/shortness of breath episodes (they resolve with rest), and 2) that no antibiotics were used for previous viral infections. Since the question specifically asked about treatments for 'current respiratory episodes', this is a significant omission.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript, specifically citations P-36 and P-46.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant but incomplete, as it focuses only on the medications taken and the lack of prescriptions, while ignoring the 'current respiratory episodes' part of the prompt's request for treatment information (which was 'none')."
