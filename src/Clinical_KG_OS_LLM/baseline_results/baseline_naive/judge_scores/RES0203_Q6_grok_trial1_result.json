  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the assessment of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 [D-39], the COVID test via swab [D-39], timeline of 1-2 days [D-39], and self-isolation instructions including potential extension if negative [D-39], aligning with Gold. However, it incorrectly asserts no mention of consulting a supervising physician despite [D-40] explicitly stating 'we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today,' directly contradicting Gold. It also omits the patient being otherwise well [D-16], possible additional tests [D-40], potential further questions [D-40], and reassurance [D-41], introducing significant factual discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: symptoms consistent with COVID [D-39] (partial, misses 'otherwise well'), COVID test/swab [D-39], isolation instructions [D-39], timeline [D-39]. Missed: patient otherwise well [D-16], mention of additional tests [D-40], plan to consult supervising physician [D-40], possible more questions [D-40], reassurance [D-41]. Covers approximately 50-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on assessment, test method, timeline, and isolation are fully verifiable in [D-39] with accurate citations. The claim that the transcript does not mention consulting a supervising physician is incorrect and not grounded, as [D-40] explicitly describes it ('we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today'); this is a hallucinated absence of a key fact, though other content is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around the question's elements (assessment, tests with method, self-care, timeline, consult), using headings for clarity, with no off-topic content; fully addresses the query despite gaps."
