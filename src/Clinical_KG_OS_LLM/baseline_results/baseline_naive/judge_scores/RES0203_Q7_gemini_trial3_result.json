  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough) began simultaneously two days prior. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not provide information on whether symptoms worsened or fluctuated; the transcript explicitly states they were 'pretty consistent' (P-5, P-8). Furthermore, it claims there is no mention of prior history, whereas the patient explicitly denies having experienced this before in P-3.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include the patient's specific confirmation that symptoms were consistent/not fluctuating and that there was no prior history of these symptoms. These are key points in the Gold Answer and the source transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains 'negative hallucinations' by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present. Specifically, it claims the transcript doesn't discuss progression or prior history, which contradicts exchanges P-3, P-5, and P-8.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, directly attempting to answer each component of the multi-part question, although its conclusions regarding the available data are incorrect."
