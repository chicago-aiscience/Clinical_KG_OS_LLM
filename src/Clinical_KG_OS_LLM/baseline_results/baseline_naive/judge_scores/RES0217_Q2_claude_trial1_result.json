Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",

All claims are well-grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations. However, it omits several important details present in the Gold Answer, including allergy status, consultation plans, environmental prevention recommendations, and additional context about the treatment decision-making process. The response is highly relevant and correct but could be more comprehensive."
