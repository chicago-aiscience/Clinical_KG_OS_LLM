  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) and the specific location. However, it incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain evidence of the doctor screening for fever, joint pain, or headaches. These are explicitly present in the source text: joint pain in D-7/P-7, fever in D-8/P-8, and headaches in D-19/P-19.",
    "completeness": "The answer only covers the first part of the question regarding local symptoms. It fails to list the systemic symptoms asked for in the second part of the question, incorrectly stating they are not in the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on faithfulness by claiming the transcript lacks information that is clearly present. It also misattributes the patient's 'No' responses in P-7, P-8, and P-19 to drug allergies, whereas they were responses to joint pain, fever, and headaches respectively.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it addresses the local symptoms, but it fails to provide the requested information regarding systemic symptoms, despite the question explicitly asking for them."
