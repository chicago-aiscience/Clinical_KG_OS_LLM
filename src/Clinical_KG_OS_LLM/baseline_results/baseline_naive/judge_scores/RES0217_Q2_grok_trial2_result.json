  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient's current statin therapy (name not recalled, [P-15]), past antibiotics for a prior tick bite with bullseye rash ([P-3]), and the doctor's proposal for prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72-hour attachment ([D-6]), all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript; no factual errors or contradictions, though it omits some details like allergies and cholesterol context.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: current statin (can't recall name), past antibiotics for bullseye rash from prior tick bite, prophylactic antibiotics proposed due to >72h attachment. Missed: cholesterol management context [P-14], denial of allergies/no drug allergies [P-16,P-17], doctor's reiterated statements [D-13,D-18], no specific antibiotic details stated, plan to consult supervising physician [D-13,D-22], environmental insecticide suggestion [D-18]. Covers approximately 50-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: statin [P-15], prophylactic antibiotics and 72-hour reasoning [D-6], past antibiotics and rash [P-3]; the summary of exposure (hiking/gardening Fri/Sat) aligns with [P-1,D-6]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses the question by structuring response around current statin therapy, proposed prophylactic antibiotics for tick bite, and relevant past treatment, with no off-topic content."
