  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error by claiming the doctor did not provide preventive advice about the garden, whereas the transcript (D-18) explicitly shows the doctor advising on long grass and the use of insecticide. It also misses the blood work and the planned physician consultation components found in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers 3 out of the 6 key elements identified in the Gold Answer: physical exam, tick identification, and antibiotic prophylaxis. It misses the blood work (titres/serology), the specific details of the garden advice (insecticide/long grass), and the consultation with the supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes a false negative hallucination by stating that preventive advice was not in the provided transcript. This misrepresents the source text which contains specific instructions on environmental management.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing the specific categories requested in the prompt (diagnostics, treatments, and advice), even though the content within those categories is flawed."
