  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Core themes align with the Gold Answer: father’s MI in his 50s prompting fear of a “heart thing,” patient smoking and trying to quit, and significant school/thesis stress associated with symptom attention. However, there are factual/interpretive errors relative to the transcript/Gold Answer: (1) it reverses the stress-management detail—patient reads books she likes “instead of…school books” [P-28], not “school books at night rather than relaxing books”; (2) it implies she runs “for anxiety,” whereas she says she enjoys running and has been nervous to do it lately [P-28]; (3) it states she links smoking directly to the onset of pain/heart fear, but her explicit heart worry is tied to her father’s event and she only separately mentions difficulty quitting while stressed [P-8, P-13]; (4) it speculates that not seeing a doctor in 8 years is due to family worry—unsupported; (5) it adds “knowledge graph” causal claims not in the consultation. These issues lower factual accuracy vs the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Includes some key Gold Answer points: father’s heart attack last year in his 50s and that it scares her [P-8], current reduced smoking (~5/day) and trying to quit [P-14], and academic stress with studying/walking correlating with symptoms [P-4]. Missing or inadequately covered: (1) smoking trajectory (started ~18, ~10/day for last two years, cut down for months, quitting is hard amid school) [P-13, P-18]; (2) thesis/end-of-program time-crunch details [P-15, P-16]; (3) living alone/limited social contact [P-26, P-27]; (4) nervousness during episodes with faster breathing [P-19]; (5) prior anxiety attacks and concern they may return [P-22]; (6) father now seeing many heart doctors [P-30]; (7) paternal grandfather’s death in an accident and unknown cardiac history [P-30]. Overall ~50–70% of key elements are covered.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript and/or are contradicted: the “knowledge graph” references and explicit smoking→heart attack linkage as a cited relationship are external; the reading detail is wrong (patient reads non-school books) [P-28]; “running for anxiety” is not stated; “hasn’t seen a doctor in eight years…due to…family worry” is speculation not supported by [P-21]. While many other claims are supported (father’s MI, stress, smoking reduction), the number of ungrounded/incorrect details is substantial.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stress contribute to and interact with her heart-disease concern, and it attempts to cite consultation details. Minor tangents (e.g., “knowledge graph,” mechanistic/genetic framing) reduce focus slightly but it remains on-topic."
