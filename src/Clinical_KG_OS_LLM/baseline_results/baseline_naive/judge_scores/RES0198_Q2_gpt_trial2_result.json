  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is partially correct but contains a major factual error relative to the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states the transcript does not mention any medication tried; however, the patient explicitly reports trying “decongestants” [P-10]. It also mischaracterizes effectiveness as “not improving” based on [P-1], whereas the relevant effectiveness assessment in context is that the decongestant “worked a little bit” [P-10]. The recommended OTC treatment (“Tylenol cold”) is correctly captured from [D-39].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) doctor recommended OTC medication like Tylenol Cold. Key points missed: (1) patient had already tried OTC decongestants; (2) patient felt it helped “a little bit”/ambiguous benefit as congestion shifted to runny nose; (3) doctor’s other supportive-care recommendations (hydration) and counseling that symptoms may take a few weeks and there is little beyond supportive care. Overall coverage is well under 50% of Gold Answer details.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly drawn from the transcript, but it includes a notable ungrounded/contradicted claim: that there was no information about medications tried, which conflicts with [P-10]. The characterization of effectiveness as “doesn’t seem to be getting any better” is supported by [P-1] but is not the specific response to the question about medication effectiveness and downplays/contradicts [P-10]. No clear fabrication beyond this misread, but there is a significant contradiction.",
    "relevance": "It directly addresses all three parts of the question (what tried, effectiveness, and what was recommended), though the first two parts are answered incorrectly."
