  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key symptoms supporting URI diagnosis (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, subjective fever) with correct transcript citations. However, it introduces content about a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the provided materials, which is a significant factual error. The core clinical reasoning about symptom correlation is correct, but the framing around this non-existent knowledge graph undermines accuracy.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer including the main symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, fever, headache), the absence of sputum production, and the exclusion of GI symptoms and joint pain. However, it misses several important details: the timeline of symptom progression (scratchy throat followed by cough), the specific characterization of malaise, the mention of fatigue, the brother's recent cold as viral exposure context, and the doctor's summary. It covers approximately 60-70% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a critical faithfulness problem: it repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' and 'clinical knowledge base' that do not exist in the provided transcript. Phrases like 'According to the knowledge graph' and 'the knowledge graph establishes' are hallucinated content. While the actual symptoms cited (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, fever) are accurately quoted from the transcript with correct citations [P-1, P-7, P-9, P-18], the framework claiming these come from a knowledge graph is fabricated. This represents multiple hallucinated claims about the source of diagnostic reasoning.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about how symptoms support URI diagnosis. It systematically explains symptom correlation, addresses the absence of contradictory symptoms, and discusses differential diagnosis considerations. However, it includes the irrelevant framework of a 'knowledge graph' that adds confusion. The clinical content itself (symptoms, their interpretation, and exclusion criteria) is highly relevant, but the presentation method introduces unnecessary and confusing elements."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates sound clinical reasoning about URI diagnosis and correctly identifies most relevant symptoms from the transcript with accurate citations. However, it contains a critical flaw: repeatedly referencing a non-existent 'knowledge graph' as the source of diagnostic criteria, which constitutes significant hallucination. While the core clinical content is largely correct and relevant, missing key details like symptom timeline, malaise characterization, and viral exposure context reduce completeness. The hallucinated framework significantly undermines both correctness and faithfulness despite accurate symptom citations."
