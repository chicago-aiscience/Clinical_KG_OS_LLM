  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the causal connection between the missed Keppra dose and the seizure, accurately quotes P-9 as evidence of the patient's recognition, and supports with accurate citations to P-8 (seizure disclosure) and P-23 (medication name). All facts align fully with the Gold Answer and transcript, with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: missed dose connected to seizure (via P-8/P-9), patient's explicit recognition in P-9 quote. Missed: P-24 details on why dose missed (daughter's birthday/disrupted routine), rarity of seizures ('usually don't get seizures very often'), voluntary nature in response to D-9, emphasis on no clinician confirmation. Covers core (about 85%) but omits supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: P-9 quote is exact ('Um I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have yeah'), P-8 confirms seizure/epilepsy, P-23 names Keppra, patient's attribution explicit. Citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses both question parts: connection of missed dose to seizure, and specific transcript evidence (P-9) of patient's recognition. No off-topic content."
