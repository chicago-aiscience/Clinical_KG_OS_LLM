  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript ends at [P-28] and lacks concluding remarks. The source transcript clearly continues to [D-33], where the doctor states the plan to pass information to another physician. Furthermore, it incorrectly states the patient saw a doctor for 'this issue' (chest pain) eight years ago, when the transcript and Gold Answer clarify the pain is new and the previous visit was for anxiety attacks. It also mentions a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 100% of the first part of the question regarding the doctor's plan. Regarding clinical information, it misses all pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer (e.g., no trauma, no fevers, no asthma, no palpitations, no family history of arrhythmias) and the specific detail that the pain is relieved by distraction.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is unfaithful to the provided text as it claims the transcript was truncated when the full text was present. The reference to a 'Knowledge Graph' is a hallucination of an external source not provided in the context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. It fails to address the first half of the user's multi-part question due to the error regarding the transcript length, focusing only on the clinical information gathered."
