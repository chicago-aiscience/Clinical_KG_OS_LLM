    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all major components: chest X-ray and COVID swab as diagnostic tests, physical chest examination, self-isolation instructions including staying away from wife, 24-48 hour timeline, public health nurse contact, and results-based disposition criteria. All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-37].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all five requested components: diagnostic tests (chest X-ray, COVID swab), physical examination (chest exam), self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate as much as possible), timeline (24-48 hours), and disposition criteria (based on results). It also correctly identifies the public health nurse's role. Coverage is comprehensive at approximately 95-100% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-37] and [D-38]. The answer accurately quotes and paraphrases the doctor's statements without adding unverifiable information. Citations are accurate. No hallucinated content detected.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the multi-component question about the management plan. It systematically covers diagnostic tests, physical examination, self-isolation instructions, timeline, and admission criteria. No irrelevant information included. The brief mention of the knowledge graph connection to COVID diagnosis is tangential but minimal."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent, comprehensive response that accurately captures all components of the doctor's management plan as documented in the transcript. It correctly identifies the diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), the planned physical chest examination, specific self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife), the 24-48 hour timeline for results, the public health nurse's role in positive cases, and the results-based criteria for hospital admission versus discharge. All information is faithfully grounded in the transcript with accurate citations, and the response directly addresses every aspect of the multi-part question without irrelevant content."
