  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the broad sequence (smoking history, teenage anxiety, recent stress, chest pain onset) but omits key timeline specifics from Gold such as smoking start at age 18 [P-18], escalation to 10 cigarettes/day for past 2 years, reduction a few months ago [P-18, P-14], 8-year gap without anxiety [P-22], father's heart attack timing [P-8, P-30], and anxiety possibly returning [P-22]. It inaccurately attributes causal links (e.g., smoking to teenage anxiety) not stated in Gold and references a non-existent knowledge graph. Core structure is similar, but significant timeline details and relations differ.",
    "completeness": "Covered: smoking history (vaguely), teenage anxiety [P-21], recent academic stress escalation [P-4, P-15, P-16, P-28], chest pain onset ~1.5 weeks ago [P-2], some relations (stress to pain). Missed: precise smoking start/escalation/reduction timeline, 8-year anxiety gap [P-22], father's heart attack details, anxiety return possibility [P-22], pain worse when alone [P-9, P-29], covers ~60% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about smoking reduction [P-14], anxiety history [P-21], stress [P-4, P-15], chest pain details [P-3, P-4, P-6] are verifiable in transcript. However, multiple hallucinations include repeated references to a 'knowledge graph' (not present), links like 'knowledge graph explicitly links studying to chest pain,' and general causal claims (e.g., smoking causing teenage issues) not in transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly traces the requested timeline phases (smoking, teen anxiety, recent stress, chest pain) and discusses relations, closely matching the question; minor off-topic elements include knowledge graph mentions and extra details like treatments."
