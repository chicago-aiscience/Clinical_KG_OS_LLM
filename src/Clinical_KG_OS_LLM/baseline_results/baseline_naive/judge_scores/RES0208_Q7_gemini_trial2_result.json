  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the symptoms it does include. It correctly identifies the timeline for shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, and loss of taste. However, it omits several specific details mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the 'laborious' quality of breathing, weakness, and generalized body aches.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The mention of weakness and reduced appetite from onset. 2) The description of breathing as 'laborious'. 3) Generalized body aches (achy) reported by the patient. 4) The diminished sense of smell noted on the morning of the consultation. It covers approximately 60-70% of the Gold Answer's detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript and correctly cited using patient turn numbers (e.g., P-1, P-4, P-7). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request to reconstruct a timeline and organizes the information according to the requested timeframes (onset, recent, and emerging)."
