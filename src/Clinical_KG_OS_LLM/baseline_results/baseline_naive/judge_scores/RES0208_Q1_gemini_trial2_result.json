  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies several symptoms like loss of taste, dry cough, and fever. However, it incorrectly states the patient 'believes he may be having more [headaches] than usual', which contradicts the transcript (P-11) where he says, 'I don't think I'm getting any more than usual'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses three significant symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: diminished sense of smell (P-6), mild sore throat (P-9), and general weakness (P-2). It also omits the patient's denial of nasal congestion. It covers approximately 60% of the specific symptoms detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations for the points it does include. No outside information or symptoms not mentioned in the text were added, although the headache frequency was misinterpreted.",
    "relevance": "The response follows the categorical structure requested. It includes 'General malaise' which is essentially 'fatigue/rundown', a symptom the prompt specifically asked to go beyond, making that section slightly redundant."
