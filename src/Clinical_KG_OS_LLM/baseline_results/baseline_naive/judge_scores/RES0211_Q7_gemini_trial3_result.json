  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the symptoms and the general timeframe. However, it fails to specify the internal sequence of the initial symptoms; the transcript and Gold Answer state the scratchy throat was first, followed by the cough, whereas the generated answer groups them together. It also infers that the hot sensation was 'concurrent,' while the Gold Answer correctly notes that the transcript does not specify the exact day it began relative to the others.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer, specifically the symptoms of general malaise ('feeling crappy') and fatigue. It also omits the specific details about the patient wearing shorts/tank tops to cope with the heat and the summary of the progression from localized to systemic symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is generally faithful to the transcript. However, it claims the hot sensation 'likely began alongside' the initial symptoms as a 'concurrent' state, which is an inference/hallucination as the transcript does not explicitly establish the start day for that specific symptom.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the question regarding the order of symptoms and the relationship of the heat sensation to the timeline, following the prompt's structure well."
