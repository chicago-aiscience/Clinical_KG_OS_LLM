  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It asserts the transcript lacks doctor dialogue ([D-X]) and therefore the plan/assessment cannot be determined; however, the transcript clearly includes extensive doctor dialogue and specifically the end-of-visit summary and plan in [D-47] (“I will go review your story with the doctors”). It also misstates clinical details: it summarizes cough duration as “approximately one month,” whereas the history and the doctor’s summary indicate cough for ~3 months with worsening in the last ~3 days. It introduces an unsupported “knowledge graph” assessment and associated symptom correlations not present as such in the transcript. Overall, it contradicts key source content and misses the doctor’s explicit plan and assessment.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer key points include: (1) doctor’s end-plan to review the story with supervising doctors ([D-47]); (2) summary assessment: cough for a while (~3 months) worse last 3 days, nighttime awakening, green sputum, no blood, no constitutional symptoms ([D-47]); (3) next steps guided by supervising physician review; (4) no specific tests/treatments ordered; (5) patient’s add-on (exercise interference) and doctor’s response (“We’ll see what we can do” [D-48]). The Generated Answer includes none of these plan/assessment/next-step elements and instead claims they are not available. Thus it covers essentially 0% of required points.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is not grounded in the transcript: it incorrectly claims there are no doctor segments and that only [P-1]–[P-23] are provided, despite the full transcript including many [D-] turns up to [D-48]. It also adds a “knowledge graph” and relationship claims (cough associated with fatigue/sleep disturbance/chest pain) as structured outputs not present in the transcript, and misrepresents duration. These are major unfaithful statements.",
    "relevance": "It partially addresses the question by attempting to comment on plan/assessment/next steps, but mainly refuses to answer on an incorrect premise and then provides tangential/inappropriate content (knowledge graph) rather than the requested end-of-consultation plan and assessment. Therefore it is only weakly relevant."
