  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and omissions. It fails to mention the breathing difficulty that started 'yesterday' (one day before consultation), which was the most concerning symptom to the patient [P-8, P-9]. It incorrectly states loss of smell as 'not really' when the patient explicitly said they had NOT lost smell [P-19]. It places muscle aches and fatigue in 'Current Status' when they actually started 'immediately after' the sore throat [P-26]. The taste loss timing is missing (two days ago [P-20]). The breathing difficulty timeline is completely absent, which is a critical factual error.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only about 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions: (1) sore throat onset at 4 days, (2) worsening severity, (3) swallowing difficulty, (4) taste changes, (5) muscle aches/fatigue. However, it completely omits: (1) breathing difficulty starting yesterday and worsening, (2) breathing being constant and most alarming, (3) specific timing of taste loss at 2 days, (4) timing of muscle aches as 'immediately after' sore throat, (5) the four-day progressive trajectory with symptoms accumulating. The most critical omission is the breathing difficulty, which was a major concern for the patient.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains hallucination and misrepresentation. It incorrectly states the patient lost smell ('not really') when transcript shows 'No' to smell loss but 'maybe taste a little bit' [P-19]. It creates a misleading timeline structure that doesn't accurately reflect the transcript. The muscle aches timing is misplaced - the transcript shows they started 'immediately after' sore throat [P-26], not as a current status item. The knowledge graph reference about Mono and COVID-19 appears to be extrapolation not directly stated in the transcript dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the chronological question but does so poorly. It creates timeline sections but fails to properly sequence the symptoms. The structure ('Initial Onset', 'Symptom Progression', 'Current Status') doesn't accurately reflect the day-by-day progression requested in the question. The answer includes some relevant information about symptom severity changes but misses the critical breathing difficulty entirely, which was a key part of the chronological development the question asked about."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. Most critically, it completely omits the breathing difficulty that started yesterday and was worsening, which was the patient's most concerning symptom and a key part of the chronological progression. The answer contains factual errors (incorrectly stating smell loss), misplaces timing of symptoms (muscle aches), and fails to provide the clear day-by-day progression requested. While it captures some elements like the sore throat onset and progression, the missing and incorrect information substantially undermines its accuracy and completeness. The answer scores poorly on correctness (2/5) due to major omissions and errors, completeness (2/5) for covering only half the key points, faithfulness (2/5) for hallucinations and misrepresentations, and relevance (3/5) for attempting but failing to properly address the chronological sequence question."
