  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core factors (family history, smoking, and stressors). However, it contains a significant misinterpretation of [P-21]; it claims the patient hasn't seen a doctor in eight years due to family worry, whereas the transcript specifies she hasn't seen a doctor *for anxiety* in eight years. It also attributes her fear of 'a heart thing' directly to smoking in its illustrative evidence for section 2, whereas in the transcript [P-8], that specific quote is more directly linked to her father's heart attack.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: the grandfather's accidental death (explaining why further history is unknown), the father seeing 'heart doctors', the specific duration and start age of smoking (18 years old, 10/day for 2 years), her living situation (living alone in London), and specific physiological connections like breathing faster during episodes [P-19].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript. However, the claim that her 8-year absence from the doctor was 'likely due to this lingering family worry' is an unsupported inference/hallucination. Additionally, referencing a 'knowledge graph' is meta-commentary not found in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, structuring its answer to directly address each part of the multi-part question, including the request for mechanisms of interaction and illustrative evidence."
