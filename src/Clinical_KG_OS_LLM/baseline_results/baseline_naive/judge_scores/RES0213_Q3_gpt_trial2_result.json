  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s main diagnosis (“Anxiety”) is broadly consistent with the Gold Answer’s conclusion of anxiety-/stress-induced chest pain. It correctly cites that symptoms occur during studying/walking to school [P-4] and that the patient has prior anxiety attacks [P-21] and considers stress as a cause [P-8]. However, it introduces unsupported/overstated reasoning (e.g., implying a “Knowledge Graph” causal relationship and that reading non-school books mitigates the chest pain), and it leans on lack of analgesic response as evidence of psychosomatic pain, which is not part of the Gold Answer’s rationale. These issues are secondary to the core diagnosis being correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer supports include: (1) situational pattern with improvement when distracted/with people [P-9, P-29]; (2) past anxiety attacks and concern they may return [P-21, P-22]; (3) explicit current academic/time-crunch stress [P-13, P-15, P-16]; (4) anxiety physiology/hyperventilation during episodes [P-19]; (5) patient explicitly suspects stress [P-8]; (6) pertinent negatives (no fever [P-12], no exertional worsening [P-10], occurs at rest [D-11/P-11], no palpitations except during anxiety [P-20], no asthma [P-23/P-24]). The Generated Answer covers (2) and (5) and part of (3) and notes studying/walking (but does not clearly highlight the key ‘resolves with distraction/social interaction’ pattern from [P-9, P-29]). It omits (4) and most pertinent negatives in (6), and it does not mention the thesis/time-crunch details. Overall coverage is partial (~half of the Gold rationale).",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated references to a “Knowledge Graph” and specific asserted relations (e.g., “studying causes chest pain,” “smoking causes heart attack”) are not present in the provided transcript. Also, claiming that reading non-academic books “helps mitigate the symptoms” is not stated; the patient describes reading as a stress-management strategy [P-28], not as a demonstrated reliever of chest pain. These constitute multiple hallucinated/unverifiable details, even though many other cited points are transcript-supported.",
    "relevance": "The answer generally addresses the question by proposing an anxiety-related diagnosis and attempting to cite supporting consultation observations. It is somewhat weakened by tangential/irrelevant “Knowledge Graph” content, but it remains mostly focused on diagnosing anxiety-related chest pain."
