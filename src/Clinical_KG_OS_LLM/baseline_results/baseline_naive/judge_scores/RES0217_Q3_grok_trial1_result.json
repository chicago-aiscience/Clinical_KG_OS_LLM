  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts (exposure history from P-1, duration >72 hours from D-6, prior history from P-3, no current rash, not deer tick) are fully consistent with both the Gold Answer and transcript; no factual errors or contradictions, though it interprets prior history as a key 'trigger' alongside duration, which aligns with Gold's 'converging factors' without contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) exposure history (hiking Fri/gardening Sat, uncertain timing) - covered; (2) tick duration (>72h) - covered; (3) geographic risk (Strathroy, map check, concerning) - completely missed; (4) prior history (10y ago tick bite, bullseye rash, antibiotics) - covered; (5) despite not deer tick/no rash - partially covered; (6) patient comment on all ticks carriers - missed; (7) send tick to lab/safer prophylaxis - implied but not detailed. Covers ~60-70% (3 main of 4 specified in question).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable in transcript via accurate citations (P-1, D-6, P-3); 'knowledge graph' reference not in transcript (unverifiable/hallucinated addition); phrasing 'triggered the decision' interpretive/plausible from context (duration emphasized D-6/D-18, prior noted P-3/D-6) but not explicit; mostly grounded with minor issues.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses core question on combination of factors leading to prophylaxis despite non-deer tick/no rash; lists 3 of 4 specified elements (exposure, duration, prior history) with citations; omits geographic risk but stays focused without off-topic content."
