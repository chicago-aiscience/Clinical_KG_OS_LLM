  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. The doctor *did* systematically explore exposure sources: living situation (apartment, alone) [P-45], home/environmental triggers (old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets) [D-46]/[P-46], sick contacts [D-47]/[P-47], workplace and whether coworkers were sick (car dealership; anyone sick at work) [P-48], [D-50]/[P-50], and travel history [D-49]/[P-49]. The Generated Answer explicitly claims these were not asked, which directly contradicts the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers essentially none of the key exposure-source elements required by the question and listed in the Gold Answer (living situation, environmental exposures, sick contacts, workplace context, travel). It instead focuses on COVID testing/isolation and contact tracing mention, which is not the requested exposure-history content. Key points missed: apartment living alone; environmental triggers; contact with sick individuals/lunch room; car dealership workplace; asked if anyone at work was sick; no travel; plus the Gold Answer’s mention of substance use screening.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not grounded in the transcript. It asserts that the doctor did not ask about living situation, work, travel, or sick contacts, but these questions are clearly present ([P-45], [D-46], [D-47], [P-48], [D-49], [D-50]). This is a major contradiction, amounting to multiple hallucinated/unsupported claims about what was not discussed.",
    "relevance": "It is loosely on-topic (it attempts to address whether exposures were explored), but it fails to provide the requested list of explored exposure sources and instead pivots to COVID testing and isolation. Because it does not answer the actual content requested, relevance is only partial."
