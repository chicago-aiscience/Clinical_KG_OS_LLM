  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: The Generated Answer states the patient is using moisturizing creams for eczema currently ('regular cream', eczema 'not bad') and previously prescribed treatments for bad flares, citing [P-23] accurately. These facts fully align with the Gold Answer's description of current moisturizing creams and prior prescription creams from family doctor. No contradictions or errors in presented facts; the emphasis on these being treatments is consistent. Thus, all facts are fully consistent with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Explicitly not taking any medications currently [P-29]; 2) Eczema history with current regular moisturizing creams [P-23]; 3) Previously prescribed cream for bad eczema [P-23]; 4) No drug allergies or reactions [P-28]; 5) Possible minor cat allergy, no meds [P-27]; 6) Condoms for contraception, no hormonal BC [P-45]; 7) Marijuana vape ~every 2 weeks [P-36,P-37]; 8) Alcohol ~5-6 beers on weekends [P-41,P-42]; 9) No OTC cough remedies/inhalers/antibiotics. Generated covers only 2 and 3 (eczema current/prev). Misses the explicit 'no medications' (central to current status), allergies, contraception, substances, and no OTC note. Covers approximately 20-25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [P-23]: 'moisturizing creams', 'regular cream' currently as eczema 'not bad', and family doctor previously prescribing cream 'to go get at shoppers' when 'really bad'. No additional unverifiable details, hallucinations, or inaccurate citations. Fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying current (regular cream for eczema) and previous (prescribed treatments for flares) medications/treatments and specifying current status (eczema not bad). Content is entirely focused on relevant patient history from the transcript, with no tangents or off-topic information."
