{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the quality of the pain ('very sharp', 'strong', worsened by deep breaths) and the duration (20 minutes). However, it suggests that physical exertion (running) may be a trigger, which contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer where the patient explicitly says it doesn't seem to get worse with exercise and the walking stays the same [P-10].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. Most importantly, it completely omits the situations in which the pain 'resolves,' a specific requirement of the prompt. It also misses the distinction between being alone versus being with others/preoccupied.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is mostly grounded in the transcript. However, the claim that running 'suggests physical exertion may be a trigger' is a weak inference that leans toward hallucination given the patient's statement in P-10 that they don't think it gets worse with exercise.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant to the questions of quality, duration, and occurrence, but it fails to address the 'resolve' part of the multi-part question asked in the prompt, making it only partially relevant to the full scope of the request."
