  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer accurately lists multiple specific negative findings from the transcript (e.g., no fever [D-10/P-10], no dyspnea [D-11/P-11], no sore throat [D-13/P-13], etc.) with citations and explains their clinical significance. Generated Answer falsely claims 'no documented negative findings' for these symptoms and asserts the transcript does not include patient answers denying them, directly contradicting the explicit denials in the transcript (D-10 to D-15, D-22, etc.) and the Gold Answer. No facts align; it misrepresents the transcript entirely.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Lists 9+ specific negatives (fever, dyspnea, headaches, sore throat, chills/night sweats, muscle aches/weakness, chest pain, sputum/blood, cough triggers) with citations; D-16 summary; clinical explanation of absences; PMH negatives. Generated covers 0% of these, instead denying their existence and listing unrelated positives (anosmia, ageusia, dry cough).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims negatives like fever, dyspnea, sore throat are undocumented, but transcript explicitly has patient denials (P-10: no fevers; P-11: no difficulty breathing; P-13: no sore throat; etc.). It hallucinates absence of review-of-systems data, cites only P-1 incorrectly for positives, and fabricates that clinical picture excludes negatives. All major claims unverifiable or contradicted by transcript.",
    "relevance": "Question requires listing absent symptoms/conditions screened (negatives from ROS) and explaining their impact on clinical picture. Generated denies any negatives exist in transcript, pivots to positives and COVID consistency without addressing absences, thus largely off-topic and failing to answer the core request."
