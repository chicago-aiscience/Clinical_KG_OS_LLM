  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures that the patient is not taking any current prescribed medications (implied across sections, matching P-23), provides correct details on dietary management for acid reflux (P-22, P-25), notes no current anxiety treatment (P-22), and no cough medications with patient inquiry (P-35). Minor discrepancies include omitting the specific detail of stopping anxiety medication 2-3 years ago (P-24), not mentioning hay fever/allergies (P-27), and adding COVID-19 test details (P-35) which are factual but not emphasized in Gold as a core condition/treatment.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: no prescribed meds overall (implied), dietary management for acid reflux with specifics and outcome (P-25), no anxiety meds current, cough symptom details and request for meds (P-35). Missed: explicit prior anxiety medication history (P-24), hay fever with no treatment (P-27), doctor's plan indicating no cough meds prescribed yet (D-37), and the Gold's summary of zero medications across all conditions. Covers approximately 70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., P-22 for conditions, P-25 for reflux management, P-5/P-15/P-35 for cough, P-35 for COVID test). No hallucinations; even the mention of 'knowledge graph' does not introduce ungrounded facts.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses current medication and treatment status by condition (acid reflux diet, no meds for anxiety/cough), fulfilling the question's focus including acid reflux specifics. Minor tangent in COVID-19 section, which is related but not central to treatment status across conditions."
