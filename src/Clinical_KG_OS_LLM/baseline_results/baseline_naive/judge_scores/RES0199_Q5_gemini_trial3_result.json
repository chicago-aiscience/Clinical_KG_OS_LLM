    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that the doctor did not explore living situation, workplace environment, travel history, or contact with sick individuals, and claims these questions were not asked. In reality, the transcript shows the doctor asked about living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48], travel [D-49], and sick coworkers [D-50].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to include any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific details about the apartment, the car dealership, the lunchroom contact, the lack of travel, and the substance use screening.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the transcript. It claims that specific questions regarding exposure were not discussed, which is directly contradicted by multiple turns in the source text (D-45 through D-50). It hallucinates a lack of content that is clearly present.",
    "relevance": "While the generated answer attempts to address the question, it provides a false negative. It fails to provide the specific information requested because it incorrectly concludes that the information does not exist."
