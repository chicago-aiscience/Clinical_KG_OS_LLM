  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately lists reported symptoms (dry cough worsening, fever ~100-101°F on Friday, fatigue, decreased appetite, possible taste loss, mild runny nose, uncertain SOB) with citations and comprehensive pertinent negatives including explicitly denied wheezing [P-7], chest pain/heart racing [P-13], sore throat [P-14], chills/night sweats [P-19], GI issues [P-22/P-23]. Generated Answer partially covers reported symptoms (cough, fever, fatigue, appetite/taste loss) but misses runny nose and SOB uncertainty; critically errs by claiming none of the specific symptoms (wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, GI) were explicitly asked/denied, contradicting transcript evidence of direct inquiries and denials earlier in dialogue (D-7/P-7, D-13/P-13, D-14/P-14, D-19/P-19, D-22/P-23), representing significant factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: cough [partial], fever, fatigue, appetite/taste loss; missed: runny nose [P-16], SOB uncertain [P-8]; denied symptoms completely missed (sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain, sore throat, chills, skin changes, GI, etc.), instead incorrectly stating none of examples denied and listing irrelevant later inquiries; covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms mostly grounded with accurate citations (P-1, P-2, P-17); however, major hallucination/misreading: claims specific symptoms (wheezing etc.) not explicitly asked/denied, directly contradicting transcript (e.g., D-7/P-7 'No' for wheezing, D-13/P-13 'No' for chest pain, etc.); misattributes inquiries to D-44 (later summary) instead of earlier specific questions; multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Structure directly mirrors question (reported respiratory/systemic symptoms, then symptoms explicitly asked/denied); minor tangent on later D-44 inquiries but focused on query without off-topic content."
