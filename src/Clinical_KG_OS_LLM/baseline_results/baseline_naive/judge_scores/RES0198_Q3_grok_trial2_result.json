  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer aligns with Gold on core facts like clear discharge [P-5], duration of one week [P-1, P-2], and doctor's conclusion of viral/common cold [D-39], but has minor discrepancies: simplifies symptom type without detailing absent features (e.g., no cough [P-4], no fever [P-7]); inaccurately claims doctor 'identified these specific symptoms as hallmarks'; mischaracterizes allergies as 'sudden acute' vs. viral 'chronic'; omits progression [P-3] and specific anti-allergic/bacterial evidence; introduces unrelated 'knowledge graph'. Core facts correct despite these.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: symptom type (basic stuffy/runny [P-1, P-3]) partial; discharge quality (clear [P-5]) full; duration (one week constant [P-1, P-8], few weeks [D-39]) full. Missed: absent features details (no cough [P-4], no sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills [P-7], no post-nasal drip [P-6]); symptom progression [P-3]; against allergic (no exposures [P-22], no allergies [P-28], no recent priors [P-9]); against bacterial (no fever [P-7], no headache [P-14]); exposure (nephew daycare [P-11]). Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: symptoms [P-1, P-3], clear discharge [P-5], duration [P-1, D-39], doctor's conclusion/supportive care/swab [D-39]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph' corroboration (absent from transcript); allergies as 'sudden acute' vs. viral chronic (not stated); implication of absent severe symptoms for bacterial/COVID without citing denials [P-4, P-7 etc.]; plausible but some claims not directly in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses evidence for viral over allergic/bacterial via symptoms, discharge, duration; includes relevant COVID context [P-1, D-39]; structured response matches question focus on characteristics; minor tangent on COVID swab but on-topic; misses explicit absent features/exposure but overall focused."
