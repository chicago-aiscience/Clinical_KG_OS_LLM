  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the sequence of the main symptoms (cough, red spots, fever). However, it misinterprets 'over the last day' as Wednesday instead of Tuesday, and 'last two days' (relative to Wednesday) as Monday and Tuesday instead of Tuesday and Wednesday. It also omits the earliest symptom mentioned in the gold answer (runny nose) and the specific description of the sputum (yellow custard).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the gold answer: the runny nose about a week prior, the 'yellow custard' color of the sputum, and the sore throat. It covers the major respiratory and systemic symptoms but lacks the granular detail of the initial onset found in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is mostly faithful to the transcript, but it hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source material. The symptom-day mapping is mostly grounded in the text, though the temporal logic is slightly flawed.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, following the requested timeline structure and addressing the progression of the illness as asked in the prompt."
