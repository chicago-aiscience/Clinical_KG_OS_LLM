  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding the exposure history, the attachment duration (>72 hours), and the patient's prior history of a bullseye rash. It accurately reflects the doctor's eventual decision to provide prophylaxis despite the absence of a current rash or confirmed deer tick species.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses one of the four specific components requested in the question: the geographic risk assessment. The gold answer includes the mention of Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, which the doctor explicitly cited as a reason for proceeding with antibiotics. The generated answer only covers three of the four requested areas.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The details about the 72-hour threshold and the 10-year prior history are accurately captured from the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's focus on the clinical reasoning for prophylaxis, although it fails to include all specific categories requested (missing geographic risk)."
