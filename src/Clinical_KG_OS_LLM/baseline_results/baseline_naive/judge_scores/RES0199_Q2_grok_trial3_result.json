  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states patient took Tylenol for headache relief with specific citations [P-3,P-4]; Generated correctly identifies Tylenol for headache but vaguely references 'persistent condition' and introduces 'knowledge graph indicates' which is not in Gold or transcript. Doctor recs match on supportive measures and Tylenol/anseads (NSAIDs) for aches/fever, but Generated misinterprets 'anseads' slightly (though analgesics is reasonable). Misses Gold's explicit 'no prescription meds' and test/isolation, but core facts consistent with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covers: Tylenol for headache (yes); supportive measures (hydrated, nutritious food, sleeping well - yes); Tylenol for fever (yes); Tylenol/anseads for aches (yes). Misses: patient's self-hydration efforts [P-30] as home measure; explicit 'no prescription meds'; COVID swab test and 14-day isolation [D-52] as key management plan elements. Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Tylenol mention verifiable [P-3]; headache from transcript; supportive measures and meds verifiable [D-52] with accurate citations. 'Anseads (analgesics)' grounded in transcript 'anseads' (likely NSAID typo). However, 'knowledge graph indicates Tylenol targets' is hallucinated/not in transcript and implausible in context. Minor unverifiable detail overall.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around patient's home medication/symptom and doctor's additional recommendations/supportive measures, perfectly matching question structure with no off-topic content."
