  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that the nature of the cough, frequency of diarrhea, number of vomiting episodes, and headache severity were not provided in the transcript. However, the transcript clearly specifies: a 'dry cough' [P-12], 'five or six times a day' for diarrhea [P-28], 'two times' for vomiting [P-32], and a '7' out of 10 for headache severity [P-8].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific characteristics of the symptoms (dryness of cough, frequency of stools, number of vomiting episodes, and pain score) which were the central part of the prompt's request.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It claims information is missing when it is present. This indicates a failure to process the full text provided, as it only seems to acknowledge information from the very first patient turn [P-1].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. While it identifies the symptoms mentioned in the initial complaint, it fails to address the specific details requested by the prompt, incorrectly concluding that those details are unavailable."
