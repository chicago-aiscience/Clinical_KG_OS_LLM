  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims that the transcript consists exclusively of patient responses and contains no doctor dialogue, which is demonstrably false as the provided transcript contains 33 doctor turns (D-1 through D-33). Consequently, it fails to identify any of the conditions or lines of inquiry present in the text.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not identify traumatic injury, cardiac disease, infectious illness, asthma, dyspnea, or arrhythmia syndromes, nor does it describe any of the doctor's screening questions.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinated that the source transcript was missing the doctor's dialogue. The claim that only patient turns [P-1] through [P-28] were provided is directly contradicted by the 'Source Transcript' section of the prompt.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. Instead of providing the requested clinical analysis, it provides a meta-commentary on why it supposedly cannot answer the question based on a false premise about the source text."
