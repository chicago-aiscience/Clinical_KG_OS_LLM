  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies the nephew attending daycare (P-11) as the specific potential infectious exposure source from social history, noting daycare as a common source of respiratory viruses despite the nephew not being sick (P-12), which aligns with the viral URI assessment (D-39). The Generated Answer incorrectly states no specific source was identified in the transcript and instead attributes exposure to the general 'pandemic' context (D-39), missing the key social history detail entirely. It also inaccurately implies the doctor linked diabetes directly to increased infection risk and swab decision due to immune compromise, whereas Gold notes no explicit link in the transcript. External 'knowledge graph' references are not verifiable in the transcript. These are significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: nephew in daycare/living with patient (P-11), possible exposure despite not sick (P-12), diabetes since age 7/on insulin/sees endocrinologist (P-23-P-26), no explicit diabetes-infection link, additional negatives (meds/allergies/hospitalizations), symptoms for a week. Generated covers diabetes partially (P-23) and symptoms (P-1), but completely misses the nephew/daycare exposure source (core to question), daycare risks, and notes no explicit link; adds extraneous pandemic/swab/isolation details not central to Gold. Covers roughly 20-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims are partially grounded: cites P-1, P-23, D-39 accurately for symptoms, diabetes, pandemic/swab. However, multiple hallucinations: 'knowledge graph/KG' for diabetes immune effects (not in transcript), pandemic as explicit 'exposure source' from social history (it's general context), doctor's swab/isolation specifically due to diabetes vulnerability (inferred, not stated; doctor swabs due to pandemic symptoms overlap). Doctor does not tie diabetes to presentation risk. Unverifiable external assumptions.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly attempts to address exposure source (though incorrectly as pandemic) and diabetes relation to presentation (immune risk, influencing swab/isolation), mirroring question structure. Minor tangents into full management plan and Covid suspicion, but stays mostly on-topic without major off-topic content."
