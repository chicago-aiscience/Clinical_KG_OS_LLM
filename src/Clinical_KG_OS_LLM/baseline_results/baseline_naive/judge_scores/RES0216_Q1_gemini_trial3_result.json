  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several significant factual errors. It claims the transcript does not contain information on fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, cough, anxiety, or sweating, whereas the transcript shows the patient explicitly denying each of these (P-6, P-11, P-12, P-13, P-14, P-15). Additionally, it states there are no upper airway symptoms, missing the patient's report of hoarseness, phlegm, and throat clearing (P-11).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the majority of the key points in the Gold Answer. It misses almost all the pertinent negatives (denied symptoms) requested by the question and misses the specific upper airway symptoms (hoarseness, phlegm) reported by the patient.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a lack of information. It claims that specific symptoms (fevers, cough, etc.) cannot be confirmed as denied in the text segment, which is false as they are explicitly addressed in turns D-6 through D-15. This is a negative hallucination (claiming information is absent when it is present).",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address the question's categories (Reported vs. Denied), but because it incorrectly filters out most of the relevant data from the transcript, the content provided is largely insufficient."
