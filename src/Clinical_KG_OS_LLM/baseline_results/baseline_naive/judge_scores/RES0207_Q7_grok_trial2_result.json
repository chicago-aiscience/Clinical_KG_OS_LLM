  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer details evening birthday disruption leading to missed Keppra dose, later night seizure (fine after, bed), morning sudden SOB and dry cough (~3 hours prior to consult), temp check 37.4°C, no prior SOB, decision to seek care due to uncertainty, and mention of seizure with relation uncertainty. Generated accurately states seizure last night (fine after, bed), missed med (Keppra) as likely cause, morning SOB onset upon waking, decision to seek care, morning temp 37.4 mild. No contradictions or false facts; omits birthday reason, cough, 3-hour timing, no prior SOB, relation uncertainty—but all included facts match Gold/transcript precisely. Minor discrepancies in coverage/detail, core sequence correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: (1) evening daughter's birthday disrupting routine/forgot Keppra evening dose; (2) later night seizure, fine after, bed; (3) morning sudden SOB + dry cough; (4) symptoms ~3hrs before consult; (5) morning temp check 37.4°C; (6) never SOB before; (7) decided seek care (unsure cause); (8) mentioned seizure, unsure if related. Generated covers: (2) fully; missed med partial (no birthday); (3) SOB only (no cough); (5) fully; (7) fully. Misses (1),(4),(6),(8), cough. Covers ~50-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: seizure last night, fine after/bed [P-8]; epilepsy [P-8]; forgot med likely cause [P-9]; Keppra [P-23]; woke SOB [P-1]; decided come in [P-1]; temp 37.4 morning [P-5]. Citations accurate. Minor unverifiable: 'knowledge graph information' not in transcript. No hallucinated facts or unverifiable events.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures timeline from evening before (seizure/med) to morning of consult (SOB onset, temp, decision), directly addressing question's scope and specified events (seizure, respiratory symptoms via SOB, temp check, seek care decision). No tangents or irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer offers a factually accurate and highly relevant timeline reconstruction that is grounded in the transcript but incomplete in covering all key details from the Gold Answer, such as the birthday context, cough, and precise symptom timing."
