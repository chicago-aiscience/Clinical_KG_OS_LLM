  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It claims the transcript contains only patient responses and no doctor dialogue, but the transcript clearly includes multiple doctor turns ([D-1] through [D-33]). As a result, it incorrectly concludes the question cannot be answered. It also fails to identify the screened/rule-out conditions that are explicitly present in the transcript (trauma/MSK injury, cardiac/exertional symptoms, infection/fever/sick contacts, asthma, dyspnea, inherited arrhythmia/sudden death screening).",
    "completeness": "It covers essentially none of the Gold Answer key points. It does not list any of the conditions screened for, nor the specific doctor questions used to rule them out. It only provides a generic description of the patient’s HPI and a refusal, which does not match the requested content.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is not grounded in the transcript because it asserts a major falsehood: that there is no doctor dialogue. This is directly contradicted by the provided [D-...] lines. The remainder consists of non-responsive generalizations and does not accurately reflect what the doctor actually asked.",
    "relevance": "The answer does not address the question asked (which conditions were screened out and what questions were used). Instead, it refuses to answer based on an incorrect premise. This is effectively non-responsive to the task."
