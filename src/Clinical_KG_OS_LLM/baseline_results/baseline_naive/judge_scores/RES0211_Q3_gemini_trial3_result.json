  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, fever) and the significance of the absence of other symptoms (sputum, GI issues, joint pain) in supporting a URI diagnosis. It correctly maps these to the patient's statements. However, it introduces external diagnostic reasoning not present in the gold answer (e.g., mentioning arthritis and foodborne illness) and misses the epidemiological link mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two key points from the gold answer: the clinical timeline (3-4 days), which is a standard diagnostic criterion for URIs, and the history of the brother's recent cold, which provides evidence of viral exposure. It also overlooks 'malaise' and 'fatigue' which were part of the gold answer's symptom constellation.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer consistently hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' as the basis for its reasoning, which was not provided in the source transcript or the prompt. While it correctly cites the patient's words (P-codes), the framing of the 'knowledge graph' is an artifact not grounded in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to answer the prompt's question about how the presence and absence of specific symptoms support the doctor's assessment."
