    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that information about Jessica's family history, brother's cold, and farm living situation is not available in the transcript. In fact, all of these details are explicitly documented: father's allergies [P-33], cousin's asthma [P-30], brother's cold a few weeks ago [P-39], and living on a farm [P-43] with homeschooling during COVID [P-41]. This represents a fundamental factual error that contradicts the Gold Answer and the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question entirely. It does not discuss how the various factors (family history, household exposure, living situation) relate to Jessica's current symptoms. Instead, it incorrectly denies the presence of this information and provides only a basic symptom summary. It covers 0% of the key relational analysis provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination by asserting that information is 'not available' when it clearly exists in the transcript. The symptom summary provided is accurate to the transcript, but the core claim about missing information is fabricated and directly contradicts the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question asked. The question specifically asks how multiple factors 'collectively relate' to Jessica's symptoms, but the response refuses to engage with this relational analysis by incorrectly claiming the information doesn't exist. The symptom summary provided, while accurate, does not answer the relational question posed."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally fails on all evaluation dimensions. It incorrectly claims that essential information is not available in the transcript when all referenced details are clearly documented. This factual error prevents any meaningful analysis of how the various factors relate to Jessica's symptoms. The response does not address the question's core request for relational analysis and instead provides only a basic symptom summary after asserting the impossibility of answering due to missing information that actually exists."
