  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly correct but slightly mischaracterizes the lack of prior treatment. It states there is 'no information indicating' the patient tried anything, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer show the patient explicitly stated they had not tried anything. This is a subtle but important distinction in clinical documentation (negative finding vs. missing data). All other facts regarding the swab and isolation are accurate.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary recommendations (COVID swab and isolation instructions) but misses several specific details found in the Gold Answer: the 1-2 day timeframe for results, the mention of potential additional tests, and the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is faithful to the transcript and does not hallucinate information. The mention of 'Knowledge Graph information' is an external reference but does not contradict the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's requirements regarding prior treatments, recommended interventions, and instructions."
