  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly states onset was ~4–5 days prior and that initial symptoms included wheeze and dyspnea/difficulty taking deep breaths (though it incorrectly cites [P-1] for “difficulty taking deep breaths,” which is actually in [P-2]).\n- Correctly identifies exertion (playing tag) as the initial trigger [P-3].\n- The description of the fluctuating pattern is partly inaccurate: it does not clearly capture the core pattern of activity-triggered episodes that resolve with rest and recur with activity [P-6]. It also incorrectly brings in “infections have come and go” as support for fluctuation (that refers to prior viral infections over 2 years, not the current symptom course [P-15]).\n- Cough emergence is correctly described as a more recent symptom [P-1], but it omits that it was non-productive [P-31].\n- Nocturnal episode is misrepresented: it did not occur “during the visit,” but occurred on one prior night; it involved nocturnal wheeziness that resolved on its own and caused trouble falling asleep [P-43, P-44].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered:\n- Timing: 4–5 days. \n- Trigger: exertion/playing tag.\n- Early symptoms: wheeze, dyspnea.\n- Cough emerged later.\n- Mentions trouble falling asleep at night.\n\nKey elements missed or inadequately captured:\n- The central episodic pattern: symptoms recur with activity and resolve with rest/self-resolve [P-6].\n- The nocturnal episode included wheeziness and spontaneous resolution [P-43].\n- Non-productive cough/no phlegm [P-31].\n- Pertinent negatives: no fever, no cyanosis, well between episodes (Gold includes these).",
    "faithfulness": "- Some statements are not well-grounded or are misconstrued:\n  - Using past “infections have come and go” to explain current fluctuation is not supported (misuses [P-15]).\n  - “Severity is described as slightly” is not an accurate characterization of fluctuation (and [P-32] is about breathing difficulty and no cyanosis).\n  - “Absence of cyanosis suggests fluctuating nature” is an unsupported inference.\n  - “Nocturnal episode during the visit” is incorrect (hallucinated timing).\n- Most other points (onset, exertional trigger, cough presence, trouble falling asleep) are supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "- Largely addresses the asked trajectory (onset/trigger, fluctuation, cough, nocturnal event).\n- Minor tangents/misplaced content about prior infections and interpretive statements about cyanosis; otherwise stays on topic."
