  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (cough, transition from mucus to dry) and the chest soreness. However, it incorrectly includes acid reflux as a symptom of the 'two-week illness,' whereas the transcript identifies it as a chronic condition the patient has had for years. It also groups 'flu symptoms' without specifying the sore throat and runny nose mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific details present in the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the specific resolved symptoms (sore throat, runny nose), the frequency of the cough (3-4 times/hour), its spontaneous nature/lack of triggers, and all pertinent negatives (difficulty breathing, fever, nausea, belly pain). It covers approximately 35-40% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. The patient did report acid reflux and chest soreness, though the context of the acid reflux was a chronic condition rather than part of the acute illness.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request for symptoms present and resolved during the illness, though it is less specific than requested by omitting the individual 'flu' components and cough characteristics."
