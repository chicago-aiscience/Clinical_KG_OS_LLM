  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the denied symptoms. It explicitly claims the doctor did not ask about nausea, joint pain, or rashes, whereas the transcript shows these were asked and denied in [D-11], [D-13], and [D-10]. It also incorrectly maps the citation for sputum production to [D-33] and [P-29], which actually refer to family history of eczema and asthma, respectively.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to list the denial of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, joint aches, skin changes/rashes, and difficulty breathing. It also omits 'feeling tired' from the list of reported symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of information by stating the transcript does not show inquiries about nausea, joint pain, or rashes. These are clearly present in the source text. The citations provided for sputum production are completely inaccurate relative to the turn numbers in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant as it attempts to answer both parts of the prompt (reported and denied symptoms), even though the content is largely inaccurate for the second part."
