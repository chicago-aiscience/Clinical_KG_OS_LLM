  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly reflects the clinician’s stated reasoning that (1) the husband’s similar illness makes COVID-19 the first diagnosis to rule out and prompts COVID swabbing, and (2) lack of a flu shot keeps influenza on the differential. However, it adds an unsupported/overstated claim that the patient’s fever/sore throat (via a “knowledge graph”) indicate COVID specifically; in the transcript, those symptoms are non-specific and the doctor’s COVID prioritization is driven more by the household cluster than symptom specificity. Overall clinical direction is correct with a minor factual overreach.",
    "completeness": "Covers the major Gold Answer points: husband’s week-long similar illness implying household transmission; limited outside contact as supporting household spread; no flu shot increasing influenza plausibility; COVID test prioritized with influenza also considered. It is somewhat less specific than the Gold Answer about the exact limited-exposure details (work-from-home, mainly at home, hiking as the only notable exposure, denial of other sick contacts), though it captures the gist.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in cited transcript lines (COVID-first-to-rule-out at D-53; self-isolation advice at D-53/D-54; influenza possibility at D-54; flu shot question/absence at D-53/P-53). The main ungrounded element is the reference to a “knowledge graph” and the implication that fever/sore throat specifically indicate COVID; this is not stated in the transcript and risks mild hallucination/over-interpretation. Otherwise faithful.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers how the epidemiologic factors (husband ill, shared limited-contact household, no flu shot) shape the COVID vs influenza differential, with minimal extraneous content."
