  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core diagnosis and the doctor's reasoning process. However, it fails to mention the 'sputum changes' (transition from clear to yellow) which is one of the three symptoms explicitly listed in the question and detailed in both the transcript and the Gold Answer. All other facts provided are accurate.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers several key points: worsening cough, increased dyspnea, and the linkage to COPD history in [D-52]. It misses the specific detail regarding sputum color changes [P-6], the specific duration of the COPD diagnosis (5 years), and the mention of current medications (Ventolin/Spiriva) which the Gold Answer uses to provide context for the established history.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is fully grounded in the transcript. It accurately quotes the doctor's assessment from [D-52] and the patient's complaints from [P-1]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question. However, by omitting the 'sputum changes'—a symptom the prompt itself highlighted in parentheses—it is slightly less focused on the specific 'combination' requested."
