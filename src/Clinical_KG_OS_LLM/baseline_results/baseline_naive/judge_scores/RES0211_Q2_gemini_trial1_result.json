  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with both the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the medications (Claritin and Deyo) and the past treatment (allergy shots), as well as Jessica's current usage status for each.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific details present in the gold answer. Specifically, it omits 'dosing details' requested in the prompt, such as the three-month regimen for the birth control and the once-a-week frequency for the allergy shots. It also fails to mention that she does not carry an EpiPen and has no medication allergies, which are key parts of her 'medications and carrying' profile.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript. The status of Claritin as 'just in case' and the names of the medications are accurately pulled from the text without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's questions regarding current medications and past treatments. It stays focused on the clinical history provided."
