  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly states no prior treatments attempted by patient, matching Gold's core fact from [P-9], though it phrases as 'no information' rather than quoting explicit denial and omits no regular meds [P-24]; accurately covers COVID test swab and self-isolation instructions with details and citations [D-39]; minor discrepancy in not explicitly noting 'no medication prescribed'; however, hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' alignment not in Gold or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) no self-treatments explicit denial [D-9/P-9] and no regular meds [D-24/P-24] - partially covered as 'no information', misses quotes/cites/no meds; (2) no medication prescribed - implied but not stated; (3) COVID swab test, 1-2 day results [D-39] - covers test but misses timeline; (4) self-isolate until results, potentially longer [D-39] - fully covered; (5) possible other tests/consult [D-40] - missed. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: no prior treatment aligns with [P-9]; COVID test/swab [D-39]; isolation instructions verbatim [D-39]; citations accurate. Minor issue: 'no information' slightly understates direct denial in transcript. Hallucination: 'Knowledge Graph' and 'clinical documentation' not in transcript; 'treatments/procedures associated with covid diagnosis' inferred but extra.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by structuring response into patient's self-treatment (none) and doctor's recommendations (test and isolation with instructions); directly focused with no off-topic content beyond minor closing sentence."
