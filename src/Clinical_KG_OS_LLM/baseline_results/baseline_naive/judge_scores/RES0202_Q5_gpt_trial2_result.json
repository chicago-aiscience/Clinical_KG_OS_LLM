  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript and Gold Answer on the main factual points: (1) the mother suspected school as a possible source (“maybe got covid… at school”) and symptom onset was after returning from school Wednesday; (2) she reported no known sick contacts outside of school; and (3) the school had not contacted them about any exposures. The statement that there were no specific known sick contacts identified at school is consistent with the mother’s comment that it was “kinda hard to say” regarding school-based contacts and that no notification had been received.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: school as suspected source; onset after school; no known sick contacts outside school; uncertainty about school contacts; no school notification of exposures.\nKey points missed: the mother’s added detail that the school required a COVID test for return and so the school could notify others about exposure. (Gold also mentions no travel and no home environmental exposures, but those are ancillary to the question and not essential.) Overall coverage is strong but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript: suspected school/COVID [P-2], timing after school [P-1], no known sick contacts outside school and uncertainty due to school [P-38], and no school contact/notification [P-39]. No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on how school attendance related to suspected source and what was reported about sick contacts and school notifications, which directly addresses the question. Minor omission of the school’s testing/notification policy reduces completeness but not relevance."
