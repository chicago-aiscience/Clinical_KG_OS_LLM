  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s medication for epilepsy (matches P-23, P-8). It is also correct that the patient forgot to take the medication (P-9). However, it adds an unsupported justification (“supported by the knowledge graph”), which is not part of the transcript and therefore is not factually grounded in the provided source.",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer: (1) Keppra for chronic epilepsy; (2) missed dose occurred specifically because it was the daughter’s birthday celebration, the routine changed, and the patient usually takes it with dinner but didn’t have dinner at the usual time; (3) this was an isolated lapse; (4) patient thought missing it contributed to seizure. The Generated Answer includes only (1) and a generic statement of (partial) (2) (“forgot”), but omits the specific circumstance (daughter’s birthday/routine change) that the question explicitly asks for, as well as the other contextual details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (Keppra, epilepsy, forgot dose). The statement about a “knowledge graph” providing support is not verifiable from the transcript and is an extraneous, hallucinated source attribution.",
    "relevance": "The response addresses the medication portion directly, but does not answer the question’s second required element (the specific circumstance that led to the missed dose). It stays on-topic but is only partially responsive."
