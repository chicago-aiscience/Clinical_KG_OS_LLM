  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major elements of the doctor's plan from [D-43] as described in the Gold Answer, including physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab, labs, attending consultation, disposition criteria (labs and vital signs), and clinical impression (COPD exacerbation likely due to infection). Minor omission of the specific tie-in to temperature from earlier dialogue [D-11] and patient agreement [P-43], but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation - yes), diagnostic testing (COVID swab - yes; labs - mentioned under decision criteria), clinical impression (COPD exacerbation by infection - yes), disposition criteria (labs and vital signs - yes), attending consultation (yes). Missed: explicit categorization of labs as diagnostic testing (listed under criteria instead), specific mention of temperature check from [D-11], and patient agreement [P-43]. Covers approximately 85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-43] of the transcript: physical exam ('look at your vitals and listen to your chest'), COVID swab ('covid swab'), labs ('your labs'), vital signs ('vital signs'), attending consult ('talk to my attending'), COPD diagnosis ('COPD exacerbation... infection'). Citations are accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured to directly address the question, with clear sections on examinations/tests, consultations, decision criteria, and clinical assessment, containing no off-topic content."
