  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (taste and dry cough) and the test method (swab). However, it omits 'loss of smell' from its primary bolded list of symptoms, although it appears in the subsequent quote. The Gold Answer lists all three symptoms as the primary drivers.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it does not mention the doctor's systematic exclusion of other symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, etc.) which helped define the 'narrow symptom profile,' nor does it mention the self-isolation instructions mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally grounded in the transcript. However, it references a 'knowledge graph provided' which does not exist in the context provided, suggesting a minor hallucination or template error. All other claims are verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question regarding the combination of symptoms, the connection to the diagnosis, and the test method."
