  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that it is not possible to answer the question because the transcript supposedly lacks doctor turns. This is factually incorrect as the transcript provided includes multiple doctor turns (D-1 through D-38), specifically turn D-37 which contains the exact information requested in the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the auscultation of heart and lungs, the physical exam, the consultation with the supervising physician, or the collaborative process for determining next steps.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination regarding the content of the source text, claiming the transcript consists 'exclusively of patient statements' despite the clear presence of doctor dialogue throughout the provided document.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question entirely, providing irrelevant information about the patient's diet and COVID-19 test results after falsely claiming the requested information was unavailable."
