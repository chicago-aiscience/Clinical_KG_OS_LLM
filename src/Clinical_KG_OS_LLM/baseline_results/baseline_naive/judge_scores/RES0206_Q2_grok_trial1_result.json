  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the two inhalers (maintenance daily, rescue ~q2w) and their frequencies from [P-26], COPD managed with puffers [P-1, P-26], HTN diagnosis [P-22], and no antiHTN meds [P-23], all consistent with Gold and transcript. However, it inaccurately cites [P-1] for rescue frequency (which discusses symptoms, not frequency), lists past referral to lung specialist [P-8] as a current strategy (not emphasized in Gold as ongoing), and erroneously states 'transcript does not provide a specific reason' for no antiHTN meds, contradicting [P-23] where patient explicitly says they discussed meds but opted for lifestyle changes first. These are significant factual errors/misrepresentations compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: COPD inhalers & frequencies (maintenance daily, rescue q2w) [P-26]; no specific names; HTN diagnosis & no meds [P-22, P-23]. Missed: no home oxygen [P-1]; detailed reason for no antiHTN (discussed meds, chose lifestyle incl. weight loss/walking [P-23,24], BP 'OK' [P-23], doc support [D-25]); lifestyle strategies (rare alcohol [P-39], quit smoking [P-40], baseline well-managed except when sick [P-27,28]); no allergies [P-29,30]. Covers ~30-40% of key points, especially misses core 'why no antiHTN' and management strategies.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: puffers/inhalers [P-1,P-26]; HTN [P-22]; no antiHTN [P-23]; frequencies [P-26]. Issues: Incorrect citation of [P-1] for rescue frequency (not there); referral [P-8] as 'strategy' (past diagnosis, not current); false claim 'no specific reason provided for no antiHTN' (directly contradicted by [P-23]). Multiple inaccurate citations and one fabricated interpretation (no reason), indicating hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question: COPD meds/strategies/inhaler frequencies, HTN status/reason for no meds. No off-topic content, directly addresses all question elements despite gaps/errors."
