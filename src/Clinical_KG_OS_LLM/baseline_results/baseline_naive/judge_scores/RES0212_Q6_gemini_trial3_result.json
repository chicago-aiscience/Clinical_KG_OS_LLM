  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the source material. It claims the doctor's dialogue (D-X) is missing and that the transcript only goes to P-23, whereas the provided transcript contains both doctor and patient dialogue up to P-48. Consequently, it fails to provide the doctor's plan, assessment, or next steps found in D-47 and D-48.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the doctor's summary of the greenish sputum, the absence of constitutional symptoms, the plan to review the case with supervising doctors, or the impact of the cough on the patient's exercise.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a major hallucination/error about the structure and content of the provided transcript. It asserts that the text is incomplete and missing the provider's responses, which is directly contradicted by the input text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer does not address the question at all, opting instead to provide a meta-commentary on why it cannot answer based on a false premise about the available data."
