  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: exposure history (hiking/gardening [P-1]), duration >72 hours [D-6], prior history of tick bite with bullseye rash ~10 years ago requiring antibiotics [P-3], no current rash, and tick not visually deer tick [P-5, P-6, D-6]. No factual errors or contradictions, though it summarizes the 'trigger' as duration and prior history without misstating transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertain timing [P-1]) - covered; (2) Tick attachment duration (>72 hours [D-6]) - covered; (3) Geographic risk (Strathroy creek [P-12], map assessment as concerning [D-13]) - completely missed; (4) Prior history (10 years ago, bullseye rash, antibiotics [P-3]) - covered; additional: patient's comment on all ticks as carriers [P-5], lab identification [D-6/D-18] - missed. Covers ~75% of key points (3/4 main factors).",
    "faithfulness": "All specific claims and citations ([P-1], [D-6], [P-3]) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate quotes/context. No fabricated case details. Minor unverifiable addition: 'knowledge graph' not present in transcript, but does not affect core content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing relevant combination of factors (exposure history, duration, prior history) that led to prophylaxis recommendation, notes exceptions (no deer tick resemblance, no current rash), no off-topic or extraneous content."
