  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the set of symptoms reported by the mother. However, it identifies only 'wheezy' as the earliest symptom based on P-1, whereas the gold answer and transcript P-2 indicate that 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' was also noticed at the same time as the initial symptom.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the main symptoms (wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, out of breath). It misses a few supporting details included in the gold answer, such as the fact that the cough was non-productive (no phlegm) and that the child appeared otherwise well.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is generally grounded in the transcript. However, the response references a 'Knowledge Graph,' which is not part of the provided source text, representing an artifact of the generation process rather than the transcript itself.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly answering both parts of the question regarding the symptoms at presentation and the timeline of their appearance."
