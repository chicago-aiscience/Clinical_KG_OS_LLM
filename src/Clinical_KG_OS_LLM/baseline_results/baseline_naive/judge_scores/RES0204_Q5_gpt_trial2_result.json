  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly links the clinician’s family-history question to considering asthma risk, and it correctly identifies the patient’s dry cough and runny nose from the transcript. However, it contains a major factual error: it states the transcript does not explicitly mention absence of shortness of breath or wheezing, when the mother explicitly says the child “doesn’t get short of breath or wheezing… even with physical activity” and was “worked up” for asthma [P-28]. It also speculates that chest X‑ray/COVID testing was done to distinguish viral illness from asthma, which is not stated in the Gold Answer and is not explicitly supported by the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) the doctor asked about family history of respiratory problems; (2) current symptoms include dry cough and runny/clear nose. Key points missed: (1) grandparents specifically had asthma; (2) prior asthma workup/negative implication; (3) explicit evidence of no exertional dyspnea and no wheeze; (4) patient’s statement that he has never had a dry cough like this before and prior symptoms were shorter [P-24]. Overall coverage is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s differentiating evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer introduces an external “Knowledge Graph” assertion not present in the transcript. It also incorrectly claims the absence of SOB/wheeze is not explicit in the transcript (it is). The interpretation that ordering a chest X‑ray/COVID swab specifically distinguishes viral presentation from asthma is not directly supported by the transcript. These are multiple ungrounded or contradictory-to-transcript elements.",
    "relevance": "It stays generally focused on asthma family history and symptom-based differentiation, which is what the question asks. However, it fails to use (and even denies) the key differentiating evidence explicitly requested (absence of shortness of breath/wheezing), and adds tangential content (Knowledge Graph, test-order rationale)."
