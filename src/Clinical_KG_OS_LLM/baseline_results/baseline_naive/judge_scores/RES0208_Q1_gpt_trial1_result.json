  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most reported symptoms match the Gold Answer and transcript: loss of taste [P-4], early dry cough with minimal coughing [P-8], generalized aches [P-20], subjective feverishness [P-4], and reduced appetite/low intake [P-4]. However, the Generated Answer mischaracterizes the headache history: the patient said he gets headaches fairly often and is not getting more than usual (though he has had a little) [P-11], whereas the Generated Answer states he believes he may be having more than usual. This is a factual discrepancy, but the core symptom list is otherwise accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer items included: loss of taste, cough, myalgias, subjective fever, decreased appetite/low intake, headaches, and general malaise/rundown feeling.\nKey items missed: diminished sense of smell/anosmia-like change [P-6]; mild sore throat [P-9]; explicit denial of runny nose/nasal congestion [P-10]; and general weakness [P-2]. Overall, this is partial coverage of the full symptom set described in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate citations (taste change, cough, aches, feverishness, appetite). The main faithfulness issue is the headache claim being flipped relative to the transcript (patient said not more than usual). Aside from that, there is no major hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question by listing additional symptoms beyond shortness of breath and fatigue, organized by domain (sensory/URI/musculoskeletal/constitutional), without notable tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate and well-focused but omits several key symptoms (smell change, sore throat, no congestion, weakness) and contains a minor factual error about whether headaches were more than usual."
