  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and perfectly aligns with the Gold Answer regarding the condition (COVID-19), the test (swab), the timeline (48 hours), and the primary instruction (isolation).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components of the question. Compared to the Gold Answer, it omits the secondary instruction that the patient would receive 'further instructions from public health' once results are back, and does not mention the doctor's initial agreement in [D-2], though it captures the later confirmation in [D-39].",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical information provided is directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited. It mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the input, but this is a minor template-related discrepancy that does not impact the clinical accuracy.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and concise, addressing only the components requested in the question without unnecessary fluff."
