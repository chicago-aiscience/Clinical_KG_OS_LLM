  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all OTC products the patient tried for chest discomfort (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and accurately states they were not very helpful, matching [P-6]. It also correctly notes the patient’s only routine supplement is a multivitamin [P-25] and accurately reports running a few times a week [P-28]. No statements conflict with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer tried for chest pain; (2) these were ineffective (“hasn’t really helped very much”); (3) routine multivitamin as only ongoing supplement. Minor omissions relative to the Gold Answer: it does not explicitly restate that the patient takes no other medications (no prescription meds) besides the multivitamin, and it omits the Gold Answer’s additional non-medication context (reading for stress, smoking reduction).",
    "faithfulness": "All included items are directly supported by the transcript: OTC trials and lack of benefit [P-6], multivitamin use [P-25], and usual running frequency [P-28]. No clear hallucinations or unsupported claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer is strongly focused on OTC medications/supplements and effectiveness, which directly addresses the question. The inclusion of running as a 'routine activity' is slightly tangential because the question asks specifically about medications/supplements, but it is minor."
