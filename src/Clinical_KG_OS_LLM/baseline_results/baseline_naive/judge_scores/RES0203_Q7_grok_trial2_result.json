  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that all three symptoms began simultaneously approximately two days prior, aligning with Gold [P-1,P-2], but it inaccurately claims the transcript provides no information on worsening or fluctuation (contradicting patient statements of consistency [P-5,P-8] detailed in Gold), partially addresses history by inferring novelty from [P-1] without the direct denial [P-3], and omits the specific confirmation that cough started at the same time [D-6,P-6]; significant errors in progression details lead to contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: simultaneous onset of all three (with cough confirmation), sensory symptoms consistent/no fluctuation, cough consistent/no worsening, no intermittency, partial sensory losses, no prior history. Generated covers simultaneous onset (partially, missing cough-specific cite) and no prior history (incompletely); misses all progression/consistency details, partial nature of losses; covers ~30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Onset claim grounded in [P-1]; however, assertion of 'no information' on progression/fluctuation is false as [P-5] (consistent sensory), [P-8] (consistent cough) directly contradict; history inference from [P-1] plausible but ignores explicit denial [P-3]; mischaracterizes [D-39] as not discussing progression; multiple ungrounded claims about absence of info.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses onset timeline, progression (though erroneously), and prior history per question; structured response with bullets matches question focus, minor extraneous note on doctor's statement but no major off-topic content."
