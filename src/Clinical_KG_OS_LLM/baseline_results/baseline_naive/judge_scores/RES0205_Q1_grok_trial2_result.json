  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: it incorrectly includes chronic acid reflux (P-22, reported as a longstanding condition) as a current symptom of the two-week illness; mischaracterizes chest soreness associated only with excessive coughing (P-15, P-16) as 'Chest Pain' without noting the denial of independent chest pain; vaguely references 'flu symptoms' (P-14) without specifying sore throat (P-13), runny nose (P-14), or productive mucus details (P-6); omits cough characteristics like frequency (3-4 times/hour, P-9), spontaneity (P-10), and stability (P-7, P-8). Core idea of persistent cough with early resolved symptoms is partially correct, but errors distort the acute illness scope.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: persistent cough (P-2), transition to dry cough after mucus (P-5, P-6), resolved early 'flu symptoms' vaguely (P-14), resolved mucus (P-5), chest soreness with coughing (P-15, P-16 partially). Missed: specific resolved symptoms (sore throat first 2-3 days P-13, runny nose first couple days P-14, whitish clear mucus first 4-5 days P-6, collective flu resolution in 3-4 days P-14); current cough details (since day 4-5, 3-4x/hour P-9, spontaneous no triggers P-10, stable intensity P-7 and frequency P-8); distinction of soreness not independent pain; pertinent negatives (no SOB P-11, no fever P-12, no N/V P-19, no abd pain P-20). Covers roughly 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: cough and mucus timeline (P-2, P-5, P-6), chest hurt with coughing (P-15), flu symptoms resolved (P-14), acid reflux (P-22). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; phrasing like 'chest hurts a little bit' matches transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around symptoms present vs resolved during the two-week illness, addressing the question's core request; minor irrelevance in including chronic acid reflux (not acute illness) and vagueness on flu specifics, but no major off-topic content."
