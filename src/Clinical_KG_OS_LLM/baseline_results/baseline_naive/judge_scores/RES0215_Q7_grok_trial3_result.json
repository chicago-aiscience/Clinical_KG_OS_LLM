    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the onset (4-5 days, P-1), initial symptoms (wheezy, SOB, difficulty breathing), trigger (playing tag, P-3), fluctuating pattern (P-5), emergence of cough (P-1), and nocturnal episode (P-44). However, it has significant factual errors: attributes fluctuating pattern incorrectly to past infections (P-15, not current symptoms as in Gold's P-5/P-6), misinterprets 'slightly' (P-32) as indicating severity fluctuation (P-32 is about straining, not fluctuation), claims absence of cyanosis 'suggests' fluctuating (unsupported interpretation), cites deep breaths to P-1 (actually P-2), and wrongly states nocturnal episode 'during the visit' (Gold and transcript indicate one past night, P-43/P-44). These contradict Gold's accurate depiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: onset (4-5 days), trigger (tag), initial symptoms (wheezy/diff deep breaths), fluctuating/episodic (partially), cough emergence (recent), nocturnal episode (one night, trouble sleep). Missed: detailed fluctuating mechanism (episodes resolve spontaneously, recur with activity/resolve with rest, P-6), cough non-productive/no phlegm (P-31), pertinent negatives (no cyanosis P-32, no fever P-7, fine otherwise P-9). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: onset/trigger/cough from P-1/P-3. But hallucinations/misattributions: past infections (P-15) and 'slightly' (P-32) for fluctuating (not in transcript for current pattern, Gold uses P-5/P-6); cyanosis 'suggests fluctuating' (plausible but not verifiable); deep breaths cited P-1 (actually P-2); nocturnal 'during visit' (fabricated, transcript is history). Multiple unverifiable/misplaced details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question elements (onset, trigger, fluctuating pattern, cough emergence, nocturnal episode) with no off-topic content or tangents."
