  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly groups the scratchy throat and dry cough as the 'initial symptoms' occurring together. In contrast, the Gold Answer (and transcript P-4) explicitly states that the scratchy throat was first, followed by the dry cough. It correctly identifies the headache as a later point in the progression and the persistent nature of the feeling of heat.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several progression symptoms included in the Gold Answer, specifically malaise ('feeling crappy overall') and fatigue. It captures the headache and the sensation of feeling hot but omits the broader systemic symptoms mentioned in the patient's account.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims the sensation of feeling hot 'likely began alongside' the initial symptoms. However, the Gold Answer correctly notes that the transcript does not specify the exact day the heat began relative to the cough/throat onset. While the patient feels hot 'all the time' during the episode, asserting a specific start time 'alongside' the first symptoms is an inference not explicitly stated in the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the order of symptoms and the relationship of the heat sensation to the timeline. It remains focused on the patient's symptoms over the 3-4 day period."
