  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports sudden shortness of breath [P-1], matching the Gold Answer's description; the seizure last night [P-8] aligns perfectly; and the fever measurement of 37.4 [P-5] is consistent, with no factual errors, contradictions, or additions not supported by the Gold Answer or transcript. All stated facts are fully consistent. Score: 5.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: respiratory symptoms include sudden-onset shortness of breath upon waking [P-1] and ~3 hours prior [P-11], sudden cough that morning [D-2, P-2], dry cough no sputum [D-4, P-4]; neurological: seizure previous night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], felt fine after and went to bed [P-8]; fever: 37.4°C that morning [P-5], described as mild [P-5], confirmed morning [D-6, P-6]. Generated covers sudden SOB [P-1], seizure [P-8], and 37.4 [P-5], but completely misses the cough (a second major respiratory symptom), epilepsy diagnosis, post-seizure status, fever details (mild, °C, morning confirmation), and SOB timing detail. Covers approximately 20-49% of key points (core symptoms partially, but one respiratory symptom and details omitted). Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: 'suddenly very short of breath' in [P-1], 'had a seizure last night' in [P-8], '37.4' in [P-5]; citations are accurate; no hallucinated facts, unverifiable details, or fabrications. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly lists the requested respiratory symptom (SOB), neurological symptom (seizure), and fever measurement under clear headings, perfectly matching the question with no irrelevant or off-topic content. Score: 5"
