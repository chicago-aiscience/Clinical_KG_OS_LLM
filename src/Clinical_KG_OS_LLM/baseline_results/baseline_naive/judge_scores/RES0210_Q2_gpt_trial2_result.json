  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the prescribed medication Lipitor and that it is for high cholesterol, consistent with the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not indicate any over-the-counter medications. The transcript explicitly states the patient took Tylenol at home and that it “helps a little bit” [P-14]. Because the question specifically asks for OTC meds and their reported effectiveness, this is a major factual error/omission relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer: (1) Lipitor/atorvastatin for high cholesterol and it is the only prescription med; (2) OTC Tylenol/acetaminophen used for feeling feverish/unwell with partial relief (“helps a little bit”); (3) no other meds mentioned. Generated Answer includes only (1) and misses (2) and therefore cannot report OTC effectiveness. It also does not explicitly capture the patient’s confirmation that Lipitor is the only medication [P-27]. Overall coverage is well under half of the required key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains an ungrounded reference to a “knowledge graph” relationship that is not part of the transcript. More importantly, it states there were no OTC medications mentioned, which directly contradicts [P-14]. This represents multiple faithfulness problems (hallucinated/unsupported content + contradiction of source).",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on medications, indications, and OTC effectiveness, which matches the question. There is minor irrelevant framing (“knowledge graph”), but the core content is on-topic even though incorrect/incomplete."
