  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly identifies fatigue and sleep disturbance as the constitutional symptoms screened for, when these were actually reported by the patient as consequences of the cough. The Gold Answer correctly identifies that the constitutional symptoms DENIED were night sweats, unexplained weight loss, and hemoptysis. The Generated Answer also incorrectly identifies eczema as an exposure risk that helps exclude TB, when eczema is simply a benign skin condition unrelated to TB screening. The Generated Answer completely misses the critical constitutional symptoms and exposure risks that were actually screened for and denied.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: night sweats denial, weight loss denial, hemoptysis denial, sick contacts screening, travel history screening, IV drug use screening, substance use screening, and the clinical significance of these specific screening questions for TB. It only tangentially mentions fatigue/sleep issues and incorrectly presents eczema as relevant to TB screening.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer has multiple issues with faithfulness. While it correctly cites that the patient mentioned fatigue and sleep disturbance [P-19], it misrepresents these as constitutional symptoms screened for (when they were symptoms reported as consequences of coughing). The mention of eczema is factually grounded in the transcript but is irrelevantly applied to TB screening, which represents a misinterpretation of the clinical significance. The answer fabricates the clinical connection between eczema and TB/chronic infection exclusion.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely off-topic. The question specifically asks about constitutional symptoms and exposure risks that were DENIED and how these help exclude serious conditions. The Generated Answer instead focuses on symptoms the patient REPORTED (fatigue, sleep issues) and incorrectly emphasizes eczema. It fails to address the actual screening questions asked by the doctor regarding night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis, travel, sick contacts, and substance use."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misunderstands the question and provides incorrect information. It confuses reported symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance) with constitutional symptoms that were screened for and denied (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis). It incorrectly identifies eczema as a relevant exposure risk for TB screening. The answer misses all the critical screening questions for exposure risks (travel, sick contacts, substance use) that the Gold Answer correctly identifies. The clinical reasoning is flawed, and the answer fails to address what was actually asked about symptoms and risks that were DENIED."
