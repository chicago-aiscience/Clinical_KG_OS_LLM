  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness, 'stuck pretty good'). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the systemic symptoms. It claims the transcript does not contain evidence of screening for fever, joint pain, or headaches, even though these are explicitly discussed in segments [D-7]/[P-7] (joint pain), [D-8]/[P-8] (fever), and [D-19]/[P-19] (headaches). It also incorrectly attributes the patient's 'No' responses in these segments to a screening for drug allergies.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first half of the question (local symptoms) well. However, it completely fails to identify the systemic symptoms requested, providing an incorrect negative claim instead. It misses approximately 50% of the required key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly here by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is present. It also misinterprets the patient's denials ([P-7], [P-8], [P-19]) as being related to drug allergies rather than the specific symptoms asked about in the preceding doctor turns.",
    "relevance": "The first part of the response is relevant. The second part address the question but provides a false negative conclusion, which detracts from the overall utility of the response."
