  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. Most notably, it claims the patient reported 'smell lost' in its parenthetical explanation, while the transcript and the prompt specifically state the patient had reduced taste *without* loss of smell. It also identifies 'difficulty swallowing food' as a primary reason for COVID suspicion, which is a secondary symptom of the sore throat, whereas it misses the primary symptoms of difficulty breathing and muscle aches mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including the patient's difficulty breathing (SOB), fatigue, and muscle aches. It also fails to mention the context provided in the Gold Answer regarding potential exposure at grocery stores/banks, the lack of recent travel, and the status of immunizations.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates information from a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the source transcript. Furthermore, it inaccurately represents the patient's report on smell and taste, stating 'smell lost' when the transcript [P-19] explicitly says 'not smell'.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the specific question about the symptom combination, it fails to correctly interpret the specific condition mentioned in the prompt (reduced taste without loss of smell), instead providing a contradictory explanation."
