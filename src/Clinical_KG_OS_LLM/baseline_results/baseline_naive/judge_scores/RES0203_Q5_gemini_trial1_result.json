  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the patient did not identify a specific external exposure event. In the transcript (P-18) and the Gold Answer, the patient clearly identifies a hiking trip two weeks prior where people brushed by them. This is a significant factual error.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to mention the hiking trip, which is the core 'potential exposure event' requested by the question. It focuses instead on the symptoms, which were only the secondary part of the prompt's requirement.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims that no specific external event was identified in the provided text, which is a hallucination/misrepresentation of the transcript. Transcript segment P-18 explicitly contains this information.",
    "relevance": "While the answer discusses the diagnosis of COVID-19, it fails to address the primary focus of the question: the specific exposure history and how that history connects to the diagnosis."
