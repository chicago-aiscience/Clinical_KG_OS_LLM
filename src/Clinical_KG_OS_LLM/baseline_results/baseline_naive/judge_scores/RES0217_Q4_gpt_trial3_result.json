  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the clinician assessed for erythema migrans (“bullseye/target rash”) and that it was not present (patient describes only localized soreness/redness rather than a target lesion). It also correctly notes the proposed plan to send the tick to a lab for species identification. However, it implies this was the primary/only diagnostic approach, omitting other proposed testing (serology) and evaluation (physical exam), which makes the diagnostic plan description partially inaccurate by omission rather than by direct contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) erythema migrans asked about and absent; (2) sending tick for lab identification. Key elements missed: (1) screening/absence of joint pain; (2) screening/absence of fever/systemic illness; (3) screening/absence of headaches; (4) confirmation patient otherwise well; (5) confirmation no other bites; (6) proposed physical exam; (7) proposed blood work/serology (“titres”); (8) plan to consult supervising physician. Overall, it captures only a small fraction of the clinical features assessed and diagnostic steps proposed.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript: questioning about rash and the patient’s description, and the plan to send the tick to the lab for identification. No clear hallucinated symptoms, tests, or results are introduced. The citation to P-3 for lack of a target rash is plausible though the most direct denial is at P-6; still, the claim remains grounded in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked domains (absent Lyme features and proposed tests) but is substantially underinclusive, failing to address multiple specific clinical features and the full diagnostic workup discussed."
