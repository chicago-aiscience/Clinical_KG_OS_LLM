  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states there is 'no mention' of the grandson, daycare, cold symptoms, travel, or client visits, all of which are clearly discussed in the transcript (P-23, P-24, P-31, P-32). The Gold Answer correctly identifies these details as the core of the response.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the specific points requested in the prompt regarding exposure history. It misses the connection to the grandson and the exclusion of travel and work-related risks, providing only a summary of symptoms instead.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates a major failure in faithfulness by claiming information is absent from the transcript when it is present. This is a form of negative hallucination (denying the existence of provided facts).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant because it dismisses the core components of the question (the specific exposure pathways) to focus on a general symptom summary that the user did not specifically ask for in isolation."
