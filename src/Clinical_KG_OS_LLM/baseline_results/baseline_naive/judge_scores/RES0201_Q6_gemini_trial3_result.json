  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and perfectly aligns with the clinical facts presented in the transcript and summarized in the gold answer. It correctly identifies the assessment of COVID-19 symptoms, the diagnostic tests (swab and X-ray), the initial isolation period, and the condition for continued isolation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers nearly all key points, including the specific tests and isolation rules. It misses two minor contextual points mentioned in the gold answer: 1) the specific clinical reasoning linking the chest X-ray to the patient's difficulty breathing and COPD history, and 2) the doctor's intent to consult with a supervising physician as part of the next steps.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is entirely faithful to the source transcript, with all claims (COVID-19 symptoms, swab, X-ray, isolation protocol) directly supported by speaker D's statements in [D-43]. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to directly address each component of the user's multi-part question without extraneous information."
