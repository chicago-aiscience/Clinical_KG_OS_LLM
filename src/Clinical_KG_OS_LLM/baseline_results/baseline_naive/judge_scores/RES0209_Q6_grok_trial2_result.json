  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab (D-29) and consultation (D-29), aligning with Gold. However, it inaccurately states that the 'specific instruction to change the medication regimen is not explicitly detailed,' contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript (D-43: 'maybe all you need is a little change to your medications'). It infers need from patient symptoms instead of clinician's suggestion, introducing a significant factual error.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: 1) COVID swab (covered); 2) explicit medication change suggestion (D-43), patient only has rescue inhaler, increased use, sports goal (partially covered via inference but misses explicit suggestion, citations, details); 3) consultation with supervising physician/trainee presentation (D-29, D-43; covered but incomplete citation). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "COVID swab verifiable (D-29); consultation verifiable (D-29, though fuller in D-43); medication claim 'not explicitly detailed' is false (directly contradicts D-43), hallucinates absence while citing patient symptoms (P-1); calls clinician 'physician' loosely but D is trainee. Multiple inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the question's specified elements (diagnostic test, medication regimen suggestion, consultation/next steps) with bullet points, no off-topic content."
