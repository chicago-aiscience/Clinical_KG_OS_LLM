  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Claritin as carried 'just in case' for allergies but not currently taken, matching Gold [P-16, P-25]. It accurately notes Deyo as taken for birth control [P-26], aligning with Gold's core fact, though it omits the 'three months' dosing and oral pill clarification [P-27, D-28, P-28]. For past treatments, it correctly states allergy shots in 'some years' [P-16], but misses dosing ('once a week for a little while in winter' [P-20]), no EpiPen [P-21], and seasonal nature without severe symptoms [P-18, P-21]. No factual errors or contradictions, but minor omissions of details present in Gold. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Claritin (carries, not taking, just in case); Deyo (oral contraceptive, three-month pill, not IUD); no med allergies; past allergy shots (some years, weekly in winter), no EpiPen, seasonal allergies without anaphylaxis. Generated covers Claritin fully; Deyo name/indication/status partially (misses dosing/IUD clarification); allergy shots partially (misses dosing, no EpiPen, no allergies context). Misses no med allergies and full shot details/dosing as per question. Covers ~60-70% of key points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Claritin status [P-16, P-25]; Deyo taken [P-25, P-26]; allergy shots in some years [P-16]. Citations accurate to transcript. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around current medications (Claritin, Deyo) with indications/status and past allergist treatments (shots), precisely matching the question's focus on names, indications, and details from conversation. No tangents or off-topic content. Score: 5."
