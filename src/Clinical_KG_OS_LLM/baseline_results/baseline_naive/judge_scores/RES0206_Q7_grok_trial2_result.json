  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the baseline manageability with puffers [P-1], acute worsening over 3 days with increased cough, sputum (green-yellow), hemoptysis, and dyspnea [P-1], progressive worsening [P-1, implied P-2], and fever [P-9], consistent with Gold. No factual contradictions, but minor discrepancies include not emphasizing lifestyle management [P-28], infrequent rescue inhaler use [P-26], detailed exercise tolerance [P-4], explicit 'worst ever' statement [P-3], and prior ED visits without hospitalization [P-5, P-6]; doctor's attribution [D-43] is correct but Gold is more patient-focused.",
    "completeness": "Covers: baseline manageability with puffers [P-1]; 3-day changes (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea) [P-1]; worsening [P-1, P-2]; fever [P-9]; deviation from baseline. Misses: lifestyle management [P-28], rescue inhaler frequency [P-26], specific dog walk details and walking to appt [P-4], explicit progressive worsening quote [P-2], 'worst I've had' [P-3], prior exacerbations worsened by illness with 2 ED visits in 3 years no hospitalizations [P-3, P-5, P-6]. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable: baseline [P-1], changes [P-1], worsening/dyspnea [P-1], fever [P-9], doctor's assessment [D-43], sputum color/hemoptysis [P-1]. Citations accurate (minor note: referral in [P-8] not [P-1]). No hallucinations; interpretations like 'systemic involvement' plausible from fever but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question parts: evolution from baseline (Symptom Evolution section), worsen/improve (dedicated section), severity comparison (dedicated section, though baseline-focused). Directly addresses all query elements with no off-topic content."
