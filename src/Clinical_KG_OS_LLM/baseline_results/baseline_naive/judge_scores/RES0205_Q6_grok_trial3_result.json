  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims it is impossible to answer the question because the transcript contains only patient statements ([P-2] through [P-35]), ignoring the full transcript which includes key doctor statements like [D-37] detailing the plan (physical exam of heart/lungs, consult with supervising doctor, reconvene for next steps) and [D-1]. This is a complete factual contradiction to the Gold Answer, which accurately summarizes these elements. No facts match the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: multi-step plan from [D-37] (auscultation of heart/lungs, quick physical exam), collaborative process (consult supervising physician, review discussion, return to discuss next steps), foreshadowed in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], no diagnosis/meds. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead providing irrelevant patient details on diet ([P-25]) and COVID test ([P-35]).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript excludes doctor turns and consists only of patient statements, which is false as the full transcript includes all [D-x] utterances, especially [D-37]. Patient details cited (diet, COVID test) are verifiable but irrelevant; the core claim about transcript content is fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks for the doctor's stated plan, exam components, and next-steps process. Generated Answer refuses to answer, claims impossibility due to misread transcript, and diverts to unrelated patient history (dietary changes, COVID test), failing to address the question directly."
