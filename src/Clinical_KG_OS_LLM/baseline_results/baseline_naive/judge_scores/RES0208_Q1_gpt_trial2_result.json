  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly includes loss of taste, early/minimal dry cough, generalized myalgias (“overall achy”), subjective feverishness, decreased appetite, and headache presence. However, it misrepresents the headache history: the patient said he did **not** think he was getting headaches “any more than usual” (just “a little bit”), whereas the Generated Answer says he “believes he may be having more than usual,” which is inconsistent with the transcript/Gold Answer. Otherwise, the included items are accurate.",
    "completeness": "Covered: loss of taste; dry/incipient cough; generalized muscle aches; subjective fever; decreased appetite/reduced intake; mild headache. Missed key Gold Answer points: diminished sense of smell; mild sore throat; explicit denial of runny nose/nasal congestion; general weakness; nuance that taste/smell changes were new for him and that headaches were likely usual stress headaches (the Generated Answer also gets this nuance wrong). Overall coverage is partial (~50–75%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript. The main faithfulness issue is the headache claim implying increased frequency/severity, which the patient denied. No major hallucinated symptoms beyond that; omissions do not reduce faithfulness but do reduce completeness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on ‘other symptoms beyond SOB and fatigue’ and organizes them by the requested domains (sensory/URI/musculoskeletal/constitutional) with no substantial tangents."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and well-focused, but it omits several key symptoms/denials (smell change, sore throat, no congestion) and slightly misstates the headache history."
