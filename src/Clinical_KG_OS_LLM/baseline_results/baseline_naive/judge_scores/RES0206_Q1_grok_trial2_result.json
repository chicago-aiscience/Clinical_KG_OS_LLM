  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core respiratory symptoms (increased cough frequency, increased 'green yellowy' sputum production, hemoptysis, worsened dyspnea) and some systemic symptoms (possible fever, sinus pressure) matching the Gold Answer, with correct citations. It correctly identifies cough as most bothersome. Minor discrepancies include: (1) omitting reduced exercise tolerance ('trickier to walk dog' [P-4]) and mild headache [P-14]; (2) labeling high blood pressure [P-22] as an acute systemic symptom of the 3-day worsening, whereas Gold Answer treats it as a comorbidity, not an acute symptom. Core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: increased cough [P-1], increased sputum 'green yellowy' [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], worsened dyspnea [P-1], possible fever [P-9/P-10/P-11], sinus pressure [P-12], cough most bothersome [P-12] (7/9 points). Missed: reduced exercise tolerance [P-4], mild headache [P-14]. Covers ~78% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: dyspnea/cough/sputum/hemoptysis [P-1], fever [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12], high BP [P-22], cough most bothersome [P-12]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by categorizing respiratory and systemic symptoms from the acute 3-day period and explicitly stating the most bothersome symptom (cough), with no off-topic content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful and relevant, with strong correctness on core symptoms but reduced completeness due to missing exercise tolerance and headache, and a minor error in classifying chronic high blood pressure as an acute symptom."
