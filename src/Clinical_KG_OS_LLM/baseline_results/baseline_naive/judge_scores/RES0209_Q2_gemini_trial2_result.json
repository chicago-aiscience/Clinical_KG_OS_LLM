  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medication as a bronchodilator. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the administration method, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions it is a 'puffer' in [D-7] and [P-7]. It also incorrectly claims the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication, missing the specific inquiry in [D-5]: 'do you have one that you take every day no matter what?'.",
    "completeness": "The answer only successfully addresses one out of the three parts of the question (the name of the medication). It fails to provide the administration method and fails to identify the doctor's question about the daily controller medication, claiming these details are absent when they are present.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains false claims about the content of the transcript. It states that certain information (administration method and the question about daily medication) is not provided, which is a direct contradiction of the source text found in segments [D-5], [P-5], [D-7], and [P-7].",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to address each part of the user's prompt. However, its relevance is diminished by providing 'not found' responses for information that was actually present."
