  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript's content in [D-39]: diagnosis as viral infection/common cold with COVID overlap noted; supportive care matches hydration and Tylenol Cold; test as swab with 48-hour results; public health as isolation and follow-up. Minor rephrasing like 'rule in or out' is implied and factual. No contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnosis (viral/common cold, COVID mention), hydration, Tylenol Cold, swab test (48 hours), isolation at home/no contact, public health instructions. Missed: explicit 'most likely', 'few weeks to resolve', 'not much beyond supportive care', 'swab today'. Covers ~85% of details.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims verifiable in [D-39] (diagnosis, hydration, Tylenol, swab for COVID, isolation, 48 hours, public health). [KG] citations are unverifiable/not in transcript (minor hallucination). No major fabrications; 'rule in/out' plausible inference.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question's elements (diagnosis, supportive care, test, public health); no off-topic content."
