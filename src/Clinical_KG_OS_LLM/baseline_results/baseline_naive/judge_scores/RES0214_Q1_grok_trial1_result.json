  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) matching the Gold Answer's core facts and with correct citations from P-1 and P-13; however, while it correctly states the patient explicitly denied the five specified symptoms (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing), it introduces significant factual errors by citing [P-1] for the denials (which only reports positive symptoms), claiming they were 'effectively denied' due to absence in P-1, and ignoring the explicit later denials when directly asked (e.g., P-5 nausea, P-7 neck stiffness, P-8 headaches, P-10 cough, P-24-26 difficulty swallowing as per Gold/transcript). This misrepresents the timing and nature of denials compared to Gold's precise account. Score: 3",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: four symptoms listed (100% names, but misses details like stuffy nose first/before fever, sore throat persistent/not going away, fever 'terrible' for exactly 3 days, muscle aches 2-3 days coinciding with fever, no joint pain clarification); denials listed (100% of the five specified), but misses all details/quotes/citations (e.g., P-5 nausea/vomiting, P-7 neck stiffness, etc.) and other Gold extras not central. Covers core lists (~60-70% of articulated points). Score: 3",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms fully verifiable with accurate citations (P-1, P-13); denials themselves verifiable in transcript at specific points, but citations wrong ([P-1] lacks denials), and explanation hallucinates that absence in P-1 constitutes 'explicit' or 'effective' denial rather than the direct 'No' responses to doctor's questions later—multiple inaccuracies in sourcing and reasoning. Score: 2",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the exact four reported symptoms and the five specific denied ones with lists and summary, no off-topic content. Score: 5"
