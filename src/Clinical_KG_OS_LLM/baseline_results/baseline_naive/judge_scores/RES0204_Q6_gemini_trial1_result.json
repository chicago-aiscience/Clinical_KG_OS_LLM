  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the two planned diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID-19 swab) and the requirement for consultation with a supervising physician.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a few key elements from the Gold Answer: 1) The physical examination of the lungs and heart mentioned in [D-1], 2) The age-appropriate explanations for the X-ray and COVID swab (e.g., 'picture of your body on the inside'), and 3) The mention of the patient's agreement and the doctor's closing thanks. It covers the primary medical steps but lacks the comprehensive procedural and communication details found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript. It accurately cites the doctor's intent to consult the supervisor [D-1][D-37], the tests proposed [D-37][D-39], and the follow-up intent [D-40].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the question regarding the diagnostic tests, consultation, and follow-up steps."
