  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the three symptom domains mentioned (smell change, taste change, and mild dry cough) and correctly characterizes the cough as mild and dry per [P-1]. However, it inaccurately states the patient “completely lost” taste. The transcript clarifies taste loss was partial: the patient could still taste very salty foods but not normal foods (e.g., banana) [P-4]. It also under-specifies the degree of smell loss, which was explicitly partial (“smell isn’t totally gone” and can smell very bad odors) [P-4].",
    "completeness": "It includes the three main symptoms but misses most key qualifying details required by the question and present in the Gold Answer: partial smell loss with preserved detection of very strong unpleasant odors [P-4]; partial taste loss with preserved detection of very salty foods and inability to taste normal foods like banana [P-4]; symptoms were consistent over two days [P-5]; cough started at same time as sensory symptoms [P-6]; cough non-productive with no sputum/blood [P-7]; no worsening [P-8]; no triggers identified [P-21].",
    "faithfulness": "The statement of reduced smell is consistent with [P-1]. The claim of “completely lost” taste is not supported when considering the full transcript and is contradicted by [P-4], making that portion unfaithful to the source. No other major unsupported claims are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on sensory and respiratory symptoms and attempts to describe degree of symptoms, so it addresses the question. However, it does not provide the requested patient-specific perceptual details (what they could/could not perceive) beyond a generic summary."
