  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all elements of the Gold Answer's description of the management plan from [D-52], including labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs), chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring with supplemental oxygen if needed, continuation of bronchodilators (with accurate reference to Ventolin/Ventilin and Spiriva from transcript), steroids, and antibiotics. No factual errors or contradictions; minor categorization of COVID swab under monitoring instead of labs is not inaccurate, and specific drug names are correctly pulled from transcript without error. The omission of blood pressure monitoring from [D-37] and results timeframe does not introduce errors in stated facts, making it fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: all labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs), COVID swab, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring and supplemental oxygen, continuation of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics. Adds specific bronchodilator names (bonus, accurate). Missed: explicit mention of results in 24-48 hours for tests, and blood pressure monitoring from [D-37] presented as part of comprehensive plan. Covers ~90% of key points (core plan fully, minor details missed), warranting 4.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: labs, CXR, O2 sat/O2, COVID swab, bronchodilators continuation, steroids, antibiotics all from [D-52]; bronchodilator names from [P-11]. Citations accurate ([D-52], [P-11]). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to match question's request for labs, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions (steroids, antibiotics, O2, bronchodilators), with no off-topic content or tangents. Directly addresses the query."
