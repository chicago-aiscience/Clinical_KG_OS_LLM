  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as anxiety, which aligns with the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain'. However, it includes references to a 'Knowledge Graph' and specific RDF-style triples (e.g., [PROCEDURE] studying --[CAUSES]--> [SYMPTOM] chest pain) which are not present in the provided transcript or source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It does not mention the specific clinical observation of the patient breathing faster or having difficulty taking a deep breath due to nervousness [P-19]. 2) It omits the comprehensive list of pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, pain at rest, no palpitations, no asthma) used to rule out other pathologies. It covers the history of anxiety, current stress levels, and the situational nature of the pain.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinations the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source of evidence. While the clinical conclusions are generally supported by the transcript, the attribution to this external data structure is not grounded in the provided text. Other details, such as the use of reading to manage stress, are accurately pulled from the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly answering the question about the diagnosis and the clinical observations supporting it."
