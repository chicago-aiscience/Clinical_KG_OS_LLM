  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, correctly states that a COVID swab was ordered, accurately reports the 48-hour turnaround time, and accurately relays the isolation instruction while awaiting results. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Covers the main elements: (1) COVID-19 rule-out, (2) swab test ordered, (3) 48-hour turnaround, (4) isolate at home/avoid others. It omits the additional instruction from the Gold Answer that the patient would receive further instructions from public health once results return.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (notably [P-1] and [D-39]) and there are no added clinical details beyond what was said. The brief mention of a “knowledge graph” is extraneous framing but does not introduce unsupported medical content.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question (condition, test, turnaround time, and waiting instructions) with no substantive tangents."
