  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain information about medications tried. The patient explicitly mentions 'decongestants' in [P-10]. It also fails to provide the patient's assessment of that specific medication (noting it worked 'a little bit'), instead substituting a general comment about their condition from [P-1].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific mention of 'decongestants', the nuance that they helped 'a little bit', and the doctor's recommendation for hydration.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a 'hallucination of absence' by claiming the transcript lacks information about previous medications when [P-10] clearly provides it. The assessment of effectiveness is also unfaithful to the specific question about the medication's effect.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in terms of structure, as it directly attempts to answer all three parts of the user's question, though its factual accuracy is low."
