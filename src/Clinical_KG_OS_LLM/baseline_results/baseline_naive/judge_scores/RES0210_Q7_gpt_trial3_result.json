  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Raspy cough onset: Correct (Friday) vs Gold.\n- Yellow sputum with red spots: Partially incorrect/incomplete. Generated mentions red spots starting Sunday, but does not clearly state the *yellow sputum* also began Sunday and that both started simultaneously (Gold: both started Sunday at once).\n- Fever onset: Essentially correct (Monday). Generated cites P-5; Gold emphasizes P-8 for Monday onset and persistence to Wednesday.\n- Chills onset: Incorrect. Generated infers “Monday and Tuesday,” but with a Wednesday visit “last two days” corresponds to Tuesday–Wednesday (Gold).\n- Right-sided chest pain onset: Incorrect. Generated places it on Wednesday, but transcript indicates it was “specially notice over the last day,” i.e., starting about Tuesday (Gold).\n- Worsening course: Partly captured (respiratory → systemic → pleuritic pain/dyspnea), but misses the key Gold point that cough became “really bad” on Sunday and that sputum changes were part of that Sunday worsening.\nOverall: some key day assignments are wrong (chills, chest pain) and one symptom (yellow sputum) is not properly dated, though the general sequence is partly correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold elements covered:\n- Friday raspy cough (covered).\n- Sunday blood-tinged sputum/red spots (covered).\n- Monday fever beginning and continuing to Wednesday (partly covered; persistence not clearly stated).\n- Chills occurring near end of course (covered but mis-dated).\n- Right-sided chest pain described and pleuritic worsening with deep breath/cough (covered but mis-dated).\n\nKey Gold elements missed or insufficient:\n- Explicit onset of *yellow* sputum on Sunday and that it started simultaneously with red spots.\n- Explicit statement that cough became “really bad” on Sunday (worsening inflection point).\n- Runny nose about a week prior with resolution.\n- Sore throat from coughing.\n- Chest pain being constant/dull and first noticed “over the last day” (Tuesday onset).\n\nCoverage is moderate but not near-complete.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are tied to transcript quotes.\n- However, the answer introduces “knowledge graph indicators” and relationship arrows not present in the transcript (unverifiable embellishment).\n- Day inferences for chills (Monday/Tuesday) and chest pain (Wednesday) are not supported by the transcript phrasing when anchored to Wednesday as ‘today’.\nThus, there are several claims not well-grounded and at least one clearly extraneous (knowledge graph) addition.",
    "relevance": "- The response stays focused on the requested timeline and symptom onset/progression.\n- Minor irrelevant content: the ‘knowledge graph’ discussion is not asked for and adds distraction.\n- Otherwise, it directly attempts to address each symptom’s onset and overall worsening."
