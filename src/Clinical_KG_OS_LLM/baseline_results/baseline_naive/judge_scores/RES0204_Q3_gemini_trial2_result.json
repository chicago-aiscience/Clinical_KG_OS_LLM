  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the present symptoms (dry cough, runny nose) and the specific reasons given by the doctor for the X-ray ('get a better look') and the COVID swab (standard protocol). However, it completely ignores the 'absent findings' (pertinent negatives) part of the prompt, which were essential to the Gold Answer's explanation of the diagnostic logic.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a significant portion of the Gold Answer's content. It fails to mention any of the 'absent findings' listed in the prompt and Gold Answer (no fever, no sore throat, no loss of taste/smell, etc.). It also misses the context that the cough was novel for the patient and that the persistent nature of the cough despite the lack of high-acuity markers was what prompted the X-ray.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer describes the patient's condition as 'Symptoms of Respiratory Distress.' This is a hallucination/clinical inaccuracy, as the transcript explicitly states the patient did not have shortness of breath or wheezing [P-28]. It also attributes the need for an exam in [D-1] to the identification of symptoms, but in the transcript, [D-1] occurs before the patient has even shared their symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer only partially addresses the prompt. The prompt specifically asks how the 'combination of these present and absent findings' led to the workup. The Generated Answer ignores the absent findings entirely, focusing only on the present symptoms."
