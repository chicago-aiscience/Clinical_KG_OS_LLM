  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: patient takes Lipitor for high cholesterol and also took OTC Tylenol for febrile/unwell symptoms, which “helps a little bit.” Generated answer correctly identifies Lipitor for high cholesterol, but incorrectly states the transcript does not indicate any OTC medication use. This directly contradicts [P-14] where the patient reports taking Tylenol and that it helped a little. Therefore, the generated answer contains a significant factual error/omission about OTC medication use and effectiveness.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer: (1) Lipitor/atorvastatin prescribed for high cholesterol; (2) Lipitor is the only prescription med; (3) OTC Tylenol/acetaminophen used for symptom relief (feverish/unwell) and reported as helping “a little bit” (partial relief); (4) no other meds mentioned. Generated answer includes only (1). It misses (2), (3), and (4) (and incorrectly denies OTC use), so coverage is well under half of required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that “the transcript does not indicate that the patient is currently taking any over-the-counter medications” is not grounded and is contradicted by the transcript (Tylenol at home, [P-14]). References to a “knowledge graph” are not part of the provided transcript and are therefore not verifiable. While the Lipitor portion is grounded, there are multiple unfaithful elements.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address medications and indications, which is on-topic. However, it fails to answer a central part of the question (OTC meds and their effectiveness) and provides an incorrect denial of OTC use. Overall it is only partially responsive."
