  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies the overall diagnosis as anxiety (i.e., anxiety-/stress-related chest pain), which is consistent with the Gold Answer’s conclusion of anxiety-related/stress-induced chest pain. It correctly cites key supporting elements from the transcript: symptoms occurring during studying/walking [P-4], prior anxiety attacks [P-21], and the patient considering stress as a cause [P-8]. However, it adds questionable/unsupported clinical reasoning (e.g., lack of response to OTC analgesics implying psychosomatic pain) and overstates that “distraction” via reading books mitigates chest pain (the transcript describes this as a stress-management strategy, not symptom resolution).",
    "completeness": "It captures some major supports (symptoms during studying/walking, anxiety history, stress) but misses multiple important Gold Answer supports: (1) the central pattern of improvement/resolution with distraction and social interaction [P-9, P-29]; (2) the physiologic anxiety features during episodes (making herself nervous, breathing faster, difficulty taking deep breath due to nervousness) [P-19]; and (3) pertinent negatives supporting anxiety over cardiopulmonary causes (no fevers [P-12], no exertional worsening [P-10], occurs at rest [D-11, P-11], no palpitations outside anxiety [P-20], no asthma [P-23-24]).",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not grounded in the provided transcript: references to a “Knowledge Graph” and causal relations (e.g., studying/walking ‘CAUSES’ chest pain; smoking ‘CAUSES’ heart attack) are not present in the source. Also, the claim that engaging in non-academic activities (reading) ‘helps mitigate the symptoms’ is not stated. These reduce faithfulness despite some correctly cited transcript quotes.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely focused on the question: it gives a diagnosis and attempts to justify it with consultation observations. Minor tangents (Knowledge Graph references and OTC analgesic response) dilute the focus but it remains generally on-topic."
