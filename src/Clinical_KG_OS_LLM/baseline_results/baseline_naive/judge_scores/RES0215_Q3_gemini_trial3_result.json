  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma, which is consistent with the Gold Answer. However, it fails to specify 'exercise-induced bronchoconstriction' or the 'atopic predisposition' mentioned in the Gold Answer. It also adds an 'acute exacerbation' qualifier that isn't explicitly the focus of the Gold Answer's diagnostic summary.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the spontaneous resolution with rest (which was explicitly mentioned in the prompt's premise), the nocturnal symptoms (P-43, P-44), and the pertinent negatives (lack of fever, phlegm, etc.) that rule out infection. It covers about 50-60% of the key supporting findings.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' and uses metadata tags (e.g., [SYMPTOM], [KG], [TREATMENT]) that are not found in the source transcript. The prompt specifically asked for findings 'from the transcript,' making the inclusion of an external knowledge source unfaithful to the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally relevant and addresses the prompt's question about diagnosis and supporting findings. However, the inclusion of 'Knowledge Graph' references is a tangent that does not strictly follow the instruction to use the transcript as the source of support."
