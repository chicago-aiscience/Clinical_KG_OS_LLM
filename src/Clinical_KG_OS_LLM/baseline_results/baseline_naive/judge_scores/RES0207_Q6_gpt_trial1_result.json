  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incorrect relative to the Gold Answer. The transcript clearly contains the end-of-consultation plan in D-37 and the closing in D-38. The Generated Answer wrongly states that next steps “cannot be determined” and incorrectly claims the transcript “ends abruptly” at [P-23]. This directly contradicts the source transcript and misses the documented plan: the clinician will review the case with the doctor working that day, then return shortly to discuss next steps, including possible tests and how to proceed.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are missed:\n- Review information with “the doctor who’s working today” (shared decision-making / another physician involved) [D-37].\n- Clinician will “come back shortly” to discuss next steps [D-37, D-38].\n- Possible ordering of tests (“if there’s any tests we want to do”) [D-37].\n- Plan to decide how to “move forward with this” [D-37].\n- Patient agreement/acknowledgment [P-37].\n- No specific tests/treatments named in the encounter.\nThe Generated Answer provides none of these and instead summarizes earlier history, so coverage is <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple claims not supported by the transcript and is internally inconsistent with the provided text:\n- It asserts the transcript ends at [P-23]; however, the provided transcript continues through [D-38].\n- It claims there are “no subsequent turns attributed to the doctor,” which is false given D-24 through D-38.\nThese are major ungrounded statements, indicating low faithfulness to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is framed as answering the question about next steps, decision-makers, and follow-up actions, but it ultimately does not provide the requested information and incorrectly dismisses the availability of those details. It is topically aligned but functionally fails to answer the question."
