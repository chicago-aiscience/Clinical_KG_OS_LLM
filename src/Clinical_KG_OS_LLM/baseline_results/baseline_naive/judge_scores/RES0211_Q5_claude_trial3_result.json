  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that information about Jessica's family history, brother's cold, and living situation is not available in the transcript. The transcript clearly contains P-30 (cousin with asthma), P-33 (father with allergies), P-39 (brother's cold a few weeks ago), P-41 (homeschooling during COVID), P-42 (family working from home/on farm), and P-43-P-44 (living on a farm). This represents a fundamental factual error that contradicts the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the core question about how these contextual factors relate to Jessica's symptoms. While it does describe Jessica's current symptoms and mentions her allergy history, it completely omits discussion of the family history, brother's cold, and household situation that the question specifically asks about. This represents coverage of <20% of the key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is faithful in describing Jessica's current symptoms based on the transcript. However, the claim that information about family history, brother's cold, and living situation is 'not available' is a significant error - this information IS present in the transcript. This constitutes a major factual misrepresentation of what the source material contains.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the specific question asked. The question requires relating family history, brother's cold, and household situation to current symptoms, but the answer instead claims this information is unavailable and focuses only on current symptom description. This makes it largely off-topic from what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fails to adequately respond to the clinical question, incorrectly claiming that key contextual information about family history, brother's illness, and living situation is unavailable when it is clearly present in the transcript (P-30, P-33, P-39, P-41-44). It does not discuss how these factors relate to Jessica's symptoms, instead only describing her current presentation. This represents major deficiencies in correctness, completeness, and relevance."
