  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three-day timeframe and that the symptoms began while walking the dog. However, it contains a significant factual error by claiming the transcript does not state if symptoms are getting better, worse, or staying the same; the patient explicitly states they are 'staying the same' and 'pretty steady' in [P-2] and [P-3].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer, including: the specific exacerbating factor of getting up from a chair [P-9], the specific detail of taking a 'big breath' [P-9], and the quantification of the impact on walking (reducing from twice a day to once a day [P-22]). It also fails to mention the lack of impact on work attendance.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer's claim that the transcript does not provide information on symptom progression is unfaithful to the source text, as this information is clearly provided in the dialogue. Other details provided are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each component of the multi-part question, even though some of the information provided is incorrect or incomplete."
