  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly states the patient is on an unnamed statin for cholesterol (matches [P-15]) and that the clinician proposed prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72 hours attachment (matches [D-6], reiterated in [D-13]). It also correctly notes the patient previously took antibiotics for a prior tick bite with a bullseye/target rash (matches [P-3]). No incorrect drug names, doses, or durations are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key items: (1) current statin unnamed ✅; (2) no allergies/no drug allergies ❌; (3) prior tick bite treated with antibiotics ✅; (4) new prophylactic antibiotics proposed, no specific antibiotic/dose stated ✅ (but the “no specifics stated” nuance is omitted); (5) plan to consult supervising physician before finalizing ❌; (6) send tick to lab for species ID ❌; (7) possible bloodwork/serology ❌; (8) environmental prevention suggestion (insecticide/yard measures) ❌. Overall, it captures the main medication/prophylaxis points but misses several additional treatments/plans discussed.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (statin use, prophylactic antibiotics rationale, prior antibiotics for bullseye rash). No clear hallucinations or unsupported specifics are added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments discussed (current statin and proposed prophylaxis) and does not add unrelated content."
