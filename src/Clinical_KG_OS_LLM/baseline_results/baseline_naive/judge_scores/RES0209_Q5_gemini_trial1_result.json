  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that information regarding environmental triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) is absent from the transcript, whereas these are explicitly discussed in P-9 and P-11. It also falsely states there is no evidence of the doctor's suspicion of 'undiagnosed allergies', which is directly contradicted by D-12 and D-13. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these links.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover the relationship between the three triggers and the exacerbation. It misses the clinician's suspicion of allergies entirely. While it mentions the family history and general symptoms, it ignores the primary components of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a significant failure in faithfulness by claiming that content present in the transcript (triggers and allergy discussion) is missing. It also references an external 'knowledge graph' not provided in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The response is only partially relevant; it discusses general symptoms and family history but explicitly refuses to answer the core components of the question (triggers and allergy suspicion) based on a false premise of missing information."
