  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the dry cough (onset Wednesday, worsening by Friday), fever (over 100°F/101°F on Friday), fatigue, decreased appetite/loss of taste (from P-17). However, it misses the mild runny nose [P-16] and uncertainty around shortness of breath [P-8]. Critically, it incorrectly states that none of the specific symptoms (wheezing [D-7/P-7], sore throat [D-14/P-14], chest pain [D-13/P-13], chills [D-19/P-19], GI complaints [D-22/P-22, D-23/P-23]) were explicitly asked about and denied, which directly contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer. It also misattributes inquiries to [D-44] (doctor's summary/advice) instead of earlier targeted questions. Significant factual errors on the denied symptoms section.",
    "completeness": "Key reported symptoms from Gold: dry cough (progressive), fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, possible loss of taste, mild runny nose, SOB uncertain (covers cough, fever, fatigue, appetite/taste; misses runny nose, SOB ~70%). Key denied from Gold: sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, skin changes, GI (diarrhea/constipation/blood/nausea/vomiting), urine changes, dizziness/fainting, confusion/memory loss, vision/hearing fine, swallowing uncertain (covers 0%; claims none asked/denied). Overall covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms mostly verifiable with accurate citations (P-1, P-2, P-17). However, major issues: falsely claims wheezing/sore throat/chest pain/chills/GI not asked/denied (directly in P-7,13,14,19,22-23). Misinterprets inquiries as from [D-44] (not true; asks are D-6-D-26). Adds unverifiable 'patient did not eat breakfast' (P-17 is 'not into breakfast'). Lists later advice symptoms (seizures etc from D-44) as inquired but not denied, which is off-ground and confuses history-taking. Multiple inaccuracies/misreads equivalent to hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around 'Reported Respiratory and Systemic Symptoms' and 'Symptoms Explicitly Asked About and Denied', addressing both parts of the question. Minor tangents in listing non-example symptoms from D-44 advice, but focused on question's elements (e.g., specifies the examples)."
