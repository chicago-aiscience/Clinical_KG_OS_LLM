  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies several symptoms (dry cough, described as almost nonstop during the day; shortness of breath; wheezing). However, it contains major factual errors/contradictions versus the transcript and Gold Answer: (1) it claims the patient did not explicitly report chest tightness, but the patient clearly answered “Yes” to chest tightness (D-20/P-20); (2) it claims there was no nighttime symptom information, but the patient reported nighttime symptoms occurring “every other day”/“every two days” and less often than daytime (P-18); (3) it misstates the cough duration as “over the past week,” whereas the history clarifies “last two weeks” (P-13). These errors significantly undermine accuracy on the core question (day vs night frequency and chest sensations).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: dry cough; near-nonstop daytime cough; shortness of breath; wheezing. Key elements missed or incorrectly negated: explicit chest tightness; explicit nighttime symptom frequency and comparison to daytime; duration of ~2 weeks; nonproductive nature as confirmed by clinician questioning; statement that wheezing occurred more frequently than bronchodilator use and that inhaler was used when breathing difficulty was severe. Overall, substantially less than full coverage of required details.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims are not grounded or directly contradicted by the transcript: denying chest sensations/tightness despite D-20/P-20, and denying nighttime symptom data despite P-18. It also introduces “knowledge graph” assertions (e.g., standard treatment/chest tightness as established in KG) that are not part of the provided transcript, which counts as hallucinated/unverifiable material in this context.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked symptom domains (cough character, breathing difficulty, wheeze, chest sensations, and day vs night frequency). The “knowledge graph” references are a minor tangent but still within asthma context."
