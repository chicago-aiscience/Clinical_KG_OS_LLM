  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains two major factual errors. First, it claims the patient did not explicitly report chest sensations, whereas the patient confirmed chest tightness in P-20. Second, it states no information was provided regarding nighttime symptoms or frequency comparison, whereas the patient explicitly described nighttime symptoms occurring every other day or every two days in P-18, specifically stating they happen less than daytime symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The response fails to cover key points from the Gold Answer regarding chest tightness and the specific frequency of nighttime symptoms (every other day). It misses approximately 50% of the required symptom detail and frequency analysis requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a hallucinated absence of information. It claims that certain data (chest tightness and nighttime symptoms) is not in the transcript when it is clearly present in segments P-18 and P-20.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address the question's categories but fails to provide the actual information requested for half of the prompts, incorrectly concluding that the information was missing from the consultation."
