  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error. It explicitly states that the doctor did not ask about wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, or GI complaints, whereas the transcript shows the doctor asking about wheezing (D-7), chest pain (D-13), sore throat (D-14), chills (D-19), and GI issues (D-22, D-23). The patient denied all of these. The generated answer also missed 'runny nose' in the reported symptoms section.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most reported symptoms (cough, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of taste) but misses the runny nose mentioned in P-16. More significantly, it fails to provide the list of denied symptoms requested by the prompt, falsely claiming they were not asked about.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the symptoms listed in the prompt were not mentioned in the transcript. It incorrectly cites D-44 (the doctor's concluding advice) as the primary source of inquiries while ignoring the actual history-taking section of the dialogue (D-5 through D-26).",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address both parts of the question, but because it incorrectly concludes that the second part cannot be answered from the text, it fails to provide a relevant or helpful response to that portion of the query."
