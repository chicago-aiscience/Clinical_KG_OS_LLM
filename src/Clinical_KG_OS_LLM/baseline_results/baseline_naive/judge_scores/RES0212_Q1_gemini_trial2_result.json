  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding chest pain. It states the patient denied pain associated with the cough, whereas the transcript (P-3) explicitly states it 'kinda hurts when I cough'. It also misses the distinction that the cough has lasted three months and only recently became productive.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the 3-month duration, the intermittent/dry history, the subjective fevers ('hot at night'), the impact on exercise, and the lack of blood or smell in the sputum. Furthermore, it omits the majority of symptoms denied by the patient (night sweats, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript using direct quotes, but it misinterprets the patient's statement about pain. While she denied general body pain, she confirmed chest pain specifically associated with coughing, which the Generated Answer incorrectly categorizes as a denial.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the categories requested in the prompt (respiratory symptoms, associated symptoms, and denials), although the content within those categories is sparse."
