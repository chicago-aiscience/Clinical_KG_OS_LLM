  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer explicitly links acid reflux to potential contribution to persistent cough due to incomplete control (diet only, no meds), notes hay fever as history of airway sensitivity without current symptoms, and occupational exposure as infection risk despite PPE. Generated Answer accurately reports facts (history of reflux managed by diet, hay fever, hospital clerk with COVID negative) but does not affirm reflux as a recognized contributor, downplays occupational infection risk in favor of social/COVID context, and provides minimal linkage for hay fever; minor discrepancies in emphasis and interpretation of control, but core transcript facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Acid reflux - diet-only management [P-25], no meds [P-23], helped but possibly uncontrolled, known cough contributor; (2) Hay fever - airway sensitivity history, no active role; (3) Occupational - infection risk, PPE [P-17]; plus post-viral context, anxiety. Generated covers: reflux history/diet [P-22,P-25], hay fever [P-27], occupational with work concern/COVID [P-35]; misses no-medication detail, incomplete control, reflux causation link, hay fever nuance, infection risk, anxiety; covers ~60% (presentation + listings but shallow contributions).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., cough details [P-2,5,13,14,15], occupational [P-34,35], reflux [P-22,25], hay fever [P-27], COVID [P-35]); no fabricated facts, minor ambiguity in 'latter' reference but grounded overall.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around presentation, occupational exposure, and medical history (reflux, hay fever) per question; addresses persistence outlasting symptoms; however, focuses more on descriptive context (COVID rule-out, work concern) than explanatory 'how might contribute' for each factor, with some tangent on presentation details."
