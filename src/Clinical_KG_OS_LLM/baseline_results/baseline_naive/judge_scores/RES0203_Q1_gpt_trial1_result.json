  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the three symptom categories reported: decreased smell, altered taste, and a mild dry cough. However, it contains a major factual error about the *degree* of taste loss: it states the patient \"completely lost\" taste, whereas the transcript clarifies taste loss was partial (can still taste very salty foods but not normal flavors like banana) [P-4]. It also omits transcript-confirmed aspects of the cough (non-productive, no blood; consistent; same onset as sensory symptoms) and omits that smell loss was explicitly not total (still smells very bad odors) [P-4]. Given the incorrect characterization of taste loss degree, correctness is significantly reduced.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer: (1) partial smell loss with specific residual perception (very bad/strong odors), (2) partial taste loss with residual perception (very salty) and inability to taste normal foods (banana example), (3) mild dry cough that is non-productive/no blood, (4) symptoms present for two days, (5) symptoms consistent over time (not worsening/fluctuating), (6) cough began same time as sensory symptoms, (7) no cough triggers identified. \nGenerated Answer covers: (a) reduced smell (without degree/details), (b) taste change but incorrectly as complete loss, (c) mild dry cough. It misses duration, residual perception details, consistency/trajectory, onset timing, sputum/blood, and trigger info. This is well under full coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is grounded in [P-1] (reduced smell, taste loss mentioned, mild dry cough). However, the statement that taste was \"completely lost\" is not supported and is contradicted by the patient’s later clarification that taste was partial [P-4]. The answer also implies severity assessment without incorporating the transcript’s explicit partial-loss details. This constitutes a notable ungrounded/incorrect claim.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked domains (sensory and respiratory symptoms and degree). However, it does not actually provide the requested detail about what the patient could/could not perceive (especially smell/taste specifics), so it only partially addresses the question."
