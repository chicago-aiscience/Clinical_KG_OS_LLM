  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the dry cough (P-1, P-14), shortness of breath (P-1), and wheezing (P-15) as consistent with asthma, the patient's diagnosis since age 8 (P-2), and increased bronchodilator use (P-1, P-8 indirectly). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer, but minor discrepancies include omission of chest tightness (P-20, key in Gold and question), inexact bronchodilator frequency escalation, lack of triggers and infection screening details emphasized in Gold. Core facts on symptoms and worsening asthma match.",
    "completeness": "Covered: dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing (3/4 symptoms), asthma diagnosis, bronchodilator relief and general increase in use. Missed: chest tightness (P-20), precise bronchodilator escalation from once every two weeks to 5-6 times/week (P-8), wheezing more frequent than use (P-17), triggers like exercise/cold air (P-9, P-11), comprehensive negative infection screening (P-21-P-28), reversible obstruction, need for med adjustment (D-43). Covers approximately 30-40% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom claims verifiable with accurate citations (P-1, P-14, P-15). Asthma history (P-2) and family history (P-32) grounded. Bronchodilator increase referenced via P-1 (verifiable, though exact details in P-8). 'Knowledge graph supports' is not in transcript: hallucinated claim. Vague baseline frequency is derivable but not directly cited. Mostly grounded with one notable unverifiable addition.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by linking specified symptoms (3/4 listed) and bronchodilator increase to worsening asthma vs. new condition. Minor omission of chest tightness and exact frequency details; includes relevant history but extraneous 'knowledge graph'. No off-topic content."
