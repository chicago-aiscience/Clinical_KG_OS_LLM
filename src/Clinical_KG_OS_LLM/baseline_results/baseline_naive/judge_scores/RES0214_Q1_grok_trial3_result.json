  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer precisely identifies four symptoms (stuffy nose with timing, sore throat persistent, fever 3 days, muscle aches 2-3 days coinciding, not joints) with accurate citations. Generated correctly lists the same four symptoms with basic citations (P-1, P-13). For denials, Gold specifies explicit denials when asked with exact citations (P-5 nausea/vomiting, P-7 neck stiffness, P-8 headaches, P-10 cough, P-24-26 difficulty swallowing with details). Generated lists the correct five denied symptoms but incorrectly claims they were 'effectively denied' by omission in P-1 and cites P-1 wrongly, contradicting Gold's emphasis on explicit denials when asked. This introduces significant factual errors in explanation, basis, and citations for denials despite correct list.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: Detailed four symptoms including timings/clarifications (stuffy nose first, fever 3d, sore throat ongoing, muscle ache 2-3d w/fever, no joints) and citations; explicit denials of five symptoms with specific quotes/citations/details (esp. swallowing). Generated covers the identities of all four symptoms (80% core) and all five denials but misses all timings, clarifications (e.g., no joints), and specific denial citations/quotes/details. Covers ~60-70% of key points (lists correct but lacks depth/details).",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms claims fully verifiable (P-1 for three, P-13 for muscle ache). Denial claims verifiable in transcript (she did explicitly deny each when asked at P-5,7,8,10,24-26) but reasoning 'not reported in P-1 = effectively denied' is ungrounded hallucination/misinterpretation (P-1 only reports positives, not denials); explicit citations P-1 for denials inaccurate/not verifiable; summary cites P-1 wrongly for denials. Multiple inaccuracies in grounding for denial section.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for four reported symptoms and which of five specific symptoms explicitly denied when asked. Generated structures response directly addressing this: sections for reported (lists four) and denied (lists all five), summary reiterates. No off-topic content despite errors in justification; perfectly focused on question."
