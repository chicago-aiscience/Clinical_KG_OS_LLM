  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect. It claims the transcript ends at [P-23] and that next steps cannot be determined. In reality, the transcript provided continues to [D-38], where the doctor explicitly outlines next steps, including consulting with another doctor and potentially ordering tests.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses all key points from the Gold Answer because it incorrectly asserts the information is missing. It fails to mention the consultation with the other doctor, the potential for tests, or the plan to return shortly.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the provided source. It makes a false claim about the length of the transcript (stating it ends at [P-23] when it ends at [D-38]) and therefore hallucinates the absence of information that is clearly present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question. Instead of answering what the next steps were, it provides an incorrect explanation of why it cannot answer the question."
