  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it claims 'smell [was] lost', whereas the transcript [P-19] explicitly states 'maybe taste a little bit but not smell'. It also overlooks 'difficulty breathing' and 'muscle aches' as part of the symptom combination identified by the doctor and the Gold Answer. Furthermore, it attributes the doctor's suspicion primarily to 'difficulty swallowing food', which is not emphasized as a core COVID symptom in the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, including new-onset difficulty breathing and generalized muscle aches. It focuses heavily on 'difficulty swallowing', which is a secondary detail. It fails to address the specific part of the question regarding how 'reduced taste without loss of smell' supports the reasoning, instead providing a contradictory account of those symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' and specific RDF-style links (e.g., SYMPTOM --[INDICATES]--> DIAGNOSIS) that are not present in the source transcript. It also directly contradicts the transcript regarding the loss of smell, stating it was lost when the patient said it was not.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the question, it includes significant irrelevant content regarding a 'Knowledge Graph' and provides incorrect information about the specific symptoms (smell/taste) asked about in the prompt."
