{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with both the transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the diagnosis (viral infection/common cold) and accurately cites the symptoms (stuffy/runny nose), discharge quality (clear), and duration (one week).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several significant points from the Gold Answer and the prompt's specific requirements. It completely omits the 'exposure history' component (the nephew in daycare). It also fails to detail the specific evidence used to rule out allergic causes (lack of exposure to fumes, dust, animals; no history of allergies) and bacterial causes (specifically mentioning the absence of fever or headache). It lists 'absence of severe symptoms' generally but lacks the specific negative features mentioned in the Gold Answer (cough, sore throat, chills, etc.).",
    "faithfulness": "The response is grounded in the transcript, but it hallucinates a source by referencing a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context. All other clinical claims are supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but only partially addresses the prompt because it ignores the 'exposure history' aspect of the question."
