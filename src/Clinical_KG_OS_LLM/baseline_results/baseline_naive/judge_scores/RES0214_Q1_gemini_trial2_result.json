  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four symptoms reported (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) and the five specific symptoms denied (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding 'explicit denial'. It claims the patient denied them 'effectively' by not reporting them in P-1, whereas the Gold Answer correctly notes that she denied them explicitly when the doctor asked later in the transcript (P-5, P-7, P-8, P-10, P-24).",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies all the specific symptoms requested in both categories (reported and denied), covering 100% of the key clinical points requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails to ground the 'denied' symptoms in the correct part of the transcript. It attributes the denial to the patient not mentioning them in her opening statement [P-1], ignoring the actual dialogue where the doctor asks about each one and the patient says 'No'. This is a hallucination of reasoning/process that contradicts the clear evidence in turns [P-5] through [P-26].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant as it directly addresses both parts of the question (reported vs. denied symptoms) without including unnecessary information about the patient's history or social situation."
