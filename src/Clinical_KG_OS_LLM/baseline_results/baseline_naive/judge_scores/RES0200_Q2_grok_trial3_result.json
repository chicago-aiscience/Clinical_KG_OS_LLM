  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Ventolin (Ventilin) and Spiriva as the respiratory inhalers the patient was taking prior to the visit, matching [P-11] and the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states there are no non-respiratory medications mentioned, missing atorvastatin ('Torva Staten') explicitly stated in [P-38] and confirmed in [D-39]. It wrongly claims no specific quantitative frequency for Ventolin use in the past week, despite [P-12] where the patient says 'almost like 10 times this past week.' It also erroneously states no information on self-discontinued medications, contradicting [P-35] and [P-36] about stopping a diuretic without doctor approval. These are significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Ventolin and Spiriva as respiratory inhalers; (2) Ventolin used ~10 times past week; (3) atorvastatin for cholesterol; (4) previously prescribed diuretic discontinued without approval. Generated covers only (1) partially (names inhalers but misses 'as needed for relief' detail). Misses (2), (3), and (4) entirely. Covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Ventolin and Spiriva are verifiable in [P-11]. However, claim of 'no non-respiratory drugs' is unverifiable and contradicted by [P-38]. Claim of no specific Ventolin frequency ignores [P-12] directly. Claim of no self-discontinued medication ignores [P-35,P-36]. No hallucinations of new facts, but multiple denials of transcript evidence make it ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to directly address the question's components (medications taken, Ventolin frequency, discontinued meds) with headings, staying focused without irrelevant tangents or off-topic content."
