  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor *did* systematically explore potential exposure sources:\n- Living situation: asked “where do you currently live?” [P-45].\n- Home/environmental exposures: asked about “old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets” [D-46] with patient denial [P-46].\n- Sick contacts: asked about contact with anyone sick [D-47], patient notes possible incidental work lunchroom contact [P-47].\n- Workplace: asked where patient works [P-48] and whether anyone at work has been sick [D-50/P-50].\n- Travel: asked about travel [D-49/P-49].\nThus the claim that these were “not asked or discussed” directly contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include essentially all key exposure-source elements present in the Gold Answer (living situation, environmental triggers, sick contacts, workplace and whether coworkers were sick, travel history, and the note that no clear source was identified). It instead incorrectly asserts none were explored. Completeness is therefore extremely low.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is not grounded in the transcript because it denies the presence of multiple explicit questions that are actually in the transcript (D-45 to D-50). This is a major contradiction rather than a minor omission, so faithfulness is very poor.",
    "relevance": "It addresses the general question about whether exposure sources were explored, but provides an incorrect conclusion and does not list the explored sources. So it is only minimally responsive to the prompt."
