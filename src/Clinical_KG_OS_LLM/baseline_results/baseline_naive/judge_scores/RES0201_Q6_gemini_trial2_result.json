  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the assessment (COVID-19 symptoms), the specific tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), and the isolation instructions (both pre-result and post-result if symptomatic).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key components requested in the prompt: the doctor's assessment, management plan, specific tests, isolation instructions, and the condition for continued isolation after a negative result. It only omits the minor detail regarding the doctor consulting with a supervisor, which was included in the gold answer but is secondary to the management plan itself.",

    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant and directly addresses each part of the user's multi-part question without unnecessary tangents."
