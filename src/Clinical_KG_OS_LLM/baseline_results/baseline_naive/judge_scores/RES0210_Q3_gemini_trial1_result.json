{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (productive cough, hemoptysis, fever, chills, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain). However, it defines the chest pain as 'sharp' in the reasoning section, whereas the patient specifically describes it as 'dull' [P-21]. It also labels the fever as an 'objective systemic sign', while the transcript clarifies the patient 'never took [their] temperature' [P-8], making it a subjective fever.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses the patient's smoking history, which the Gold Answer includes as a significant predisposing factor for LRTI. It also omits the specific 'yellow custard' description of the sputum [P-6] and the detail that the pain is constant even at rest [P-20].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript. However, it characterizes the fever as 'objective' despite the patient explicitly stating they didn't use a thermometer. The interpretation of the pain as 'sharp' is a medical inference that contradicts the patient's own description of 'dull' pain.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and effectively addresses all parts of the prompt, linking specific transcript findings to the diagnostic reasoning for pneumonia."
