  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s main diagnostic conclusion (anxiety/stress-related chest pain) aligns with the Gold Answer’s conclusion. However, it introduces several inaccurate or weakly supported elements: (1) it asserts “distraction…helps mitigate the symptoms” by citing the patient reading at night, but the transcript does not link reading to symptom resolution—only to general stress management [P-28]; (2) it relies on a “Knowledge Graph” and causal statements (e.g., studying/walking ‘CAUSES’ chest pain; smoking ‘CAUSES’ heart attack) that are not part of the transcript or Gold Answer; (3) it omits key Gold-supported physiologic anxiety features (nervousness/hyperventilation) and key negatives, which doesn’t make it wrong but makes the reasoning less accurate/clinically tight compared with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: \n- Anxiety-related diagnosis stated.\n- Chest pain occurs when studying/walking to school (part of situational pattern) [P-4].\n- Past anxiety attacks as a teen [P-21] and patient considering stress as cause [P-8].\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed or inadequately captured:\n- Central pattern of resolution with distraction/social interaction/hands-on tasks [P-9, P-29].\n- Current heightened thesis/time-crunch stress explicitly described [P-13, P-15, P-16].\n- Episode features: “makes herself nervous” and breathes faster / difficulty taking deep breath due to nervousness [P-19].\n- Pertinent negatives supporting non-cardiac/non-pulmonary etiology: no fever [P-12], not worse with exercise [P-10], occurs at rest [D-11, P-11], no palpitations outside anxiety episodes [P-20], no asthma [P-23, P-24].\nOverall, it captures some but not most of the supporting observations from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the provided transcript: repeated references to a “Knowledge Graph” and its asserted causal links are fabricated relative to the transcript. The claim that non-academic reading (distraction) mitigates chest pain is not directly supported (the patient mentions reading as a stress strategy, not as a chest-pain reliever) [P-28]. While some points are transcript-based (studying/walking association, anxiety history), the answer contains multiple unverified additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on identifying an anxiety-related diagnosis and provides supporting observations. However, it includes tangential/irrelevant content about a “Knowledge Graph” and medication response (analgesics) that is not part of the Gold’s core reasoning, which slightly dilutes relevance but does not derail the answer."
