  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as a “cardiac ischemic picture/cardiac ischemia,” matching the Gold Answer. It also correctly reports the clinician’s rationale that the complaint was chest tightness rather than pain and that the clinician noted the patient “didn’t really get out of breath with exercise.” However, it inaccurately cites [P-1] as evidence of “no pain” (the explicit denial is at [P-5]), and it omits other pertinent negatives (anxiety, sweating, impending doom) that the Gold Answer includes as part of the clinician’s reasoning.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold: (1) condition lowered = cardiac ischemic picture; (2) chest symptoms = tightness not pain; (3) clinician noted not really out of breath with exercise; (4) absence of associated red-flag symptoms (anxiety/sweating/impending doom) and denial of pain. Generated covers (1), (2), (3), and denial of pain, but misses the explicit absence of anxiety/sweating/impending doom. Overall this is substantial but not complete coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript, especially the clinician quote from [D-36] and the description of tightness from [P-1]. The main faithfulness issue is using [P-1] to support “no pain,” which is not explicitly stated there (it is explicit at [P-5]). No clear hallucinated conditions or symptoms beyond that miscitation/overreach.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what condition was lowered and what symptom findings (nature of chest complaint and absent symptoms) were cited. It stays on-topic with minimal extraneous content."
