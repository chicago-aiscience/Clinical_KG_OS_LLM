  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core timeline: onset symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue), recent symptoms (fever, loss of taste), and emerging symptoms (cough, sore throat). However, it misclassifies 'headaches' as an emerging symptom, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer clarify that these are likely baseline stress headaches. It also omits the patient's specific description of breathing as 'laborious'.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key clinical details present in the Gold Answer, including: generalized body aches, weakness, reduced appetite, and the diminished sense of smell (which is mentioned in the summary but not placed in the timeline). It covers approximately 60% of the specific symptomatic points detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-4, P-7, P-9, P-11]. It does not hallucinate symptoms not present in the text, although the categorization of headaches as 'emerging' is a slight misinterpretation of the patient's statement about his chronic headaches.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, specifically structured to answer the prompt's request for a reconstructed timeline across three distinct phases."
