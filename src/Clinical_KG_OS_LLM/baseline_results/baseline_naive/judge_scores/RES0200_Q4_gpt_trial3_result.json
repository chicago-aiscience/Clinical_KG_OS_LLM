  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all required elements: (1) the alternative diagnosis to exclude is COVID-19, (2) the ordered test is a COVID swab, and (3) the expected turnaround time is 24–48 hours. No contradictions or factual errors relative to the Gold Answer were identified.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points from the Gold Answer: identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, specifies a COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and provides the expected result timeframe of 24–48 hours. No key elements are missing.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are supported by the transcript: the doctor explicitly mentions symptom overlap with COVID and ordering a COVID swab with results in 24–48 hours (D-52). The answer’s mention that cough and shortness of breath overlapped is consistent with the patient’s reported symptoms and the doctor’s general statement about overlap; it does not introduce new unsupported clinical facts. Minor extraneous phrasing (“knowledge graph information”) is not substantiated but does not add clinical claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by naming the alternative diagnosis, the specific test ordered, and the turnaround time, with no meaningful tangents."
