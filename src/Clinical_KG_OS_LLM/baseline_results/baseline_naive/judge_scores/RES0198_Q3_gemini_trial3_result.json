  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer regarding the patient's symptoms (stuffy/runny nose), the discharge quality (clear), the duration (one week), and the doctor's diagnosis (common cold). It correctly identifies the supportive care recommendation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points provided in the gold answer and requested in the prompt. Specifically, it fails to mention 'absent features' (denial of cough, fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, and headache) which are crucial for ruling out bacterial causes or severe viral infections. It also omits the 'exposure history' (the nephew in daycare) and the specific evidence against an allergic cause (no history of allergies, no exposure to dust/fumes/animals).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but does not fully satisfy the specific constraints of the prompt, which explicitly asked for 'absent features' and 'exposure history' as part of the evidence."
