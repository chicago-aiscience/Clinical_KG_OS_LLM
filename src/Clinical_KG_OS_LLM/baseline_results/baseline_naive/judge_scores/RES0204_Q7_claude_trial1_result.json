  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states the transcript 'does not provide information regarding the chronological order of symptom onset' when P-2 and P-4 clearly establish the cough started 4-5 days ago. It claims 'no mention...regarding duration' when the transcript explicitly states durations. It states no information about 'changes in severity' when D-7/P-7 clearly address this ('stayed the same'). It incorrectly claims no comparison to prior experiences when P-24 provides detailed comparison. These are fundamental factual errors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the vast majority of key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) specific 4-5 day duration of cough, (2) sequential onset pattern with runny nose developing 2-3 days later, (3) cough staying the same in severity, (4) non-productive nature confirmed, (5) clear nasal discharge, (6) patient's statement about never having this type of cough before, (7) previous runny noses being shorter, (8) mother's confirmation of no wheezing history. Coverage is well below 20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates poor faithfulness to the transcript. It makes multiple false negative claims stating information is 'not provided' or 'does not contain' when that information is explicitly present in cited exchanges (P-2, P-4, D-7/P-7, D-11/P-11, P-24). This represents systematic failure to accurately report what is verifiable in the source material, though it doesn't add fabricated content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the general topic areas asked about in the question (symptom development, timing, duration, severity changes, comparison to prior). However, by incorrectly claiming information is absent rather than extracting and reporting the actual information present, it fails to provide meaningful answers to the specific question components. The structure attempts relevance but the content is largely non-responsive."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates severe deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It systematically fails to extract information that is explicitly present in the transcript, making false claims that key information 'does not provide,' 'is not mentioned,' or 'does not contain' details that are clearly stated in multiple patient and doctor exchanges. This results in missing virtually all key clinical details about symptom onset (4-5 days for cough, couple days for runny nose), progression (stayed the same), characteristics (dry, non-productive, clear discharge), and comparison to prior history (never had dry cough like this, previous runny noses shorter). The response contradicts the source material through omission and incorrect characterization of what information is available. While it maintains basic relevance to the question topic and doesn't fabricate information, it fails to provide accurate, complete, or faithful documentation of the patient's symptom timeline."
