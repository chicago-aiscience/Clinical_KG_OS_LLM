  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that information on how triggers relate to the current exacerbation is absent from the transcript, despite triggers being explicitly mentioned in P-9 and P-11 in context of increased bronchodilator use (P-8, P-9). It denies the doctor's suspicion of undiagnosed allergies, contradicting D-12 ('so you have allergies too?'), P-12 (patient suspects), and D-13 ('that would make sense'), which Gold Answer accurately cites. It hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' not present. Family history match is correct, but overall significant contradictions with Gold Answer's facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) three triggers with citations (P-9, P-11) - missed/denied; (2) no other triggers (P-10) - missed; (3) pollen leading to allergy suspicion/discussion (D-12-P-12, D-13, D-31-P-31) - denied/missed; (4) family sister asthma (P-32) - covered; (5) relevance to exacerbation via escalated inhaler use (P-8) - partially covered but denied causal link; (6) clinician med change suggestion (D-43) - missed. Covers ~20-30% (family, some exacerbation details).",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms (P-1, P-15) verifiable with accurate citations. Family history (P-32) verifiable. However, falsely claims triggers/exacerbation relation absent (present in P-9/P-11/P-8); denies allergy suspicion (evident in D-12/D-13); repeatedly references non-existent 'knowledge graph' as source - clear hallucination. Multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on relating specific triggers + family history to exacerbation and allergy suspicion. Generated dodges triggers (claims impossible), partially covers family/exacerbation symptoms/treatment but irrelevantly expands on symptoms not central to question, denies allergy suspicion, adds off-topic 'knowledge graph' analysis. Partially relevant via family/exacerbation but largely evades core query."
