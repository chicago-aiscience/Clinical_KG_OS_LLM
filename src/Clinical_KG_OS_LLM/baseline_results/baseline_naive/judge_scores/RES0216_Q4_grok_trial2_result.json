  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as 'cardiac ischemic pictures' matching Gold [D-36]. It accurately notes tightness rather than pain/out-of-breathness [D-36, P-1/P-5], and absence of pain and exertional SOB [D-36]. Minor discrepancy: misphrases 'tightness rather than out-of-breathness' (doctor said not out of breath, more tightness), and attributes SOB absence primarily under absence rather than nature; core facts align without major errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers: condition (100%), nature of complaints (tightness not pain/SOB [D-36, P-1/P-5]). Misses: specific absences of anxiety/sweaty/impending doom [D-6/P-6], clinician screening [D-5/D-6], nuance of some dyspnea [P-7], patient relief [P-35]. Covers ~85% of key points (strong on condition/nature/absence of pain/SOB, partial on absences).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: condition [D-36], tightness description [P-1], no SOB/pain [D-36], patient reports [P-1/P-5]. Citations accurate to transcript; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by specifying condition and categorizing evidence into nature of chest complaints (tightness vs. SOB) and absences (pain, SOB), with no off-topic content."
