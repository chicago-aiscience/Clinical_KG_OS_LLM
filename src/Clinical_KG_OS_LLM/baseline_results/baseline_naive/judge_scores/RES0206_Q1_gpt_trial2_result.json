  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most reported acute symptoms match the Gold Answer and transcript: increased cough, increased green/yellow sputum, small blood with hard coughing (hemoptysis), and worsened shortness of breath; also possible fever/feeling hot and sinus pressure; and identifies cough as most bothersome. The main factual issue is labeling “high blood pressure” as a systemic symptom of the acute 3‑day worsening—this is a chronic comorbidity (P-22), not an acute symptom of the exacerbation. Otherwise, statements are consistent with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covers several key Gold Answer items (cough, sputum change, hemoptysis, dyspnea, possible fever, sinus pressure, most bothersome=cough) but misses: reduced exercise tolerance/functional limitation (P-4) and mild headache (P-14). It also omits the Gold Answer’s pertinent negatives (e.g., no sore throat, no GI symptoms, no night sweats, no smell/taste change, no confusion, no myalgias). Overall coverage is roughly in the 50–79% range of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all claims are directly supported by the transcript with correct attribution. The inclusion of hypertension is transcript-supported as a past diagnosis but is not faithful to the question’s framing (acute symptoms); still, it is not a fabricated detail. No clear hallucinations beyond this misclassification.",
    "relevance": "Answer is largely focused on the asked respiratory and systemic symptoms and the most bothersome symptom. However, inclusion of “high blood pressure” as an acute systemic symptom is not relevant to the acute 3-day worsening."

  "summary": "The generated answer accurately captures the main acute respiratory complaints and identifies cough as most bothersome, but it omits reduced exercise tolerance and headache and inappropriately includes chronic hypertension as an acute systemic symptom."
