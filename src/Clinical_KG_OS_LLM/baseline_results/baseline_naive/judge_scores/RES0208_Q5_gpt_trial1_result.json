  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It explicitly states there is “no mention” of the grandson contact/daycare/cold symptoms and “no mention” of travel or in-person client visits, but these are clearly present in the transcript ([P-23], [D-24]/[P-24], [P-31], [D-32]/[P-32]). While it correctly summarizes some symptoms (feverishness, loss of taste, developing dry cough) and the doctor’s impression of possible infection/COVID ([D-36]) and planned tests ([D-37]), it directly contradicts the central exposure-history facts the question asks about.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed: (1) grandchildren visited last weekend; grandson had a cold and attends daycare; family didn’t know he was sick ([P-23]); (2) doctor asked about travel outside the province and patient denied ([D-24], [P-24]); (3) occupational exposure explored—financial advisor mostly from home, occasional in-person elderly clients—but none in prior week/3–4 days; last seen a couple weeks ago ([P-31], [D-32], [P-32]); (4) conclusion that with other exposures excluded, grandson visit was the main identifiable source supporting infectious assessment ([D-36]). Generated Answer includes only general symptom-to-infection linkage and next steps, which does not cover the exposure-pathway content asked.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple major unfaithful claims: asserting absence of grandson exposure, travel questioning, and client-visit history—each is explicitly in the transcript. The symptom and plan details it does mention are grounded in cited lines, but the central “no mention” assertions are contradicted by the source, making the answer largely ungrounded overall.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks how the grandson contact and other exposure pathways were considered/excluded. The Generated Answer largely avoids/denies these exposures and instead summarizes symptoms and diagnostic planning. This is only partially responsive to the question."
