  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies the condition the doctor wanted to rule out as COVID-19 and correctly states the test ordered was a COVID swab (matches D-43).\n- Incorrectly states the transcript does not explicitly list details about recent social contacts. The transcript clearly includes a sick contact during outdoor dog walks (P-20) and uncertainty about whether that contact had a COVID test (P-21).\n- Substitutes a different rationale (symptoms like fever/sputum) for the asked-for social-contact detail; while symptoms are in the transcript, they are not the specific prompting contact detail emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer:\n- Condition to rule out: COVID-19 ✅\n- Test ordered: COVID swab ✅\n- Prompting social-contact detail: walks dogs with friends; one friend was sick; sometimes walked too close; unsure if friend tested ❌ (missed)\n- Additional COVID screening questions (smell/taste, etc.) and travel history: not required by the question but included in Gold Answer; not mentioned ❌\n\nOverall: Covers 2 of the 3 required elements; misses the crucial contact-exposure detail.",
    "faithfulness": "- The answer is partially grounded (fever P-9; sputum/cough/SOB P-1; COVID swab D-43).\n- However, it contains a clear contradiction/hallucination relative to the transcript by claiming the transcript does not explicitly list social contact details, when it does (P-20, P-21).\n- The provided ‘prompting detail’ is not what the question asked for and omits the actual transcript-based exposure description.",
    "relevance": "- Addresses the exact condition and test requested.\n- The third component (social-contact detail) is not answered as asked and is replaced by symptom-based reasoning, reducing direct relevance.\n- No major unrelated tangents beyond that substitution."
