  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s medication for epilepsy, consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer (P-23, P-8). It also correctly states the patient forgot to take the medication (P-9). However, it fails to provide the specific circumstance that led to the missed dose (daughter’s birthday celebration / altered dinner routine), which is required by the question and present in the Gold Answer (P-24). The mention of a “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript, though it does not change the clinical facts.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) medication = Keppra; (2) general reason = forgot dose. Misses key Gold Answer detail: the specific situational trigger was the daughter’s birthday celebration and change in routine (celebration earlier, no usual dinner time) leading to forgetting (P-24). Also omits that this was characterized as an isolated lapse rather than ongoing adherence difficulty (D-24, P-24) and the patient’s statement that missing it likely contributed to the seizure (P-9). Overall, it captures only a portion of the required details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (Keppra, epilepsy, forgot). The claim that this is “supported by the knowledge graph” is not in the transcript and is an unverifiable add-on. No other major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked items (current medication and why a dose was missed). It is relevant but incomplete regarding the specific circumstance."
