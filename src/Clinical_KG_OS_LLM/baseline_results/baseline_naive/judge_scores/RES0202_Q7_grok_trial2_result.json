  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer's description of the illness progression: cough onset on Wednesday evening after school (fine initially), increasing severity (little on Wed, a bit worse Thu, worse Fri), fatigue emerging Thursday ('really tired'), fever first on Friday (over 100°F), and decreased appetite on Friday. No factual errors or contradictions; minor omissions like 'dry' cough qualifier or exact phrasing do not constitute inaccuracies. All presented facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: 3-day timeline (Wed-Thu-Fri), cough first Wed night after fine at school, severity progression (Wed little, Thu worse, Fri worsening), fatigue Thu ('really tired' [P-1]), fever Fri first time [P-1,P-2], decreased appetite Fri [P-15,P-17]. Missed: 'dry' cough specifier, mild runny nose Fri [P-16], significant fatigue reiterated Fri [P-25], mother's stepwise summary [P-12], 3-day correction [P-4]. Covers ~85% of key points (core evolution and queried symptoms fully, minor details omitted).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: cough Wed night [P-1], worse Thu + tired [P-1], worse Fri + fever [P-1,P-2], appetite/breakfast [P-15,P-17]. No hallucinations, fabrications, or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response day-by-day (Wed eve to Fri), specifying cough onset (Wed night), severity changes over three days (progressive worsening), and emergence of fever (Fri) plus queried other symptoms (fatigue Thu, decreased appetite Fri). No off-topic content or tangents."
