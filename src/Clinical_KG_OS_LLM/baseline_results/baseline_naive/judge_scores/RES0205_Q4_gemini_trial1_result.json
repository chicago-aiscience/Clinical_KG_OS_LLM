  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the timing of the COVID-19 test. However, the transcript explicitly states in [P-36]: 'I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.' This is a significant factual error regarding a specific part of the user's question.",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete regarding workplace concerns. It only mentions that coworkers are scared, missing key details from the Gold Answer and transcript: the patient's role as a hospital clerk [P-34], the use of PPE and infection control awareness [P-17], and the patient's specific desire to return to work only once the cough has ceased [P-36].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucinated claim of omission, stating the information about test timing is not in the transcript when it is clearly present in [P-36]. This constitutes a failure to accurately reflect the source text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to address every specific component of the multi-part question, even though the content provided is inaccurate or incomplete."
