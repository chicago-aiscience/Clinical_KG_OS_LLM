  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that there is 'no mention' of the grandson, daycare, cold symptoms, travel, or client visits in the transcript. However, these are clearly present: grandson/daycare in [P-23], travel in [D-24/P-24], and client visits in [P-31/P-32].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 100% of the key points requested by the prompt. It fails to discuss the timing of the grandson's visit relative to symptom onset and fails to list the excluded exposure pathways (travel and work), claiming they were not mentioned.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails the faithfulness check by hallucinating that the transcript is missing information that is clearly provided. It contradicts the source text directly.",
    "relevance": "The answer fails to address the question. Instead of explaining the connection between the grandson's cold and the infection assessment, it provides a generic summary of symptoms while denying the existence of the specific evidence requested."
