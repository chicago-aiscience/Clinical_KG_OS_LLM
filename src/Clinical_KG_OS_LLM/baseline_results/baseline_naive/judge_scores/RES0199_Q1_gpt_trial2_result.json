  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual inaccuracies relative to the Gold Answer/transcript. While it correctly notes the cough started four days ago and that the patient had nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and headache, it incorrectly states that key characteristics were “not described” or “not specified,” despite them being explicitly documented in the transcript: cough was mostly dry with no sputum/blood; diarrhea was liquid stools 5–6 times/day; vomiting occurred twice (no blood, food contents); headache severity was rated 7/10. These are major errors that contradict the transcript/Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It misses most of the requested specifics from the Gold Answer: (1) nature of cough (dry, no sputum/blood, stable), (2) diarrhea frequency (5–6/day, liquid stools, no blood), (3) vomiting episode count (two, no blood, food contents), and (4) headache severity rating (7/10). It also omits several pertinent associated negatives (e.g., no SOB/wheezing/chest pain; no appetite change/bloating/constipation) included in the Gold Answer. Overall it covers only a small fraction of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Although the answer does not add many new invented details, it repeatedly claims that details were not present in the transcript when they clearly were. These incorrect denials (dry cough, diarrhea frequency, vomiting count, headache severity) represent unfaithful reporting relative to the source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic (GI and respiratory symptoms and requested characteristics), but it fails to actually provide the requested characteristics and instead repeatedly states they are unavailable. This makes it only partially responsive to the question."
