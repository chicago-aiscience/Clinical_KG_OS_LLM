{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 (referred to as Covid) as the alternative diagnosis due to symptom overlap (cough and shortness of breath), matches the specific test (covid swab), and the turnaround time (24 to 48 hours), all consistent with the Gold Answer and directly from [D-52]. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), symptom overlap (cough, shortness of breath; Gold adds chills but not essential), diagnostic test (COVID swab), and turnaround time (24-48 hours). 100% coverage of core elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52] (Covid overlap, swab, 24-48 hours); symptoms mentioned (cough, shortness of breath) are from patient's reports (e.g., [P-1], [P-5], [P-8]). Reference to 'knowledge graph information' is extraneous but does not introduce ungrounded facts about the case.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is perfectly structured and focused on the three-part question (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time), with no off-topic content."
