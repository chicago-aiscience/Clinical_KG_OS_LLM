  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies key clinical findings from early dialogue (headache in D-2, fever in D-7, night sweats in D-9) rather than the doctor's actual end-of-visit summary in D-58, which recaps dry cough for 3-4 days, fever, headache, no sputum, no recent sick contacts except brother 2 weeks ago, no asthma, and Claritin only; it also misstates Jessica's goal as concluding the appointment (citing wrong P-59), contradicting Gold's accurate recap of her wanting to know if she needs medicine (P-60). Major factual errors throughout.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers 5 specific recap points from D-58 plus Jessica's goal (needs medicine?, go home/lay down); Generated covers none of these, instead listing unrelated early symptoms and fabricating a different goal, achieving <20% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about headache, fever, night sweats are from early questions, not D-58 summary; 'knowledge graph' is hallucinated (absent from transcript); Jessica's goal mis-cited (P-59 is unrelated 'No' to drugs); largely fabricated, not grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Attempts to address doctor's recap and Jessica's goal but focuses on wrong transcript sections (early symptoms, end questions) and invents unrelated elements like knowledge graph, making it largely off-topic for the specific 'end-of-visit summary' and 'primary goal for next steps'."
