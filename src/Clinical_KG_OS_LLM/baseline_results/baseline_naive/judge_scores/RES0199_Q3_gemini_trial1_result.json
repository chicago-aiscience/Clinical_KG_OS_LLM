  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the primary condition to rule out (COVID-19), the core symptoms reported (headache, cough, GI issues), and the specific characteristic symptom (loss of smell).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the gold answer: it does not mention 'fatigue' as part of the symptom list, and it omits the 'pertinent negatives' (absence of fever, runny nose, or muscle aches) which the gold answer includes as part of the clinical picture.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms and claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and specific turn references (D-52, P-1, P-24).",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question without including unnecessary information."
