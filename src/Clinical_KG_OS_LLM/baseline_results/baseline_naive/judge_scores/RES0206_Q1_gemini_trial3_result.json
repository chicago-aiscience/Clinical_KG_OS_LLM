{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the respiratory symptoms and most bothersome symptom. However, it incorrectly lists 'High Blood Pressure' as a systemic symptom reported during the 'acute 3-day worsening'. According to the transcript [P-22], high blood pressure is a pre-existing chronic condition, not an acute symptom of the current exacerbation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several points from the Gold Answer: 1) Reduced exercise tolerance (difficulty walking the dog/block) as a respiratory/functional symptom. 2) Mild headache as a systemic symptom. 3) The extensive list of pertinent negatives provided in the Gold Answer (denial of sore throat, nausea, etc.). It covers about 60-70% of the symptom-related content.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript in that all information provided (including the blood pressure) exists in the text. There are no hallucinations, though the categorization of blood pressure as an acute symptom is a contextual error.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the components of the user's question regarding respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, and the most bothersome symptom."
