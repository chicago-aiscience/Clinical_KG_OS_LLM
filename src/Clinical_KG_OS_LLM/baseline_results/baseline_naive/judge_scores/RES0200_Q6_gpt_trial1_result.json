  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the key elements of the doctor’s plan in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG; chest X-ray; oxygen saturation measurement with oxygen PRN; continuation of bronchodilators; addition of steroids and antibiotics; and COVID swab. Minor wording differences (e.g., saying “prescribed” rather than “will give”) do not change the meaning. Categorizing the COVID swab under “monitoring” rather than “laboratory tests” is a minor organizational issue, not a factual error.",
    "completeness": "Covers the major COPD exacerbation management components from the Gold Answer: all labs in [D-52] (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG), COVID swab, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring with oxygen as needed, continuation of bronchodilators, addition of systemic steroids and antibiotics. Misses the additional monitoring point from [D-37] noted in the Gold Answer: ongoing blood pressure monitoring due to self-discontinued antihypertensive and kidney complication caution. Therefore not fully complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included items are grounded in the transcript: tests and treatments come directly from [D-52], and Ventolin/Spiriva are supported by [P-11]. No clear hallucinated tests, imaging, or therapies beyond what is stated. The only notable omission is [D-37], not an invented detail.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing laboratory tests, imaging, monitoring procedures, and therapeutic interventions (steroids, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, continuation of bronchodilators). No significant irrelevant content."
