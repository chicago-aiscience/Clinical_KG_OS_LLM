{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with both the transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies school as the suspected source, the timeline of symptoms starting after school on Wednesday, the absence of known sick contacts outside of school, and the lack of notification from the school regarding exposures.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main components of the question. However, it misses a few details present in the Gold Answer: 1) The mother's specific phrasing that it was 'kinda hard to say' if there were sick contacts at school. 2) The detail about the school requiring a COVID test to return to inform other families. 3) The context of excluding travel and environmental factors as a way to narrow down the school as the likely source.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is faithful to the transcript. Every claim made is supported by the text. It avoids hallucinating details not present in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question (school attendance as a source, sick contacts, and school notification) without including off-topic information."
