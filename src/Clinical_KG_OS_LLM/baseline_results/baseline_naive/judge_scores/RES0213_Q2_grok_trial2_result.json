  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the three OTC medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) tried for chest pain and their ineffectiveness, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-6]. It correctly identifies the multivitamin as the regular supplement [P-25]. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer; omissions are addressed in completeness.",
    "completeness": "Covered: three OTC pain remedies (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), their ineffectiveness, daily multivitamin as regular routine. Missed/partial: explicit statement of no prescription medications [D-25, P-25], full stress management details (leisure reading, nervousness about running lately [P-28]), quitting smoking efforts [P-13, P-14, P-18]. Covers approximately 60% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: pain medications and ineffectiveness [P-6], multivitamin [P-25], running routine [P-28]. No hallucinated facts; descriptions like 'regular daily health regimen' and 'regular physical routine' are plausible summaries grounded in context.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses OTC medications/supplements for pain and routine (pain remedies, multivitamin, effectiveness), with a minor tangent on running as routine activity (not medication/supplement but mentioned in Gold under stress management). Mostly focused on the question."
