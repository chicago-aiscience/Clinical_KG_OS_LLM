  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely inconsistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. It incorrectly states there was no information about a prior medication tried; the patient explicitly reported trying OTC “decongestants” [P-10]. It also misstates the patient’s assessment of effectiveness by using a general “not getting any better” comment from [P-1], whereas the transcript indicates partial benefit: “that worked a little bit” [P-10]. The only correct element is the doctor’s recommendation of an OTC product “like Tylenol cold” [D-39].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points:\n- Patient tried OTC decongestants: MISSED.\n- Patient felt it helped “a little bit” (stuffy → runny): MISSED.\n- Doctor recommended OTC meds like Tylenol Cold: INCLUDED.\n- Supportive care/hydration and expectation of “few weeks” for improvement: MISSED.\nOverall, it captures only a minority of the required details.",
    "faithfulness": "The response cites transcript lines, but it makes a major claim that is contradicted by the transcript (that there is no information about prior medication tried). This is not a minor omission; it is directly refuted by [P-10]. The effectiveness assessment is also not faithful to [P-10], replacing it with a different statement from [P-1] that does not answer the specific question about the medication’s effect.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address all three parts of the question (what tried, perceived effectiveness, what recommended). However, two of the three parts are answered incorrectly, and it omits key recommended supportive measures. Still, it remains focused on the asked content without tangents."

  "summary": "The response is relevant and correctly identifies Tylenol Cold, but it incorrectly denies and fails to extract the patient’s reported use and partial benefit of decongestants, leading to low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness."
