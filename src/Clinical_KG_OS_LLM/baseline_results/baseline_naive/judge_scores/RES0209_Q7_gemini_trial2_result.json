  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the age of diagnosis (8) and the duration of the current exacerbation (2 weeks), as well as the primary symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is significantly incomplete. It fails to include specific quantitative data requested in the prompt and present in the Gold Answer (usage frequency of once every two weeks vs. five to six times per week). It also misses the patient's current age (10), specific triggers (exercise, cold air, seasonal pollen), additional symptoms (chest tightness, nighttime symptoms), and the observation that wheezing occurs more frequently than medication use.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical information provided in the Generated Answer is found in the transcript. The inclusion of '[KG]' citations suggests a reliance on an external knowledge graph mentioned in the prompt instructions, but it does not introduce any non-clinical hallucinations regarding the patient's specific case.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question regarding the evolution of the condition. However, it glosses over the specific periods and metrics explicitly mentioned in the prompt (the specific frequencies), providing a high-level summary instead of the detailed evolution requested."
