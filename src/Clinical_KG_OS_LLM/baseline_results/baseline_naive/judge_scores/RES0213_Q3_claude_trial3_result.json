  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety as the diagnosis, which aligns with the Gold Answer's conclusion of 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' However, it lacks some nuance - the Gold Answer emphasizes that pain resolves with distraction/social interaction and occurs when 'alone with thoughts,' while the Generated Answer mentions this less explicitly. The core diagnostic conclusion is accurate.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of key points from the Gold Answer. It includes: (1) situational pattern with studying/walking, (2) history of teenage anxiety attacks, (3) academic stress as trigger, and (4) some differential considerations. However, it MISSES several critical Gold Answer points: the specific resolution pattern when distracted/with people [P-9, P-29], the 'makes herself nervous' and breathing faster detail [P-19], the explicit 'could maybe return' anxiety statement [P-22], palpitations only during anxiety [P-20], and comprehensive pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, occurs at rest, no asthma).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, there are concerns: (1) The statement about 'reading books at night' [P-28] is incorrectly framed as evidence that distraction helps - the patient mentions this as a stress management technique, not as something that resolves chest pain. (2) The Knowledge Graph references appear fabricated or from external sources not provided in the transcript. (3) The claim that 'engagement in non-academic activities helps mitigate symptoms' is inferential rather than directly stated. Most core claims are verifiable, but some interpretive leaps lack direct transcript support.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about diagnosis and supporting clinical observations. It stays focused on the anxiety diagnosis and provides specific evidence. However, it includes some tangential content about analgesics and differential reasoning regarding cardiac risk factors that, while related, dilutes the focus on the specific situational pattern and psychological factors that the question emphasizes. The response is mostly relevant but could be more tightly focused."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety as the diagnosis and provides several valid supporting observations from the transcript, including the situational triggers (studying/walking), history of teenage anxiety, and academic stress. However, it misses key clinical details emphasized in the Gold Answer, particularly the specific pattern of symptom resolution when distracted or engaged with others, the 'alone with thoughts' characteristic, breathing pattern observations, and comprehensive pertinent negatives. There are also faithfulness concerns regarding Knowledge Graph references that appear fabricated and some interpretive statements lacking direct transcript support. While the core answer is correct and relevant, the incomplete coverage of supporting evidence and some unsupported claims limit its overall quality."
