  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not provide information on the chronological order, duration, severity changes, or prior experiences. In contrast, the Gold Answer and the transcript clearly state: the cough lasted 4-5 days [P-2], the runny nose lasted a 'couple of days' [P-11], the severity 'stayed the same' [P-7], and the patient explicitly compared this to prior health [P-24].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points requested by the question. It misses the 4-5 day duration of the cough, the 2-day duration of the runny nose, the lack of change in severity, and the patient's comparison to previous illnesses.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that information is missing from the transcript when it is actually present. It claims there is no mention of duration or severity changes, which is directly contradicted by statements in [P-2], [P-11], and [P-7].",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer uses the correct headings to address the prompt, it provides no relevant clinical information, instead offering a series of incorrect claims that the information is unavailable."
