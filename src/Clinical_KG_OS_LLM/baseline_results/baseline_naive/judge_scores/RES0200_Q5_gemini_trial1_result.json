  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It claims that 'no data regarding the patient's personal smoking history or family history of lung cancer is present', whereas the transcript explicitly mentions the patient smokes half a pack a day, used to smoke up to 2 packs, and their father had lung cancer and smoked a lot (P-43, P-44).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses 100% of the key points required by the prompt. It fails to provide the smoking consumption levels, the changes over time, or the family history details found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer makes a false claim about the source material by stating the information is missing. This is a significant hallucination of absence.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer fails to address the specific question asked. Instead of answering about smoking and family history, it provides a summary of symptoms and treatment plans which were not the focus of the query."
