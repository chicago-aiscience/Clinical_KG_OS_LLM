{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to be ruled out, the ordered COVID swab test, the 48-hour turnaround time, and the instruction to isolate at home and not see anyone else. These align with the Gold Answer and the transcript. No inaccurate statements are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) COVID-19 rule-out, (2) COVID swab test, (3) results expected in 48 hours, (4) isolate at home/avoid others. Missing/minimally addressed: the doctor’s statement that the swab would be done “today” and that the patient would receive “further instructions from public health” once results returned.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript citations (P-1, D-39). No hallucinated diagnoses, tests, timelines, or additional instructions are added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays tightly focused on the question components (condition to rule out, test, turnaround time, and interim instructions) with no tangential content."
