  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that specific details of the smoking history (pack-a-day since age 15, cited in [P-37][P-38]) and occupational role (engineering consultant at chemical plant, [P-33][P-34]) were not elicited during the consultation, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the family history ([P-42]) but fails to explain how any risk factors relate to the presentation as in the Gold Answer, which links them to infection risk, COPD, and malignancy vigilance. Major factual errors throughout.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers all three risk factors with details, citations, and relevance to presentation (smoking impairs clearance/increases infxn/COPD/ca risks; occupation mitigates but possible exposure; family adds predisposition; hemoptysis warrants ca vigilance). Generated covers only family history partially (no full relevance), denies smoking/occupation, ignores collective relation and most explanations. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims of no smoking/occupation details are false and ungrounded (directly contradicted by [P-37][P-38][P-33][P-34]); hallucinates 'knowledge graph' repeatedly (not in transcript); correctly cites some symptoms/family but fabricates absences and symptom linkages via non-existent KG. Multiple hallucinations and inaccurate citations to transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Question asks specifically for relation of three named risk factors to presentation and elicited details; Generated denies two risks exist in transcript, covers family minimally without relation, diverts to extensive symptom description unrelated to risks. Partially relevant via family mention but largely off-topic."
