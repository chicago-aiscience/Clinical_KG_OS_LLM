  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main respiratory symptoms reported by the mother at presentation: wheezing, shortness of breath, and a slight cough, and it also captures activity-related breathlessness and “hard time catching her breath.” However, it is not fully correct on the timeline of earliest symptoms: the transcript indicates the earliest symptoms were **wheezing AND difficulty taking in deep breaths** ([P-2]), whereas the Generated Answer states only wheezing was earliest. It also implies a timeline justification based on [P-1] rather than the direct onset question/answer in [D-2]/[P-2].",
    "completeness": "It captures most key respiratory symptoms from the Gold Answer (wheeze, SOB, cough, exertional out-of-breath, difficulty with deep breaths, hard time catching breath). It misses some details present in the Gold Answer (non-productive cough/no phlegm [P-31], and that the child “looks fine otherwise” [P-9]). Most importantly for the question, it incompletely identifies the **earliest** symptoms by omitting “difficulty taking in deep breaths” as an earliest feature.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are supported by the transcript and the cited turns. However, the mention of a “knowledge graph” and its associations is not present in the transcript and is therefore extraneous/unverifiable. The rest of the symptom statements are grounded in [P-1], [P-2], [P-3], and [P-32].",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked items (respiratory symptoms at presentation and which appeared earliest). The brief ‘knowledge graph’ aside is a minor tangent but does not dominate the answer."
