  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer misses key reported symptoms like difficulty breathing (explicitly reported in P-7-P-11 as starting yesterday, constant, worsening) and reduced sense of taste (P-19-P-22, affirmed 'maybe taste a little bit', not denied). It incorrectly treats past mono sore throat as current symptom. For denials, it only lists loss of smell and falsely claims cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, chest pain were not explicitly denied (contradicting explicit 'No' responses in P-15-P-18, P-23). Significant factual errors vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers partial sore throat and swallowing (from P-2-P-4), muscle ache and fatigue (P-25); misses breathing (major), taste change, full details/timelines/worsening. Denied: only 1/7+ (loss of smell), wrongly omits others and adds false note. Covers ~25-30% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable where stated (e.g., sore throat citations accurate), but 'not explicitly denied' for cough etc. is false (direct 'No' in transcript); omits verifiable breathing/taste reports, misreads P-19 as full denial of smell only without noting taste affirmation. Multiple misinterpretations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structured around reported vs denied symptoms matching question; no off-topic content, though inaccurate."
