  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It falsely claims that the transcript does not contain inquiries about nausea, joint pain, or rashes, whereas they are explicitly discussed in [D-10], [D-11], and [D-13]. Furthermore, it provides incorrect citations for sputum production, citing [D-33] and [P-29] which actually discuss family history and asthma, respectively.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses a large portion of the gold answer's key points. It fails to list nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, joint aches, and rashes in the 'denied' category. It also omits 'feeling tired' from the reported symptoms list.",
    "faithfulness": "The response exhibits poor faithfulness by hallucinating that certain parts of the conversation did not occur. It also misinterprets [P-9], claiming the patient confirmed 'sheets are soaked' night sweats, whereas the patient only confirmed feeling hot at night. The citations are largely inaccurate.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant in structure as it attempts to address both reported and denied symptoms, but the content is undermined by the aforementioned inaccuracies."
