  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the patient 'completely lost' their sense of taste. While the patient mentions losing their sense of taste in [P-1], they clarify in [P-4] that they can still taste 'really, really salty foods,' making it a partial loss. The Gold Answer correctly identifies this as a partial loss.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include the specific details requested in the prompt regarding what the patient could and could not perceive (e.g., the ability to smell 'really bad' things, the ability to taste salt, and the inability to taste 'normal things' like bananas). It also misses the duration (two days) and details about the cough being non-productive/consistent.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded only in the first turn [P-1] and ignores the clarifying information in [P-4]. By omitting the later context, it makes a definitive claim ('completely lost') that is contradicted by the patient's later statements. However, it does not invent entirely new symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly attempts to address the question of symptoms and degrees, but it fails to follow the specific instruction to include details about what the patient could or could not perceive."
