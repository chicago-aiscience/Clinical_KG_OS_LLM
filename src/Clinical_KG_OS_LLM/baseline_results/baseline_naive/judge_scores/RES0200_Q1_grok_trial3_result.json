  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately captures endorsed symptoms including worsening cough with exertion (P-1,P-5), increased SOB (P-1,P-8), sputum change from clear-white to yellow (P-6), chest discomfort (P-13), chills (P-29), and multiple specific denials. Generated Answer correctly notes SOB (P-1) and increased cough (P-1,P-5), and some denials (orthopnea P-9, PND P-10, hemoptysis P-7, palpitations P-14), but incorrectly states no sputum changes despite clear description in P-6, denies chills despite P-29 endorsement, misses chest discomfort (P-13), and incompletely lists denials. Significant factual errors on key sputum change and chills.",
    "completeness": "Gold covers: endorsed - worsening cough/exertion, SOB severity, sputum change, chest discomfort, chills/no fever; denies - hemoptysis, orthopnea, PND, palpitations, fever, and many others. Generated covers SOB, increased cough, partial denials (5 examples); misses sputum change, chest discomfort, chills, most other denials, SOB/cough details. Covers ~25-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated correctly cites P-1 for SOB/cough; denies match transcript (P-7,P-9,P-10,P-14). However, fabricates absence of sputum changes (directly contradicted by P-6), absence of chills/systemic (P-29), no hemoptysis detail in sputum section despite P-7; misuses D-52 (doctor summary, not patient endorsement); evidentiary reference inaccurately claims absence from P-1. Multiple hallucinated absences.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response directly around endorsed respiratory/systemic symptoms, sputum character, and denied screened symptoms, mirroring question structure with sections and citations; minor issues with completeness but no off-topic content."
