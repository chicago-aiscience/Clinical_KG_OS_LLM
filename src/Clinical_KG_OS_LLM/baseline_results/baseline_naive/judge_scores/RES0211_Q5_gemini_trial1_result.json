    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that there is no information regarding the family history, brother's cold, or living situation in the transcript. These details are clearly present: Father's allergies (P-33), Cousin's asthma (P-30), brother's cold (P-39, D-58), and living on a farm/home-schooling (P-41, P-42, P-43).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points requested in the question, as it denies the existence of the relevant data and instead provides a generic list of symptoms and a diagnosis from an external 'Knowledge Graph'.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that information is missing from the source. It also refers to a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided transcript. It incorrectly attributes her post-nasal drip solely to her allergies, whereas she mentions her allergies aren't active yet.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. It claims the information is unavailable and then lists symptoms and a diagnosis that were not the focus of the multi-factor inquiry."
