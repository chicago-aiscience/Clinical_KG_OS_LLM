  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists Avodart for prostate enlargement (matching Gold's enlarged prostate/BPH description from transcript P-25/P-26) and Tums for reflux (P-27). The change to reflux regimen (stopped prior med after identifying trigger foods, P-27) matches Gold exactly. Minor addition of 'dutasteride' and 'calcium carbonate' in Gold/Generated are consistent with medication names but not explicitly in transcript; no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: two current meds (Avodart for prostate issue, Tums for reflux), specific conditions, change to prior reflux med and reason (dietary management). Misses Gold's extras like 'dutasteride', '(BPH)', OTC antacid detail, doctor's 'great' response [D-28], and allergies [P-28], but these are not core to the question; 100% coverage of question's required points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Avodart/P-26 for prostate P-25; Tums/reflux/change P-27. Citations accurate. 'Calcium carbonate' for Tums is factual knowledge (Tums composition) but not in transcript (minor unverifiable detail); no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response around current meds/conditions and reflux change/why, perfectly matching question with no tangents or off-topic content."
