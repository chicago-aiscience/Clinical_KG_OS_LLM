  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the dry cough (character, duration approx., daytime frequency), shortness of breath, and wheezing from the transcript and Gold Answer. However, it has significant errors: incorrectly states chest tightness was not reported (contradicts P-20 and Gold), claims no nighttime information (ignores P-18 and Gold's coverage of less frequent nighttime symptoms every other day), and misstates cough duration initially as one week vs. two weeks confirmed. References to non-existent 'knowledge graph' [KG] contradict Gold's transcript-only basis. These are significant factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) dry cough ~2 weeks, almost nonstop daytime (P-1,P-13,P-14); 2) breathing difficulty/short of breath/hard time breathing (P-1,P-19); 3) wheezing a lot, more freq than bronchodilator (P-15,P-17); 4) chest tightness (P-20); 5) daytime prominent vs. nighttime less frequent (every other/2 days, P-18). Generated covers cough details (~75%), breathing difficulty, basic wheezing; misses chest tightness entirely, nighttime frequency/comparison, wheezing-bronchodilator detail, full breathing episode context. Covers ~40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: cough, SOB, wheezing citations accurate (P-1,P-15). But hallucinates 'knowledge graph' [KG] and asthma symptom knowledge not in transcript; incorrectly denies chest tightness despite P-20 'Yes'; denies nighttime info despite explicit P-18 discussion. Multiple unverifiable/misstated claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around requested symptoms (cough character, breathing, wheezing, chest) and day/night frequency; minor extraneous 'knowledge graph' mention but focused on question."
