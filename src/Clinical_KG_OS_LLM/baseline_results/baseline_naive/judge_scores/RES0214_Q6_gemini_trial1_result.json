  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the COVID-19 swab and self-isolation instructions. However, it incorrectly identifies the flu shot inquiry as the concluding step. In reality, the flu shot question [D-53] was part of the history-taking, whereas the concluding 'next steps' were the physical exam [D-52] and consulting with the senior physician [D-55].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two of the four key components found in the Gold Answer: the immediate plan for a physical examination and the clinician's plan to consult with a supervising physician before returning. It covers the specific test and precautionary measures but fails on the 'next steps' regarding the encounter workflow.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript. The mention of the flu shot and isolation are directly supported by [D-53] and [D-54].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, although its identification of 'next steps' is less comprehensive than the Gold Answer."
