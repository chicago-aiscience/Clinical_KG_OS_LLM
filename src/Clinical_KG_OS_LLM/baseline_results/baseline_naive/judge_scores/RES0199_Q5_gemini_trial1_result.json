  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect. It claims the doctor did not explore exposure sources, whereas the transcript (Turns D-45 through D-50) shows the doctor explicitly asking about living situation, environmental triggers (mold, dust, pets), sick contacts, workplace environment, and travel history. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the source text.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the details about the apartment, the car dealership, the travel denial, and the environmental screening because it incorrectly asserts these topics were never discussed.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript. It hallucinates that the doctor bypassed these questions to focus solely on COVID-19 testing, ignoring the half-dozen turns where the doctor systematically investigated the patient's history and environment.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to respond to the prompt, it provides a false negative conclusion that makes the content irrelevant to the actual events of the clinical encounter described in the transcript."
