  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states stuffy nose first 'just before' fever, sore throat around fever onset and ongoing, fever for 3 days, muscle aches concurrent with fever (past 2-3 days, confirmed same time). Generated correctly identifies stuffy nose first, sore throat alongside fever, fever 3 days, but incorrectly states muscle ache 'following' fever (transcript indicates concurrent, past 2-3 days same as fever [P-14, D-15, P-15]). For husband, Gold notes symptoms for past week (~4 days before patient's fever), staggered onset; Generated wrongly claims timeline 'not provided' and 'concurrent' (directly contradicted by [P-19: past week], patient's fever 3 days). Significant contradictions on timings.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: stuffy nose first (covered), sore throat next/around fever (covered), fever 3 days (covered), muscle aches concurrent (timing missed, stated as following), husband past week/4 days earlier/similar ongoing/staggered household transmission (missed entirely, wrongly stated as concurrent/not provided). Covers patient symptoms partially (~70-80%) but misses/inaccurately handles husband comparison, a core question element.",
    "faithfulness": "Stuffy nose/sore throat/fever grounded in [P-1]. Muscle ache cited [P-13] but timing 'following fever' not supported (transcript [P-14] past 2-3 days concurrent with fever [D-15, P-15]). Husband timeline directly in [P-19: past week], yet Generated claims 'not provided'; misuses [D-53] doctor's inference as evidence of concurrency. Multiple misinterpretations/misrepresentations of transcript facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer as chronological list of patient symptoms and husband comparison, perfectly matching question focus with no extraneous content."
