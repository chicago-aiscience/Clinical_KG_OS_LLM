  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate overall, matching the Gold Answer and transcript on the COVID-19 swab test, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and supportive care elements like hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fevers, and pain relief for aches. Minor discrepancy: uses 'analgesics' instead of 'NSAIDs' (transcript 'anseads' likely NSAIDs) and omits results timeframe (24-48 hours) and alternative diagnosis, but no contradictions or errors in stated facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnostic swab (partial, misses 24-48 hr timeframe), 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fevers, Tylenol/analgesics for aches). Missed: exact results timeframe, alternative viral illness diagnosis, explicit NSAIDs, and statement on no prescription meds beyond supportive. Covers ~85% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] of transcript with accurate citations; 'analgesics' is a plausible paraphrase of 'anseads' (NSAIDs), no unverifiable or hallucinated details present.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the complete management plan around the specified elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care) with no off-topic content."
