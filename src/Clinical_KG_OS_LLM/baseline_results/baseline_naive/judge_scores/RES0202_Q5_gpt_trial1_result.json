  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the key facts in the transcript and Gold Answer: (1) the mother suspected school as a possible source of COVID exposure [P-2] with symptom onset after returning from school Wednesday [P-1]; (2) she denied known sick contacts outside school [P-38]; and (3) she stated the school had not contacted them about any exposures [P-39]. The statement that there was no specific information about known sick contacts at school is consistent with the transcript (mother did not identify any specific sick individuals, only that it was “kinda hard to say” due to school attendance [P-38]). No factual contradictions noted.",
    "completeness": "Covers the main points asked: school attendance as suspected source, no known sick contacts outside school, and no school notification of exposures. Misses/understates two Gold Answer details: (1) the mother explicitly said it was “kinda hard to say” regarding school contacts [P-38] (nuance of uncertainty), and (2) the school required a COVID test for return and to manage potential exposure notifications to other families [P-41]. Overall, it captures most but not all key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are supported by the transcript: school suspected source [P-2], attended school before symptoms [P-1], no known outside-school contacts [P-38], and no notification from school [P-39]. No additional fabricated exposures or events are introduced.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers how school attendance factored into suspected source, contrasts school vs outside-school sick contacts, and addresses whether the school notified them of exposures. No meaningful tangents."
