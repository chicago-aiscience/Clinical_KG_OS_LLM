  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains key factual inaccuracies versus the Gold Answer/transcript. Most importantly, it states the initial symptom was a “dry cough and scratchy throat,” implying cough was first or co-initial; however, Jessica explicitly says she first noticed a scratchy throat and then started coughing [P-4]. It also concludes the hot sensation was concurrent with the onset of cough/throat symptoms and “likely began alongside” them; the Gold Answer notes the transcript does not specify exactly when the heat sensation began relative to throat/cough onset, only that it was present during the multi-day illness and felt “all the time” [P-7, P-9]. The Generated Answer is correct that she had symptoms for 3–4 days, had a pounding headache, and described feeling hot constantly day and night.",
    "completeness": "It captures several core symptoms and their general timeframe: 3–4 day duration, throat/cough, headache, and persistent feeling hot. However, it misses/underrepresents other key elements included in the Gold Answer: malaise/feeling “crappy overall” [P-1, P-14] and fatigue/tiredness [P-13]. It also fails to reflect the Gold Answer’s key nuance that the timing of ‘feeling hot’ relative to throat/cough onset is not specified (instead it asserts concurrence). Finally, it does not correctly present the symptom order (scratchy throat → cough).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded in the transcript: (1) claiming the initial symptom included a dry cough conflicts with [P-4], and (2) asserting/inferring that feeling hot began concurrently with the earliest throat/cough symptoms is not stated in the transcript and contradicts the Gold Answer’s emphasis on unspecified relative onset. Other statements (constant hot sensation day/night; headache; 3–4 days) are grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on symptom order/progression over 3–4 days and addresses how the ‘feeling hot’ symptom relates to the cough/throat timeline, with minimal extraneous content."
