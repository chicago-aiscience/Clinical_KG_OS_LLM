  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and omissions. It correctly identifies the sore throat starting 4 days ago and worsening, but fails to mention the critical timeline of difficulty breathing (started 1 day ago), incorrectly states loss of taste as current rather than starting 2 days ago, and misrepresents muscle aches as occurring 'days 2-3' when they actually started 'immediately after' the sore throat. The chronological sequence is substantially inaccurate.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the specific timing of difficulty breathing (1 day ago), which was the most alarming symptom, (2) the correct timing of taste loss (2 days ago), (3) muscle aches starting immediately after sore throat, not days later, (4) the constant nature of breathing difficulty, (5) the distinction between fatigue and weakness. It covers approximately 40% of the key temporal information.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains hallucinations and misrepresentations. It states 'loss of smell (not really)' which contradicts the transcript where smell was NOT affected [P-19]. It incorrectly places muscle aches in 'Days 2-3' when the transcript clearly states they started 'immediately after' the sore throat [P-26]. The chronological structure imposed ('Days 2-3 Leading up to Consultation') is not supported by the transcript's actual timeline.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the chronological order question but does so poorly. It provides some symptom timeline information but misses the most critical recent development (breathing difficulty) and provides an inaccurate sequence. The structure tries to be chronological but fails to accurately represent the temporal progression requested in the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to provide a chronological account but contains multiple critical errors in timeline and severity progression. It omits the most important recent symptom (difficulty breathing starting 1 day ago), misplaces muscle aches in the timeline, incorrectly describes loss of smell, and fails to accurately represent when taste changes occurred. The answer covers less than half the key temporal information from the Gold Answer and includes hallucinated details not supported by the transcript."
