  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states that headache and cough were the first symptoms and began 4 days prior ([P-1]). It also correctly places loss of smell as a late symptom beginning about 1 day prior ([P-24]). However, it inaccurately characterizes the onset of GI symptoms as “approximately three days into the illness” and groups nausea/vomiting/diarrhea together; the transcript specifies diarrhea began ~2 days ago ([P-28]), vomiting occurred yesterday (2 episodes) and nausea persisted today ([P-32]). It also implies the headache/cough course wasn’t detailed, but the transcript explicitly states both headache and cough stayed about the same over the 4 days ([P-9], [P-11]).",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) initial symptoms were headache and cough at day 4; (2) loss of smell began ~1 day before visit.\nKey points missed or insufficient: (1) explicit statement that headache severity remained stable over 4 days and was persistent (and rated 7/10) ([P-8], [P-9]); (2) explicit statement that cough remained stable and was dry ([P-11], [P-12]); (3) accurate GI timeline details—diarrhea started ~2 days ago with 5–6 liquid stools/day ([P-28]), vomiting yesterday x2 and nausea today ([P-32]); (4) question asks specifically how headache and cough changed/remained stable—this was not directly answered, despite being in transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are broadly grounded in the transcript (initial symptoms; smell loss ~1 day; headache described as persistent). But there are multiple deviations: GI symptoms are incorrectly timed and lumped together, and the claim that daily fluctuations were not detailed contradicts explicit transcript statements that both headache and cough stayed the same over four days. These are more than minor paraphrasing issues but not wholesale fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the temporal progression of symptoms and addresses the asked domains (initial symptoms, GI symptoms, smell loss, headache/cough course). However, it under-delivers on the specific requirement to describe how headache and cough changed/remained stable and provides an imprecise GI timeline."
