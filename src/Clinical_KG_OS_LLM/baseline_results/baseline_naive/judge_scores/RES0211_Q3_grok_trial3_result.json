  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key symptoms (dry cough [P-1, P-4], scratchy throat [P-1, P-4], headache [P-1, P-2], subjective fever [P-7, P-9]) and absences (no sputum [P-5, P-6], no GI symptoms [P-11, P-12], no joint pain [P-13]) from the Gold Answer and transcript, explaining their support for URI. However, it omits Gold's mentions of malaise [P-14, D-15], fatigue [P-13], 3-4 day timeline [P-1, P-3], brother's cold [P-39], and doctor's summary [D-58]; introduces a non-existent 'knowledge graph' as source of diagnostic indicators, which is a discrepancy not in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: scratchy throat, dry cough, subjective fever, headache, dry/non-productive cough distinguishing upper airway, absence of GI symptoms (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea), absence of joint pain. Missed from Gold: malaise, fatigue, typical 3-4 day URI timeline, brother's recent cold as exposure, doctor's summary framing. Covers core presenting symptoms and absences (about 70% of Gold's points).",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom claims and citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-7], [P-9]) are verifiable in transcript. Absences verifiable [P-5,6,11-13]. Allergies context verifiable [P-15-18]. However, repeated references to 'knowledge graph'/'clinical knowledge base' and specific [INDICATE] [DIAGNOSIS] mappings are hallucinated/not in transcript; exclusions like pneumonia, arthritis, stomach flu are plausible inferences but not directly stated or cited.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how listed symptoms support URI diagnosis and how absences narrow differential, with structured sections on correlation, context, and exclusions perfectly matching question focus; minor tangent on allergies."
