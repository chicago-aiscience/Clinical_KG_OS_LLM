  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the patient did not try any medications/treatments before the visit (consistent with P-9) and correctly identifies the clinician’s recommended intervention as a COVID-19 swab test and the instruction to self-isolate until results return and possibly longer if symptoms persist (consistent with D-39). It does not introduce major factual errors, but it adds an unverifiable statement about a “Knowledge Graph” and “clinical documentation,” which are not part of the transcript (minor ungrounded content).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) patient had not tried anything/OTC meds; (2) COVID test via swab; (3) self-isolation instructions including potentially continuing if negative but symptomatic. Key points missed: (1) explicit mention that the patient takes no regular medications (D-24/P-24); (2) turnaround time for results (“a day or two”); (3) mention of possible additional tests and consulting the supervising physician (D-40). Overall coverage is substantial but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript (P-9, D-39). However, the final line references “Knowledge Graph information,” which is not present in the transcript and therefore is an ungrounded addition. No other clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer remains focused on what the patient tried and what the doctor recommended, with appropriate mention of the swab test and self-isolation instructions. The only minor tangent is the “Knowledge Graph” statement."
