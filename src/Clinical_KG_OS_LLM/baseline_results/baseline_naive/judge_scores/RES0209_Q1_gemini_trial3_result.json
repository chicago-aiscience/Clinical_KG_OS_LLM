  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the patient did not report chest sensations, whereas the transcript shows the patient confirmed 'chest tightness' in response to the doctor (D-20, P-20). It also incorrectly claims there was no information about nighttime symptoms, while the transcript provides specific frequency details (every other day/two days) and a direct comparison to daytime symptoms (P-18).",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover two major components of the question: chest sensations and the comparison of daytime vs. nighttime frequency. It only successfully covers the cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer makes false claims about the content of the transcript by stating that information regarding chest sensations and nighttime frequency was not provided. These details are clearly present in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in its structure and focus on the question's categories, but its failure to find the actual data within the transcript results in a mostly unhelpful response for the specific details requested."
