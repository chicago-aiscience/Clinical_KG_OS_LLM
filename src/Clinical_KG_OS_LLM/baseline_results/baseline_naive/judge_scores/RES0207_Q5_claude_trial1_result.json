  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding family history. The transcript explicitly includes discussion of family history at D-26/P-26 where the doctor asks about diseases that run in the family and the patient clearly states 'epilepsy runs in the family. My mom had it.' The Generated Answer incorrectly claims no family history information is available, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and source transcript. The medication-related risk factor is correctly identified with accurate citation.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies and explains the medication non-adherence (Keppra missed dose due to daughter's birthday celebration disrupting routine). However, it completely fails to address the hereditary component, which constitutes approximately half of the required answer. The Gold Answer specifically discusses maternal epilepsy history and genetic predisposition, which are entirely absent from the Generated Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major faithfulness violation. It explicitly claims 'There is no information available in the transcript regarding the patient's family history' when the transcript clearly contains this information at P-26 ('Yeah, epilepsy runs in the family. My mom had it'). This represents a failure to identify verifiable information present in the source material. The medication-related portions are accurately grounded in the transcript with proper citations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is partially relevant. It directly addresses one of the two main components of the question (medication-related risk factors) but fails to address the hereditary risk factors and family history relationship to epilepsy diagnosis, which are explicitly requested in the question. The structure attempts to organize information according to the question's framework, but the missing content on hereditary factors significantly reduces overall relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose) as a risk factor for the seizure with appropriate citations. However, it contains a critical error by claiming no family history information is available, when the transcript clearly documents that epilepsy runs in the patient's family through maternal inheritance (P-26). This represents both a factual error and a faithfulness violation, as the answer contradicts verifiable information in the source material. The response covers only half of the required content, missing the entire hereditary/genetic component that forms a key part of both the question and Gold Answer."
