  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the doctor's plan from [D-43], including physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab, labs, vital signs for decision-making, consultation with attending, and clinical impression of COPD exacerbation triggered by infection. Minor discrepancies include not explicitly referencing the earlier temperature check [D-11]/[P-10] as part of vitals and omitting the patient's agreement [P-43], but these do not alter factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam (vitals/chest), COVID swab, labs, clinical impression, disposition criteria (labs/vitals), attending consultation. Missed: specific tie-in to temperature check from earlier dialogue and patient's agreement with plan. Covers approximately 90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-43] of the transcript (physical exam, vitals, chest listening, COVID swab, labs, vital signs, attending discussion, COPD exacerbation by infection). Citations are accurate, and no hallucinated information is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured to address the question, categorizing examinations/tests, consultations, decision criteria, and including the clinical assessment as part of the stated plan, with no off-topic content."
