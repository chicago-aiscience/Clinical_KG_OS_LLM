  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the doctor's assessment of COVID-19 symptoms, the diagnostic test (swab), and the isolation instructions. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not mention a plan to consult with a supervising physician, which contradicts transcript segment [D-40] ('we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today').",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers approximately 60% of the key points. It misses the mention of 'additional tests' [D-40] and the final reassurance [D-41]. It also fails to provide the plan for consulting a supervisor, which was explicitly requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a 'hallucination of absence' by claiming the supervisor consultation is not in the transcript when it clearly is in [D-40]. The other clinical details are faithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and follows the requested structure, addressing the symptoms, diagnostic method, timeline, and isolation. However, its failure to capture the supervisor plan makes it less than perfectly relevant to the specific prompt instructions."
