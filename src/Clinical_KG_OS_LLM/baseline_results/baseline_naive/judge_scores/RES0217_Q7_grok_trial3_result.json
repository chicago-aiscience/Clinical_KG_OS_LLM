  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline elements (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertainty on attachment, >72 hours estimate) and prior episode (bullseye rash, antibiotics, swollen tick). Minor discrepancies include omitting the patient's hope that it was from hiking not gardening, imprecise phrasing like 'more sore' for current symptoms (patient said 'sore in one spot' and 'not as bad'), conflating site swelling with tick engorgement slightly, and missing explicit no bullseye rash now and doctor's grape confirmation. Core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covered: hiking Fri/gardening Sat [P-1], brought tick in container [P-1], uncertain attachment [P-1], >72h [D-6], prior bullseye/antibiotics/quite swollen tick [P-3], current small tick engorgement contrast/little bit not as much [P-3,P-4], local redness/tenderness knee [P-1]. Missed/partial: discovery trigger (soreness 'earlier today' [P-1]), exact location (behind knee joint [P-1,D-1]), hope from hiking not garden [P-1], no larger circle rash [P-6], doctor's non-grape engorgement note [D-4]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: timeline/activities/uncertainty/container from P-1; >72h D-6; prior details P-3; current symptoms/location P-1,P-3; engorgement contrasts P-3,P-4. Citations accurate. Minor interpretive phrasing (e.g., 'more sore') grounded in P-3 ('sore in one spot'), no hallucinations or external inventions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured into Timeline and Comparison sections mirroring question's two parts; all content directly addresses exposure timeline, discovery/presentation, and symptom/engorgement contrasts to prior; no tangents."
