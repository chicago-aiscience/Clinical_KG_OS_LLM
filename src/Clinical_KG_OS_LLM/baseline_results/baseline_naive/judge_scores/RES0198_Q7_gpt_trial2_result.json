  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple major factual errors compared with the Gold Answer and the transcript:\n- It incorrectly states the transcript does not specify which symptom started first. In fact, the patient states, “It felt pretty stuffy at first” [P-3] (congestion first).\n- It incorrectly states there was no shift in predominant symptom; the patient says, “but now it’s mostly running” [P-3] (shift from congestion to rhinorrhea).\n- It incorrectly concludes the symptoms were intermittent rather than constant. While the patient initially said “on and off” [P-1], they later clarified they had been “pretty constant for the past week” [P-8].\n- It introduces an incorrect/unsupported statement about discharge being “a little bit” and cites [P-15], which is about fatigue (“A little bit”), not nasal discharge.\nGiven these contradictions, the answer is largely incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered vs missed:\n- Covered: duration/onset about one week; lack of improvement.\n- Missed/incorrect: (1) which symptom appeared first (congestion), (2) how predominance changed over the week (now mostly runny), (3) the nuanced pattern (initially ‘on and off’ but clarified as ‘pretty constant’), (4) possible contribution of decongestants to symptom change.\nOverall, it covers only a small portion of the required chronology and misstates most of it.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not grounded in the transcript or are mis-cited:\n- “does not specify which appeared first” is contradicted by [P-3].\n- “no shift in predominance” is contradicted by [P-3].\n- “intermittent rather than constant” contradicts [P-8].\n- “discharge was … ‘a little bit’ [P-15]” is a clear misattribution/hallucination (P-15 refers to fatigue).\nThese constitute multiple unfaithful statements.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to address the requested timeline (onset, first symptom, change over week, constant vs intermittent). However, it adds minor irrelevant content (e.g., discharge consistency) and, more importantly, misanswers the core requested elements. Still, the content is generally on-topic."
