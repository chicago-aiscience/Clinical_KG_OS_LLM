  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims there is 'no mention' of the patient's contact with his grandson, the grandson's daycare attendance, cold symptoms, recent travel, or in-person client visits, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and the transcript (e.g., [P-23], [D-24/P-24], [P-31/D-32/P-32]). It fabricates the absence of these key exposure details central to the Gold Answer, resulting in complete factual inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) grandson visit last weekend with cold and daycare ([P-23]); (2) symptoms started 'a couple days' after ([P-1]); (3) doctor acknowledges ([D-24]); (4) no travel outside province ([D-24/P-24]); (5) works mostly from home, no recent client visits in past week ([P-31/D-32/P-32]); (6) supports infection assessment ([D-36]). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying their existence and summarizing unrelated symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that core exposure details are absent despite clear transcript evidence ([P-23] for grandson/daycare/cold; [D-24/P-24] for travel; [D-32/P-32] for clients). Its citations ([P-4], [P-8/P-7], [D-36/D-37]) are accurate for symptoms but irrelevant to the question; the primary claims about 'no mention' are entirely fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question by denying the existence of exposure information but then diverts to a summary of symptoms and doctor's general assessment, which does not connect to the queried exposure pathways or their role in the infection suspicion; includes significant off-topic content on symptoms."
