  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Medication list: Correctly identifies Ramipril (for HTN) and Tylenol (for headaches). It also lists salbutamol, which the patient names [P-25].\n- However, the answer assigns salbutamol to “asthma reoccurring” and relies on a “knowledge graph,” neither of which is in the transcript or Gold Answer.\n- Major error vs Gold Answer on adherence: the patient says the daily controller inhaler is prescribed **morning and night**, but he has been **skipping the night dose for a while** and currently takes it **only in the morning** [P-19]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states a “consistent daily dosing frequency” and does not describe the decreased frequency (BID → QAM).\n- Rescue inhaler availability: correctly notes he didn’t refill it and does not currently have it [P-17, P-18].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered:\n- Lists the three reported medications (salbutamol, ramipril, occasional Tylenol).\n- Links Ramipril to high blood pressure and Tylenol to headaches.\n- Notes lack of current rescue inhaler due to not refilling for a couple years.\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed/incomplete:\n- Does not describe the adherence change of the **maintenance inhaler being prescribed twice daily but reduced to morning-only** (skipping evening dose) [P-19, P-20].\n- Does not clearly capture the “two key adherence gaps” framing (maintenance dose halved + no rescue inhaler), because it omits the first gap entirely.\n- Introduces “knowledge graph” elements not in the Gold Answer/transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "- Multiple statements are not grounded in the provided transcript (e.g., “knowledge graph” references; salbutamol specifically tied to “asthma reoccurring”).\n- The claim of “consistent daily dosing frequency” is contradicted by the transcript, where the patient reports nonadherence to the prescribed BID regimen (skipping night dose) [P-19].\n- The rescue-inhaler non-refill claim is faithful to the transcript [P-17, P-18].",
    "relevance": "- The response is largely focused on the asked items (current meds, indications, and inhaler adherence changes).\n- Minor distraction/irrelevance comes from invoking an external “knowledge graph,” but overall it remains on-topic."
