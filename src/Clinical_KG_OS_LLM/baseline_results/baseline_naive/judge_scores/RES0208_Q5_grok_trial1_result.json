  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states there is 'no mention' of the patient's contact with his grandson, the grandson's daycare attendance, cold symptoms, recent travel, or in-person client visits, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence (e.g., [P-23], [D-24], [P-24], [P-31], [D-32], [P-32]). All facts about exposures are misrepresented as absent, making the answer factually inaccurate throughout.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer—grandson visit last weekend with cold from daycare [P-23], symptom onset timing [P-1], doctor's acknowledgment [D-24], travel exclusion [D-24, P-24], no recent client visits [D-32, P-32], and link to infection assessment [D-36]—are completely missed or denied; Generated Answer covers <20% (none) of these, instead focusing on unrelated symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of core transcript elements like grandson exposure [P-23], travel questions [D-24], and client visits [D-32], which are explicitly present; symptom summary is verifiable but irrelevant, with multiple fabricated denials rendering it largely ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer fails to address the question's focus on grandson contact's connection to infection assessment and explored/excluded exposures (travel, clients), instead denying their existence and pivoting to symptoms, making it entirely off-topic."
