  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the patient's current statin therapy (without name), past antibiotics for a prior tick bite with target rash, and the doctor's proposal for prophylactic antibiotics due to potential >72-hour attachment, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancies include omitting the cholesterol management context, allergies, 10-year timeline for past bite, physician consultation plan, tick lab submission, bloodwork, and insecticide suggestion, but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: current statin [P-15]; past antibiotics for target rash [P-3]; new prophylactic antibiotics proposed [D-6]. Missed or partially covered: cholesterol as reason for physician visits [P-14]; no allergies [P-16, P-17]; 10-year past bite detail; explicit confirmation of moving forward with antibiotics [D-13]; physician consultation [D-13, D-22]; environmental insecticide [D-18]. Covers approximately 70-80% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: statin [P-15], past antibiotics/target rash [P-3], prophylactic antibiotics and >72-hour reasoning [D-6].

    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured to address the question, focusing on current statin, proposed prophylactic antibiotics for tick bite, and relevant past treatment history discussed in the consultation, with no off-topic content."
