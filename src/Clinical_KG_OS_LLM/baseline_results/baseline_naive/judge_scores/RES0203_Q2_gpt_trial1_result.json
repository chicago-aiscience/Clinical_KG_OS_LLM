  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the patient had not tried any treatments/OTC medications prior to the visit and correctly identifies the clinician’s main recommendation: a COVID-19 swab test and instruction to self-isolate until results return, possibly longer if symptoms persist despite a negative test. These points are consistent with the transcript ([P-9], [D-39]). However, it is slightly less precise than the Gold Answer because it says “no information indicating” rather than explicitly citing the patient’s direct denial, and it omits the patient’s statement that they take no regular medications.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) no self-treatment/OTC meds tried, (2) COVID test via swab, (3) self-isolation now until results and potentially longer if symptomatic. Key points missed: (1) the patient confirmed taking no regular medications ([P-24]); (2) turnaround time of results (\"a day or two\") ([D-39]); (3) mention that additional tests might be needed and plan would be discussed with the supervising physician ([D-40]).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (swab testing and isolation instructions). The final sentence referencing a “Knowledge Graph” and linking isolation/testing to a “covid diagnosis” is not present in the transcript and introduces external context; this is a minor ungrounded addition but does not change the core clinical plan described.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on what the patient tried before the visit and what the doctor recommended (test + isolation instructions). The “Knowledge Graph” sentence is mildly extraneous but limited."
