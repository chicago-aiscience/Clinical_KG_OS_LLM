  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer: it correctly states that a COVID-19 swab was ordered, self-isolation was for 14 days, and contact tracing would occur if the test was positive. However, it introduces a small inaccuracy by replacing “NSAIDs” with the broader/less specific term “analgesics” for body aches (the transcript explicitly says “Tylenol or NSAIDs”). It also omits the stated turnaround time for results (24–48 hours), which is part of the plan in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: COVID-19 swab test; 14-day isolation; contact tracing if positive; supportive care—hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, and medication for aches/joint pains. Key points missed/less specific: expected test result timing (24–48 hours); explicit mention of NSAIDs (replaced with “analgesics”); the doctor’s note about an alternative possibility of another viral illness (included in Gold as part of the management discussion, though not explicitly demanded by the question).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by [D-52]. The main faithfulness issue is the substitution of “analgesics” for “NSAIDs,” which is not verbatim from the transcript (though it is directionally similar). Otherwise, the answer does not add major unsupported details.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the asked elements (test, isolation duration, contact tracing condition, supportive care) and does not include irrelevant tangents."
