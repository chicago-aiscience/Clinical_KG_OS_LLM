  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core timeline structure matching the Gold Answer (onset: SOB and fatigue; recent: fever yesterday and taste loss morning; emerging: cough and sore throat), with accurate citations. However, it has factual discrepancies including omission of key onset symptoms like weakness, reduced appetite, 'rundown/super tired' details, laborious breathing description, and body aches (noted in Gold despite unspecified onset); misses loss of smell in morning phase; inaccurately frames headaches as newly emerging despite patient's baseline frequency (Gold notes not clearly different); adds unrequested COVID diagnosis suggestion. Main point of timeline is correct but with some errors/omissions. Score: 3.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Onset (SOB, fatigue/rundown/tired, weakness, reduced appetite, laborious breathing, body aches); Day before (subjective fever); Morning (loss of taste new, diminished smell); Emerging (dry cough 'on its way', sore throat 'starting', mild headaches not different from baseline). Covered: SOB, fatigue (onset); fever, loss of taste (recent); cough, sore throat, headaches (emerging). Missed: weakness, reduced appetite/rundown details, laborious breathing, body aches, loss of smell, newness of sensory symptoms, headache nuance. Covers ~60% of key points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Core timeline claims fully verifiable with accurate citations (P-1 onset, P-4 fever/taste, P-7/8 cough, P-9 sore throat, P-11 headaches). Loss of smell mentioned in clinical context verifiable (P-6). However, 'knowledge graph information' and bolded symptom list indicative of COVID are not in transcript (hallucinated reference, though COVID suspicion plausible from D-36); clinical context extrapolates beyond transcript. Some unverifiable details/hallucinations. Score: 3.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly mirrors question's requested timeline phases (onset couple days ago, recent like fever day before/taste morning, just emerging at consultation) with structured sections directly addressing symptom chronology. Minor off-topic clinical context tangent. Score: 4."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer offers a relevant and mostly grounded timeline reconstruction aligned with the Gold Answer's structure but reduced by omissions of key symptoms like body aches and loss of smell, minor mischaracterizations, and extraneous hallucinated clinical context."
