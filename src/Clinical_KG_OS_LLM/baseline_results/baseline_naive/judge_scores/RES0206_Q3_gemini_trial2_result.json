  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the main symptoms (dyspnea, green-yellow sputum, and fever) and aligns with the Gold Answer's medical logic regarding the dual assessment. However, it incorrectly attributes several points to a 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' which is not present in the source material.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is less comprehensive than the Gold Answer. It misses several supporting symptoms mentioned in the transcript and included in the Gold Answer, such as increased cough frequency, increased sputum volume, decreased exercise tolerance (walking the dog), sinus pressure, headache, and exposure to a sick contact. It also fails to mention the excluded triggers (smoke, dust, medication non-adherence) that the Gold Answer highlights.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' and cites it multiple times as a source for clinical definitions and causal links. These citations are not grounded in the provided transcript or prompt context.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's requirements, focusing on the specific symptoms and how they distinguish between infection and COPD exacerbation."
