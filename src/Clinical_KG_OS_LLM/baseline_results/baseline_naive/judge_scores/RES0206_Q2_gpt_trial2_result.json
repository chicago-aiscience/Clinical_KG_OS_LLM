  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- COPD: Correct that she uses two inhalers (maintenance daily + rescue PRN) and that the rescue is used about once every two weeks at baseline. However, the Generated Answer incorrectly cites [P-1] for rescue inhaler frequency (that detail is in [P-26], not [P-1]).\n- Hypertension: Incorrectly states the transcript does not provide a reason for not taking antihypertensives. In fact, she explicitly says she and her doctor discussed meds and she chose lifestyle modification first, and notes her BP is “OK” now [P-23] with weight loss/walking [P-24].\n- Management strategies: Mentions referral to a lung specialist (true historically), but misses key current strategies noted in the Gold (no home oxygen, lifestyle changes, smoking cessation) which were part of the intended “management strategies.”",
    "completeness": "Key elements in Gold Answer vs Generated Answer:\n- ✅ COPD meds: two inhalers (maintenance + rescue) mentioned.\n- ✅ Inhaler frequency: maintenance daily; rescue ~once every two weeks.\n- ❌ COPD management: did not include “no home oxygen” [P-1].\n- ❌ COPD/lifestyle management: did not include smoking cessation, lifestyle efforts, baseline well-managed status.\n- ✅ HTN diagnosis: acknowledged.\n- ❌ Why no antihypertensive: missing/incorrect (lifestyle-first decision explicitly stated in [P-23], plus weight loss/walking [P-24]).\nOverall, it captures the inhaler schedule but misses a major required part of the question (reason for no BP meds) and several management details.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are grounded in the transcript (daily inhaler, PRN inhaler about every two weeks, HTN history, lung specialist referral).\n- However, the claim that the transcript provides no reason for not being on antihypertensive medication contradicts [P-23], where she clearly gives the reason (trial of lifestyle modification first).\n- Also contains a citation error (rescue inhaler frequency attributed partly to [P-1]).",
    "relevance": "- Largely addresses the question (COPD and HTN meds/strategies and inhaler frequency).\n- The only notable issue is that it fails to answer an explicitly asked component (why no antihypertensives), which reduces relevance somewhat despite staying on-topic."
