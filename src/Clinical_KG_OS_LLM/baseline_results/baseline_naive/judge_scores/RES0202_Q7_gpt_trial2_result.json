  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the timeline described in the transcript and Gold Answer: cough began Wednesday night, worsened Thursday with notable tiredness, and worsened further on Friday when fever (>100°F, possibly 100.1–101°F) and decreased appetite appeared. It does not introduce contradictory or incorrect facts compared with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) cough first appeared Wednesday night; (2) cough worsened Thursday and Friday; (3) fatigue/tiredness noted Thursday; (4) fever first noted Friday with approximate temperature range; (5) decreased appetite/poor breakfast on Friday. Key points missed from the Gold Answer: (a) initial cough described specifically as a “little dry cough”; (b) mild runny nose on Friday; (c) suspected loss of taste associated with breakfast disinterest; (d) the explicit clarification that the duration was 3 days (mother corrected the doctor’s 5-day statement). Overall this is substantial but not full coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript and the cited lines ([P-1], [P-2], [P-15], [P-17]). No clear hallucinations or unverifiable additions are present.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested day-by-day evolution (Wednesday evening through Friday), addressing cough onset and progression, and timing of fever and other symptoms (fatigue and appetite changes)."
