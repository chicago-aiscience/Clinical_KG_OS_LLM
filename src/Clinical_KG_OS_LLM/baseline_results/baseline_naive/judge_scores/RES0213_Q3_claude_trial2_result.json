  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety as the diagnosis, which aligns with the Gold Answer's identification of 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' However, it makes a factual error by attributing the diagnosis to 'clinical documentation and transcript evidence provided' and referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' that is not part of the source material. The core diagnostic conclusion and most supporting evidence are accurate, but this error introduces some inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers several key points from the Gold Answer: situational triggers (studying/walking alone), history of anxiety attacks from teenage years, link to academic stress, and consideration of stress as a cause. However, it misses several important supporting observations: (1) explicit resolution when distracted by social interaction/hands-on tasks [P-9, P-29], (2) patient making herself nervous and breathing faster [P-19], (3) difficulty getting deep breath due to nervousness [P-19], (4) recent stress from Masters thesis deadline [P-15, P-16], and (5) pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, pain at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety, no asthma). Coverage is approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucination issues. It references a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not exist in the source transcript, claiming specific relationships like '[PROCEDURE] studying --[CAUSES]--> [SYMPTOM] chest pain' and '[MEDICAL_HISTORY] smoking --[CAUSES]--> [DIAGNOSIS] heart attack.' These formatted assertions are fabricated. The actual clinical observations cited (P-4, P-8, P-21, P-6) are verifiable in the transcript, but the Knowledge Graph references constitute substantial hallucinated content that undermines faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question, identifying the diagnosis (anxiety) and providing clinical observations that support this reasoning. The answer maintains focus on the core question throughout and connects the patient's symptoms to the diagnosis appropriately. While some of the supporting evidence is fabricated, the answer structure and content remain relevant to what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety as the diagnosis and provides some appropriate supporting evidence from the transcript. However, it suffers from significant hallucination issues by referencing a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' and fabricated relationship structures. The answer covers only about half of the key supporting observations from the Gold Answer, missing important details about symptom resolution with distraction, breathing pattern changes, and pertinent negatives. While the core diagnostic reasoning is sound and relevant, the faithfulness issues and incomplete coverage substantially reduce the overall quality of the response."
