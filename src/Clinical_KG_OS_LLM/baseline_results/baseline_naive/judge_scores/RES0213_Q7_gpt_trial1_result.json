  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies that chest discomfort began about 1.5 weeks ago, is sharp with deep breaths, occurs during studying/walking, lasts ~20 minutes, and that she tried OTC meds without much benefit (all consistent with [P-2–P-7], [P-3], [P-4], [P-6]). It also correctly notes she is currently cutting down smoking and is around ~5 cigarettes/day ([P-14], [P-18]) and that she had teenage anxiety attacks discussed with her family doctor ([P-21], [P-22]).\nHowever, it introduces inaccurate/unsupported causal links (e.g., that smoking/family history “potentially contribut[ed]” to teenage anxiety/chest pain—she denied prior chest pain [P-17]). It also omits or distorts key time-anchored elements (start smoking at ~18; escalation to ~10/day for last 2 years; ~8-year gap since anxiety care; thesis/time-crunch stress in last couple of weeks; father’s heart attack last year), which affects the factual timeline requested.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: current smoking reduction (~5/day); history of teenage anxiety attacks with family doctor visit; recent academic stress; chest pain onset ~1.5 weeks ago; chest pain noticed when studying/walking.\nKey points missed: (1) smoking started around age 18 and was occasional initially; (2) smoking increased to ~10/day for the last ~2 years; (3) cutting down began a few months ago; (4) ~8 years without anxiety symptoms/doctor visits; (5) father’s heart attack last year in his 50s and its role in her worry; (6) stress escalation specifically in the last couple of weeks due to thesis time crunch and nearing end of Masters; (7) link that anxiety may be returning and pain less noticeable when distracted/with others. Overall, substantially less than 80% of the Gold timeline/relations are captured.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “knowledge graph,” the claim that smoking is a known cause of heart attacks (general medical knowledge, not stated by patient), and especially the asserted causal chain that smoking/family history contributed to teenage anxiety/chest pain (contradicted by [P-17] and not stated). The ‘chronic baseline that reacts to stress’ is also speculative. While many symptom details are transcript-based, there are multiple unverified/hallucinated causal assertions.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on the requested timeline (smoking → teenage anxiety → recent academic stress → chest pain onset) and tries to relate phases. Minor distraction comes from ‘knowledge graph’ mentions and added causal speculation, but it remains mostly on-topic."
