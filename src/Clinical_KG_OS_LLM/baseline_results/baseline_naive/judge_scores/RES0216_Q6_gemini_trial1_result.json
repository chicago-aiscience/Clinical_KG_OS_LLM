  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the assessment as asthma recurrence, the exam as listening to the lungs, the intervention as rescue puffers, and the contingency as returning to the table for further investigation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses the doctor's intention to consult with a supervising physician ('the doc') before finalizing the plan, which was explicitly mentioned in the gold answer and transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes a reference to a '[KG]' (knowledge graph) in the physical examination section, which is not present in the source transcript or the provided context. Other claims are well-supported by the transcript citations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including assessment, physical examination, first-step treatment, and the contingency plan."
