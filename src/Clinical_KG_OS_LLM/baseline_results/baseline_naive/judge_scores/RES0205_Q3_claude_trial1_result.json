  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately states the test was negative. However, it lacks some specific details present in the Gold Answer, such as the timeline of testing (two weeks ago at symptom onset) and the patient staying home since testing. The core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the three main components requested: diagnosis investigated (COVID-19), evidence prompting investigation (persistent cough, hospital worker status), and testing results (negative). However, it misses several key details from the Gold Answer: the specific timeline of testing [P-36], the social pressure from coworkers being scared [P-35], the flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose) [P-13, P-14], the patient's use of PPE [P-17], and the patient remaining at home awaiting symptom resolution [P-36]. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations [P-2], [P-5], [P-35] are accurate. The answer does not hallucinate any information, though it could have included more specific citations for additional details like the patient being a hospital worker [P-34, P-17].",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated, what evidence prompted it, and what testing revealed. The response is focused and contains no irrelevant information. However, the evidence section could be more comprehensive to fully address what prompted the investigation."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis and accurately reports the negative test result. It is fully faithful to the transcript with accurate citations and directly addresses the question. However, it lacks completeness compared to the Gold Answer, missing important contextual details such as the testing timeline, social pressures at work, specific flu-like symptoms, PPE use, and the patient's decision to stay home. The answer would benefit from more comprehensive coverage of the evidence that prompted investigation."
