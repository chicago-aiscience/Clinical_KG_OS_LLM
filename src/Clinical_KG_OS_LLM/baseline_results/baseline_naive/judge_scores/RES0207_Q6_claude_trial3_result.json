  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims the transcript 'ends abruptly after [P-23]' and states 'there are no subsequent turns attributed to the doctor,' which directly contradicts the Source Transcript that clearly continues through D-38. The Gold Answer correctly identifies that the doctor outlined next steps in D-37 and D-38, while the Generated Answer falsely claims this information is unavailable. This represents a fundamental error in reading comprehension.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) the doctor would consult with another physician, (2) they would return shortly, (3) possible tests would be discussed, (4) a management plan would be developed, (5) the collaborative decision-making process, or (6) the patient's acknowledgment. Instead, it incorrectly states the information cannot be determined.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript. It claims the transcript ends at P-23 when it actually continues through D-38. It fabricates the claim that 'it is not possible to reference specific evidence' when D-37 and D-38 clearly contain this evidence. The summary section mentions turns that do exist but ignores the critical final exchanges that answer the question.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is completely irrelevant to the question asked. Instead of identifying and describing the next steps communicated by the doctor, it incorrectly claims the information is unavailable. This response does not address what was asked and provides no useful information about the actual next steps, decision-makers, or follow-up actions that were clearly stated in the transcript."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally flawed across all evaluation dimensions. It incorrectly claims the transcript ends at P-23 when it actually continues through D-38, where the doctor clearly outlines next steps including consulting with another physician and returning to discuss tests and management plans. This represents a critical reading comprehension error that renders the response factually incorrect, incomplete, unfaithful to the source material, and irrelevant to the question asked. The answer provides zero coverage of the key points present in the Gold Answer."
