  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies sore throat starting ~4 days ago with severe pain, difficulty swallowing food, fatigue/tiredness, generalized muscle aches, and explicit denial of loss of smell. However, it omits major reported symptoms from the Gold Answer/transcript (notably difficulty breathing starting yesterday, constant and worsening; and reduced sense of taste starting ~2 days ago and constant). It also contains a clear factual error/contradiction with the transcript: it states that cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, and chest pain were not explicitly denied, but the transcript shows the patient explicitly answered “No”/“Nope”/“I don’t think so” when asked about each of these. These are significant inaccuracies relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer positives covered: sore throat; trouble swallowing food; fatigue/tiredness; muscle aches; denial of smell loss. Key positives missed: difficulty breathing (onset yesterday, constant, worsening, never before); reduced taste (onset ~2 days ago, constant); sore throat worsening trajectory. Key negatives missed: explicit denials of cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills/night sweats. Also misses denials of sick contacts and travel (included in Gold Answer). Overall, it captures well under half of the required items.",
    "faithfulness": "Most included statements are grounded in quoted transcript lines with appropriate references. However, the note claiming that cough/runny nose/fever/headaches/chest pain were not explicitly denied is directly contradicted by the transcript, making the answer partially unfaithful to the source despite otherwise accurate excerpts.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the question (reported symptoms and explicitly denied screened symptoms) and does not introduce major off-topic material. However, it fails to enumerate several of the commonly screened symptoms the patient denied, which reduces how well it fulfills the question’s intent while remaining topically aligned."
