  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several major factual errors. It incorrectly claims the doctor's dialogue and plan are missing from the transcript, whereas the transcript clearly includes segments D-1 through D-44, with the plan explicitly stated in D-43. It also misinterprets the patient's mention of a 'runny nose' [P-16] as 'back pain.'",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the vast majority of key points. It fails to identify the doctor's plan (to consult with a supervising physician), misses Tylenol and sputum expectoration as self-care/alleviating measures, and fails to identify any alleviating factors, claiming they are absent from the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The response shows a significant lack of faithfulness to the provided source. It hallucinates that the transcript is missing the doctor's dialogue. It also misrepresents 'back in the day' (referring to a runny nose) as 'back pain.'",
    "relevance": "While the response is structured to follow the prompt's categories, it fails to provide the relevant information requested because it incorrectly asserts that the information is not present in the source text."
