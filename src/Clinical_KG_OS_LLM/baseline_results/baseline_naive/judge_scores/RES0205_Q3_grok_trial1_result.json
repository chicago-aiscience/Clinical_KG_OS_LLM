    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold states COVID-19 investigated, negative result. Generated matches exactly. Evidence in Generated (persistent dry cough [P-2,P-5], hospital worker) is factually accurate and present in transcript/Gold. No errors or contradictions; interpretive phrase 'heighten suspicion' aligns with context without fabricating facts. All facts fully consistent. Score: 5",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1. COVID-19 diagnosis; 2. Patient disclosure [P-35]; 3. Hospital exposure [P-34,P-17]; 4. Flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose) [P-13,P-14]; 5. Persistent cough; 6. Coworkers scared [P-35]; 7. PPE use [P-17]; 8. Test timing [P-36]; 9. Negative result; 10. Stayed home [P-36]. Generated covers: 1,3,5,9 (diagnosis, hospital, cough persistence, negative). Misses 2,4,6,7,8,10 (disclosure detail, specific flu symptoms, coworkers fear, PPE, exact timing, quarantine). Covers ~40-50% of key points. Score: 3",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated verifiable: COVID test/negative [P-35]; cough persistent/dry [P-2,P-5]; hospital clerk [P-34]. 'Heighten suspicion for exposure/communicable infections' grounded in hospital role [P-34,P-17] and cough context [P-35 scared coworkers]. Citations accurate. No hallucinations. Score: 5",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response to question parts (Diagnosis Investigated, Evidence Prompting, Testing Reveal) with no tangents or off-topic content. Perfectly focused. Score: 5"
