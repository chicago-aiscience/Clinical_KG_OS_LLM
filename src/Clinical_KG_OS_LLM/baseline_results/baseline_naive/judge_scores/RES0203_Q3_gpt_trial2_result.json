  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer: suspicion was driven by *loss of smell + loss of taste + dry cough*; test was a COVID swab. Generated Answer correctly identifies loss of taste, dry cough, and that the doctor ordered a swab test due to symptoms being consistent with COVID (D-39). However, it incorrectly omits *loss of smell* as part of the symptom combination leading to suspicion, even though this is a central presenting symptom (P-1) and reiterated by the doctor (D-16). This is a meaningful factual discrepancy about what symptom combination prompted suspicion/testing.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer: (1) triad of symptoms (anosmia, ageusia, dry cough), (2) patient raised COVID concern, (3) doctor explicitly linked symptoms to COVID in D-39, (4) ordered swab test, (5) absence of other symptoms (fever, SOB, sore throat, chest pain) and the doctor’s summary that patient is otherwise well, (6) self-isolation advice while awaiting results. Generated Answer includes (2), (3), and (4), and partially covers (1) but misses loss of smell; it also omits (5) and (6). Overall it covers roughly half of the gold content and misses several clinically important connecting details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (P-1 for taste/cough; D-39 for symptom-consistent reasoning and swab testing). However, the claim that the key symptom combination was only “loss of taste and a dry cough” is not faithful to the encounter summary (D-16: loss of taste/smell and dry cough). Also, referencing a “knowledge graph provided” is not supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question: it explains which symptoms prompted COVID suspicion and identifies the diagnostic test method (swab) with the doctor’s stated rationale (D-39)."
