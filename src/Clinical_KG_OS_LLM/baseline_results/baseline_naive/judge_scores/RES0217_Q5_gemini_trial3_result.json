  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the logic for the 72-hour attachment duration based on the patient's activities on Friday and Saturday. However, it fails significantly on the second part of the question, falsely claiming that the transcript does not mention Strathroy or the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map. These are explicitly discussed in [P-12] and [D-13].",
    "completeness": "The answer only covers the first half of the question regarding the 72-hour duration. It completely misses the geographic justification involving Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme map, which is a key component of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a 'negative hallucination' by asserting that specific information (Strathroy, distribution map) is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present in segments [P-12] and [D-13].",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant to the first part of the query but fails to provide a relevant answer for the second part, instead offering a refusal based on an incorrect assessment of the source text."
