  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly attributes the doctor's suspicion of COVID-19 specifically to sore throat and difficulty swallowing food, claiming the doctor 'cited these specific symptoms' [D-43], but the doctor only vaguely stated 'some of your symptoms are in line with common symptoms of covid 19' without specifying which. It ignores key symptoms like difficulty breathing, fatigue, and muscle aches listed in the Gold Answer. It misstates the patient's smell symptom as 'smell lost,' contradicting the transcript [P-19: 'maybe taste a little bit but not smell'] and Gold Answer, which emphasizes reduced taste WITHOUT loss of smell. Introduces non-transcript 'Knowledge Graph' as evidence, which is a factual error vs. Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered partially: doctor's statement [D-43] (misattributed), sore throat details [P-2,P-4], reduced taste [P-19,P-20,P-21] (but smell misrepresented). Missed entirely: worsening difficulty breathing [P-8-P-10], fatigue/muscle aches [P-25,P-26], doctor's screening [D-19], exposure risks [P-12,P-13], immunizations [P-14], and full constellation supporting testing. Covers ~30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims unverifiable in transcript: doctor specifically cited sore throat/dysphagia (not true), Knowledge Graph links (hallucinated, absent from transcript). Misinterprets [P-19] as smell loss. Citations [P-2, D-43, P-19] exist but twisted. Multiple hallucinations including Knowledge Graph and specific symptom attribution; dyspnea and other symptoms omitted despite relevance.",
    "relevance": "Addresses question by identifying a symptom combination (sore throat/dysphagia) and discussing taste/smell, but wrong combination (ignores dyspnea, aches), misrepresents smell, and adds irrelevant Knowledge Graph. Partially on-topic but derailed by inaccuracies and omissions."
