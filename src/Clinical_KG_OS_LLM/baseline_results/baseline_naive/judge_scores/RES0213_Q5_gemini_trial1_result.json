  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three main factors: family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors. However, it contains factual inaccuracies regarding the consultation details. It incorrectly claims the patient hasn't seen a doctor in eight years due to family worry; the transcript actually states she hasn't seen a doctor for 'anxiety attacks' specifically in eight years [P-21]. It also incorrectly attributes the mention of smoking to turn [P-8], whereas smoking is first discussed in [P-13].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several specific details present in the Gold Answer: the paternal grandfather's history (died in an accident), the specific degree (Masters of Social Work) and thesis pressure, the fact that she lives alone, and the specific smoking history (starting at 18, smoking 10/day for two years). It also misses the interaction detail about her breathing faster when nervous.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a direct connection in the patient's dialogue between smoking and the 'heart thing' at turn [P-8], which does not occur (smoking is introduced later by the doctor's general inquiry). The claim that her eight-year absence from the doctor was due to 'family worry' is an unsupported inference, as the transcript links that timeframe only to her history of anxiety.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured well to address the prompt's requirements for each factor and their interactions."
