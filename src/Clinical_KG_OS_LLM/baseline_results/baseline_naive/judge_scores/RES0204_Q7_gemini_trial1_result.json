  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect regarding the contents of the transcript. It explicitly claims that information about duration, chronological order, severity, and prior history is missing, when in fact: [P-2/P-4] states the cough lasted 4-5 days, [P-11] states the runny nose lasted 2 days, [P-7] states the severity stayed the same, and [P-24] provides a detailed comparison to prior history.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the 4-5 day duration, the clear discharge, the fact that the cough preceded the runny nose, the stability of the cough severity, and the patient's statement that they have never had a dry cough like this before.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits significant negative hallucinations. It claims the transcript does not contain specific details that are clearly present in segments [P-2], [P-4], [P-7], [P-11], and [P-24]. It fails to ground its conclusions in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer uses the correct headings to structure its response, it fails to actually answer the question by falsely claiming the information is unavailable. It does not provide the clinical narrative requested."
