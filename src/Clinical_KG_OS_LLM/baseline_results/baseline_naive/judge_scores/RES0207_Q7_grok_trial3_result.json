  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline events: seizure 'last night' (placed under evening before, consistent with transcript), forgetting medication (Keppra) as likely cause [P-9, P-23], onset of shortness of breath upon waking [P-1], temperature check of 37.4°C that morning [P-5], and decision to seek care [P-1]. Minor discrepancies include not specifying the seizure as 'later that night' after evening events, omitting the daughter's birthday celebration as the reason for forgetting medication [P-24], not mentioning the dry cough [P-2, P-4], and excluding the ~3-hour symptom onset timing before consultation [P-11]; however, no factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: evening medication forgetfulness leading to seizure (partial, misses birthday detail), seizure last night with recovery and bedtime [P-8], morning SOB onset [P-1], temperature check [P-5, P-6], decision to seek care [P-1]. Missed: daughter's birthday disruption [P-24], dry cough onset [P-2, P-4], symptoms starting ~3 hours prior to consultation [P-11], no prior history of SOB [P-3], uncertainty about seizure-respiratory link [P-8]. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: seizure [P-8], fine after and bed [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], forgot med likely cause [P-9], Keppra [P-23], SOB on waking [P-1], decision to seek care [P-1], temp 37.4°C morning [P-5]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; minor interpretive grouping of 'night' under 'evening' is plausible.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly reconstructs the requested timeline from evening before (seizure and med forget) to morning of consultation (SOB onset, temp check, decision to seek care), structured chronologically with bullet points, perfectly matching the question's focus on specified events without off-topic content."
