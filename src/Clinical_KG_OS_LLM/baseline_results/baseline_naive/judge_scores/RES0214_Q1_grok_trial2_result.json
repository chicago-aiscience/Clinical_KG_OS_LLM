  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) matching the Gold Answer's list, with accurate citations from [P-1] and [P-13]. However, while it lists the five denied symptoms correctly, it inaccurately claims they were 'explicitly denied' based on absence from [P-1] ('by not reporting... effectively denied') and cites [P-1] for denials, contradicting the Gold Answer's emphasis on explicit denials when directly asked (e.g., [P-5], [P-7], [P-8], [P-10], [P-24-26]). This introduces significant factual errors in evidence and citations compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers all four key reported symptoms from Gold. Covers the five specified denied symptoms. Misses Gold's details like symptom timelines (stuffy nose before fever, muscle aches coinciding with fever), clarifications (no joint pain [P-13], persistent sore throat, swallowing specifics [P-24-26], nausea/vomiting pairing), and accurate denial citations. Approximately 60-70% coverage of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms claims are verifiable with accurate quotes/citations ([P-1], [P-13]). Denial claims are true (verifiable in transcript at [P-5/7/8/10/24-26]) but supported by inaccurate rationale ('not in [P-1]' does not show explicit denial) and wrong citations ([P-1] only reports positives, no denials). Multiple citation errors and ungrounded explanation indicate some hallucinated support for claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported symptoms and denied symptoms as asked, with clear lists and summary addressing the exact question; no off-topic content."
