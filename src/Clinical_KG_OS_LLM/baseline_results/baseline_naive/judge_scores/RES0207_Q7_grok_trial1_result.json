  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the seizure occurring the night before (last night per [P-8]), patient feeling fine after and going to bed ([P-8]), epilepsy history ([P-8]), forgetting Keppra as likely cause ([P-9, P-23]), sudden shortness of breath upon waking in the morning ([P-1]), decision to seek care due to uncertainty ([P-1]), and morning temperature check of 37.4°C described as mild ([P-5]). No facts contradict the Gold Answer or transcript; all stated details are consistent and correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: seizure last night with recovery and bedtime ([P-8]), missed Keppra dose as cause ([P-9, P-23]), morning onset of shortness of breath ([P-1]), temperature check that morning ([P-5, P-6]), decision to seek care ([P-1]). Missed key points: daughter's birthday celebration disrupting routine and causing missed dose ([P-24]), dry cough onset ([P-2, P-4]), respiratory symptoms starting ~3 hours before consultation ([P-11]), no prior shortness of breath episodes ([P-3]), uncertainty about seizure-respiratory link ([P-8]). Covers approximately 60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: seizure details ([P-8]), missed medication ([P-9]), Keppra ([P-23]), shortness of breath ([P-1]), decision to seek care ([P-1]), temperature ([P-5]). No hallucinated facts about events; introductory mention of 'knowledge graph information' is extraneous but does not introduce ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly reconstructs a timeline from evening before (seizure and medication miss) to morning of consultation (symptom onset, temperature check, decision to seek care), using structured headings and bullets focused solely on the question's required events without tangents or off-topic content."
