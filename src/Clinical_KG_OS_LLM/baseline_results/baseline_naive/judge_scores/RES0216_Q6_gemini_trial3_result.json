  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the doctor's assessment (asthma recurrence), the physical exam (listening to lungs), the first treatment (rescue puffers), and the contingency (returning to the table). However, it suggests the patient 'takes' salbutamol based on P-25, whereas the Gold Answer correctly notes the patient hasn't refilled the rescue inhaler (P-17/P-18).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the primary components of the question. It misses a few details present in the Gold Answer: the doctor's intention to consult a supervising physician ('the doc') and the mention of potential further investigations based on physical exam findings.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript but includes a reference to a 'knowledge graph' ([KG]) which is not part of the provided source text. It also claims the patient 'takes' salbutamol, which is partially contradicted by the patient's statement about not having refilled it for years.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the assessment, physical exam, first step, and contingency plan as requested."
