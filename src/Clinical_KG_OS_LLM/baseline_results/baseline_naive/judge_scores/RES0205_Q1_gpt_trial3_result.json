  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key ongoing symptom of a 2-week cough that is now dry, with mucus earlier in the illness (consistent with P-2, P-5, P-6). It also captures the cough-associated chest discomfort, but labels it as “chest pain” without the important nuance that the patient denied independent chest pain and described soreness only after excessive coughing (P-15, P-16). It does not introduce major false claims; the main issue is slight mischaracterization/oversimplification of the chest symptom.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points covered: persistent 2-week cough; earlier mucus/productive phase now resolved; current dry cough; cough-related chest soreness.\n\nKey points missed: sore throat (first 2–3 days); runny nose (initial days); explicit timeline for mucus (first 4–5 days); current cough frequency (~3–4 times/hour); spontaneous/no triggers; stable intensity and frequency; explicit pertinent negatives (no dyspnea, no fever, no N/V, no abdominal pain); the statement that all other “flu symptoms” resolved within ~3–4 days except cough.\n\nOverall, the Generated Answer captures only a minority of the specific symptoms and descriptors requested.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript. The inclusion of acid reflux is transcript-supported (P-22) but is not part of the acute two-week illness symptoms as asked. The chest symptom is somewhat overstated as “chest pain” versus cough-related soreness; still grounded in P-15/P-16 but less precise. No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on illness symptoms (cough progression and chest discomfort; resolved ‘flu symptoms’/mucus). However, including chronic acid reflux is not relevant to the question about the two-week illness symptoms, and the answer omits many directly relevant acute symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, etc.)."

  "summary": "The answer is mostly accurate and transcript-grounded for the cough and related chest soreness but is substantially incomplete, missing several specific resolved symptoms and key descriptors (timeline, frequency, triggers, and pertinent negatives), and includes an irrelevant chronic condition."
