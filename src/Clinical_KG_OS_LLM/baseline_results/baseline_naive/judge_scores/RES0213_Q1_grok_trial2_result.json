  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the quality as 'very sharp and strong' pain on deep breath from [P-3], duration of episodes as 20 minutes from [P-6], and occurrence during sitting/studying and walking to school from [P-4], consistent with Gold. Minor discrepancies include omitting the overall 1.5-week history [P-2], initial 'uncomfortable/odd' description [P-2], intermittent nature, resolution when social/engaged [P-9, P-29], at rest confirmation [P-11], no worsening with exercise [P-10], no injury [P-5], and first occurrence [P-17]. It introduces a slight misinterpretation suggesting exertion (running) as a trigger [P-28], not supported as causal in Gold or transcript. Core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: quality (sharp/strong on deep breath), episode duration (20 min), occurrence situations (studying, walking). Missed: overall duration (1.5 weeks), initial quality (uncomfortable/odd), intermittent/recurrent nature emphasized, resolution situations (when engaged socially/at school [P-9, P-29]), occurs at rest, no worsening with exercise, no prior injury/accidents, first-time pain. Covers ~40-50% of Gold's key points, especially missing 'versus resolve' aspect central to question.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on quality [P-3], duration [P-6], studying/walking [P-4] directly verifiable in transcript. 'Does not occur all the time, often during specific activities' grounded [P-4, P-7]. Minor hallucination/misinterpretation: suggesting physical exertion (running) as trigger/factor [P-28] – patient is nervous to run due to school stress, not pain-triggered by exertion (P-10 notes no strenuous exercise due to schoolwork). No major fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses quality, duration, and occurrence situations as per question using bullet structure. Minor tangent on running nervousness, but overall focused; however, omits 'resolve' situations, making it partially incomplete on full query scope."
