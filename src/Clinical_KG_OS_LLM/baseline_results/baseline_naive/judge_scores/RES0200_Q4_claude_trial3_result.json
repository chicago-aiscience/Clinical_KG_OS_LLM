  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and the source transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key components requested in the question: (1) alternative diagnosis with rationale, (2) specific diagnostic test, and (3) turnaround time. However, the Gold Answer provides additional context about which specific symptoms overlapped (worsening cough, shortness of breath, and chills from P-29), while the Generated Answer only mentions cough and shortness of breath generically. This is a minor omission of supportive detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The citation is accurate and appropriate. There is no hallucinated content. The answer stays grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question without any irrelevant information. The formatting with bold headings makes it clear and focused. The brief reference to knowledge graph information is slightly tangential but does not detract from relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies all three required components (COVID-19 as alternative diagnosis, COVID swab as test, 24-48 hours as turnaround) with correct citations. It is highly faithful to the source and directly relevant to the question. The only minor limitation is less detailed coverage of the specific overlapping symptoms compared to the Gold Answer, which prevents a perfect completeness score."
