  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the red spots in sputum from [P-4], right-sided chest pain from [P-17], worsening with coughing and deep breaths from [P-19], subjective fever and feeling off from [P-5], and chills from [P-9], all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript; no factual errors or contradictions, though it omits some details present in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered partially: red spots in sputum (misses 'yellow custard'); right chest pain and worsening with cough/deep breath (misses constant, dull, always present even lying down); fever and chills (misses onset Monday, subjective 'felt hot' without measurement, persistence); fully misses cough history, dyspnea on exertion, sore throat, runny nose, no weight loss. Covers ~30-40% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in cited transcript segments: red spots/gunk [P-4], right pain [P-17], worse with cough/breath [P-19], fever/off [P-5], chills [P-9]; no hallucinations or inaccurate citations; descriptions like 'gunk' match patient's wording.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around the question's specified elements (sputum description, chest pain location/quality, systemic fever/chills) with bullet points matching each, no off-topic content."
