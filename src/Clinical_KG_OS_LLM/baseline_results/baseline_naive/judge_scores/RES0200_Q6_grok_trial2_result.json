  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript without errors or contradictions. It correctly lists CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG as labs (matching Gold), chest X-ray as imaging, O2 saturation and supplemental O2, continuation of bronchodilators (accurately naming Ventolin/Spiriva from transcript), steroids, and antibiotics. Minor discrepancy: categorizes COVID swab under monitoring instead of labs (as in Gold), and omits the tangential BP monitoring from [D-37] mentioned in Gold, but these do not introduce inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: CBC/electrolytes/kidney function/ABGs (labs), chest X-ray (imaging), O2 saturation/supplemental O2 (monitoring/therapeutics), bronchodilators continuation, steroids, antibiotics, COVID swab. Extra detail on bronchodilator names is accurate. Missed: explicit BP monitoring from [D-37]. Covers ~90-95% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: labs/imaging/O2/COVID/therapeutics from [D-52]; bronchodilator names from [P-11]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; citations accurate and appropriate.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to match question's request (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics including specified interventions); highly focused with no off-topic content."
