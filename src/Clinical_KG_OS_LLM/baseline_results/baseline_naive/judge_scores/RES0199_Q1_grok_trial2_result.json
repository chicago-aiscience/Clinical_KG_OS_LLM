  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes the cough and headache started four days ago per [P-1], and mentions diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, aligning with Gold. However, it inaccurately claims the nature of the cough (dry, [P-12]), frequency of diarrhea (5-6 times/day, [P-28]), number of vomiting episodes (two, [P-32]), and headache severity (7/10, [P-8]) are not described in the transcript, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript details. These are significant factual errors and contradictions on core specifics requested by the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: dry cough (nature), no sputum/blood, stable severity; resp negatives (SOB, wheezing, chest pain); diarrhea onset (2 days), liquid stools, 5-6x/day, no blood; nausea today, vomiting yesterday 2x food contents no blood; GI negatives; headache persistent bilateral location, 7/10, no radiation/stiffness, unusual; loss of smell, fatigue. Generated covers only basic symptom mentions (cough, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, headache start) without any specifics or negatives, explicitly noting key requested details as missing—covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated correctly cites [P-1] for symptom onsets but hallucinates absences: cough nature not dry ([P-12] 'mostly a dry cough'); diarrhea frequency not 5-6x ([P-28]); vomiting episodes not two ([P-32]); headache severity not 7/10 ([P-8]). No unverifiable additions beyond these false claims of absence; multiple hallucinated negations contradict transcript directly.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly around respiratory (cough) and GI (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea) symptoms, plus headache severity/frequency details as specified in the question, with no off-topic content or tangents—perfectly focused despite inaccuracies."
