  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies the findings from the initial assessment phase (D-2, D-7, D-9) as the doctor's recap summary. The actual summary occurs at [D-58]. Consequently, it misses several key findings (dry cough, lack of sputum, asthma status, and medication status) and incorrectly includes 'night sweats' which was not part of the doctor's summary. Furthermore, it completely misidentifies Jessica's goal, stating it was to conclude the appointment, whereas the transcript shows she wanted to know if she needed medicine [P-60].",
    "completeness": "The gold answer identifies seven distinct clinical points from the doctor's summary and two components of Jessica's goal. The generated answer only mentions two of the clinical points (headache, fever) and fails to capture any part of Jessica's actual clinical goal regarding medication or recovery.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer refers to a 'knowledge graph' which is not present in the provided source material. It also attributes the recap to the wrong part of the conversation and inaccurately claims the doctor recapped 'night sweats' at the end of the visit, which did not happen in turn [D-58].",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address both parts of the question (recap findings and patient goal), but because it draws from the wrong section of the transcript, the content provided is largely inaccurate relative to the specific 'summary at the end' requested."
