  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies some reported symptoms like cough being bothersome [P-1], pain with coughing [P-3], greenish gross sputum [P-9], fatigue and sleep disturbance [P-19], which align with the Gold Answer and transcript. However, it significantly errs by classifying chest pain as explicitly denied citing [P-19], contradicting the patient's report of discomfort specifically when coughing [P-3] (reported as a symptom in Gold) and misaligning with Gold's accurate distinction. It omits key details like sputum lacking blood or foul smell, and this mischaracterization introduces contradictions with Gold. Thus, significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered (partially): cough characteristics (bothersome, hurts with cough), sputum production (greenish, gross), sleep disturbance and fatigue from cough. Missed nearly all: cough duration (3 months), initial dry/intermittent/recurrent nature, onset at pole dancing, productive only past 3 days, no blood in sputum, no foul smell noticed, nightly waking specifically last month, chest discomfort only with cough (distinctly reported), subjective fevers/hot at night, exercise impairment; denials of night sweats, weight loss/loose clothes, hemoptysis, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, body pain/tenderness, sick contacts. Covers approximately 20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about cough, sputum, fatigue, and sleep are verifiable in cited transcript sections [P-1, P-3, P-9, P-19]. However, chest pain denial cited to [P-19] is inaccurate as that denies general body pain/tenderness, not the earlier-asked chest pain [P-3]; mentions non-existent 'knowledge graph information' (hallucination, no such in source); minor misattribution and fabrication lower grounding.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around reported respiratory/associated symptoms, cough/sputum characteristics, and denied symptoms, with no off-topic content, perfectly matching the question's focus."
