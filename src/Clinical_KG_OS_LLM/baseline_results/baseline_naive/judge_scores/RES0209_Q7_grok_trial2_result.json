  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the diagnosis at age eight (P-2), consistent with Gold. Current exacerbation symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) over the past two weeks align with Gold (P-1, P-15, D-14). Bronchodilator evolution from infrequent baseline to increased current use is correct in principle (P-8, P-1), with no contradictions, though specifics like exact frequencies (once every two weeks to 5-6 times/week) are omitted. Patient age (now 10) not mentioned but not erroneous. References to KG do not contradict facts. Overall, minor discrepancies in detail, core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: diagnosis at 8/now 10; baseline bronchodilator once/2 weeks, triggers (exercise, cold, seasonal); exacerbation (2 weeks: nonstop dry cough, lots wheezing, SOB, chest tightness, nighttime every other day, wheezing > usage, no precipitant); usage change specific. Generated covers: diagnosis at 8; current symptoms (cough, SOB, wheezing); vague usage (infrequent to 'a lot'). Missed: current age, baseline/current specific frequencies, all triggers, chest tightness, nighttime symptoms, wheezing frequency vs usage, no infection. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom claims (cough P-1/D-14, SOB P-1, wheezing P-15) verifiable with accurate citations. Usage evolution grounded in transcript (P-1, implied P-8). However, repeated [KG] references and 'knowledge graph provided' not present in source transcript, introducing unverifiable/hallucinated elements (e.g., 'standard treatment [KG]'). Other claims plausible and mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Answer structured temporally (initial diagnosis, current symptoms, treatment evolution), directly addressing question's focus on asthma symptoms and bronchodilator usage progression from diagnosis through baseline to exacerbation. No off-topic content, perfectly focused despite detail gaps."
