  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core epidemiological factors from the Gold Answer (husband's prior illness suggesting household transmission, limited outside contacts supporting this, and lack of flu shot making influenza viable). It correctly notes prioritization of COVID-19 testing due to household spread [D-53] and mentions influenza as possible [D-54]. Minor discrepancies include introducing a non-existent 'knowledge graph' to link symptoms to COVID and framing symptoms as primary for prioritization, whereas Gold emphasizes epi factors; however, core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key Gold points: husband's week-long illness and doctor's response [D-53]; shared household/limited contact (works from home, isolation advice); no flu shot raising influenza possibility while prioritizing COVID. Less detail on specific exposures like hiking or no other sick contacts, but 80-99% coverage of epi factors' role in differential.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about husband's illness, household isolation [D-53, D-54], COVID swab, and flu shot [D-53] are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. Hallucination of 'knowledge graph' indicating symptoms diagnose COVID (not in transcript); minor overstatements like 'strongest indicator' or 'treatment protocol' plausible but not verbatim. Mostly grounded with one notable fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how specified epi risk factors (husband's illness, household/limited contact, no flu shot) shape prioritization of COVID-19 over influenza in differential, structuring response around them with transcript ties; minor symptom tangent but focused on question."
