{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly claims no information on prior medication tried, directly contradicting Gold Answer and transcript [P-10] where patient reports trying decongestants; assessment of effectiveness is wrongly attributed to [P-1] and misstates it as 'not improving' instead of 'worked a little bit' per [P-10]; recommendation partially correct on Tylenol Cold but omits hydration and viral context, leading to significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) tried decongestants [P-10]; (2) assessment 'worked a little bit' with reasoning about runny nose [P-10]; (3) hydrated + Tylenol Cold + few weeks viral [D-39]. Generated covers only Tylenol Cold (~10-20% coverage), misses prior trial entirely and full recommendation details.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims 'transcript does not contain any information' on medication tried, but [P-10] explicitly states 'I've tried like decongestants'; assessment not verifiable in cited [P-1], actual source [P-10] contradicted; Tylenol citation [D-39] accurate, but overall multiple hallucinations of absence/misattribution.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the three-part question directly (medication tried, assessment, recommendation) with no off-topic content."
