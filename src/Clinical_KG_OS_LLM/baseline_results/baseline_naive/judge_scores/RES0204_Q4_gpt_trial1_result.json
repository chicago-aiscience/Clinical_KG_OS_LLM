  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states the ruled-out condition was asthma and that the mother cited specific negatives: no shortness of breath, no wheezing, including during physical activity, and that he had been “worked up for that.” The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma, but then incorrectly claims the transcript does not contain the mother’s specific ruling-out findings. This directly contradicts P-28, which explicitly includes those findings. It also introduces “Knowledge Graph” evidence not part of the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements: (1) asthma considered due to grandparents’ history, (2) prior negative workup (“been worked up for that”), (3) no shortness of breath, (4) no wheezing, (5) absence even with physical activity (no exercise-induced symptoms), (6) mother’s conclusion “he doesn’t have that,” and optionally (7) patient otherwise healthy/no prior similar dry cough. Generated Answer includes only (1) partially; it misses (2)-(6) and incorrectly denies their presence. Thus it covers well under half of the required content.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not well grounded in the provided transcript: it references a “Knowledge Graph” that is not in the source transcript and asserts the mother’s activity-related symptom negatives are not present, despite being explicitly stated in P-28. This is a significant faithfulness failure (contradiction and extraneous source).",
    "relevance": "It attempts to answer the question by naming asthma, but fails to provide the requested clinical findings and includes minor irrelevant discussion (dry cough/runny nose/X-ray/COVID swab) rather than the key ruling-out features. Still partially on-topic."
