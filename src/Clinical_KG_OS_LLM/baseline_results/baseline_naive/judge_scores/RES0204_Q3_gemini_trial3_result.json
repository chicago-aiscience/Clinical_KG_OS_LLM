  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the present symptoms (dry cough, runny nose) and the rationale for the tests (CXR for lung visualization, COVID swab for protocol). However, it incorrectly characterizes the patient's condition as 'Respiratory Distress'. Per the transcript, the patient is healthy, playing video games, and explicitly lacks shortness of breath or wheezing. It also fails to incorporate the 'absent findings' (pertinent negatives like lack of fever, chills, etc.) which were a central part of the prompt's requirements.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a significant portion of the Gold Answer. Specifically, it ignores the extensive list of pertinent negatives (no fever, chills, sore throat, loss of taste/smell, chest pain, muscle aches, etc.) that the prompt and Gold Answer emphasize. While it covers the 'presenting' symptoms and the resulting orders, it fails to explain how the *combination* with absent findings informed the decision.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains hallucinations. It references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context. It also labels the symptoms as 'Respiratory Distress', a term not found in the transcript and actually contradicted by the patient's described state and the mother's report in [P-28].",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant as it addresses the diagnostic workup. However, it fails to address the specific constraint of the question regarding how 'absent findings' contributed to the clinical reasoning, focusing only on the present symptoms."
