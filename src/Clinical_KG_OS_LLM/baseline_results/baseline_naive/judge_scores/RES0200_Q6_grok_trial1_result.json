  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major elements of the management plan from [D-52], including labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG), chest X-ray, O2 saturation monitoring with supplemental O2 if needed, continuation of bronchodilators (correctly naming Ventolin and Spiriva from transcript), steroids, and antibiotics. Minor discrepancies: places COVID swab under monitoring instead of labs (as in Gold), and omits the additional note on blood pressure monitoring from [D-37] included in Gold Answer. Core facts remain fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: all labs except COVID swab categorization (still mentioned), chest X-ray (100%), O2 sat and supp O2 (100%), bronchodilators continuation with specifics (100%+), steroids (100%), antibiotics (100%). Missed: explicit mention of blood pressure monitoring from [D-37]. Covers ~90-95% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: labs, CXR, O2, COVID swab, bronchodilators (names from [P-11], continuation [D-52]), steroids, antibiotics all from [D-52]. Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; minor spelling 'Ventilin' matches transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response matching question's requested categories (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics) and lists all specified interventions (steroids, antibiotics, supp O2, bronchodilators continuation). No off-topic content."
