  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the clinician’s assessment that symptoms were consistent with common COVID-19 symptoms and correctly reports the COVID test via swab and the 1–2 day result timeline, plus self-isolation guidance until results (and possibly longer if symptoms persist). However, it contains a key factual error: it states the transcript does not explicitly mention consulting a supervising physician, but the transcript explicitly says, “we’ll go over this with the doctor that I’m working with today” [D-40]. This directly contradicts the source and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Included: (1) overall COVID-suspected assessment; (2) COVID test ordered; (3) swab collection method; (4) results in 1–2 days; (5) self-isolation until results and potentially longer if symptoms persist.\nMissed: mention that the patient otherwise seemed generally well; mention of possible additional tests (“might be a couple other tests we want to do”); mention that they may return with more questions after the consult; explicit plan to review with supervising doctor/working physician; closing reassurance (“taken care of shortly”). Overall coverage is partial (~60–75%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in [D-39]. The main faithfulness issue is the incorrect claim that there was no explicit plan to consult a supervising physician, which is contradicted by [D-40]. Aside from that, no major hallucinated additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested assessment/plan elements (tests, collection method, self-care, timeline). It is relevant, with no major tangents, but it omits some requested components (additional tests/follow-up and supervising-physician consult)."
