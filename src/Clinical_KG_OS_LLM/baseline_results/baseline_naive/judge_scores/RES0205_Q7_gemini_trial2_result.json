  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains factual inaccuracies regarding the timeline. It states mucus production and the transition to a dry cough occurred after 2-3 days, whereas the Gold Answer and Transcript [P-6] specify this happened after 4-5 days. It also implies the cough is intense/frequent now, but fails to note that the patient stated the intensity and frequency remained stable throughout the two weeks [P-7, P-8].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points requested in the prompt. It fails to describe what the mucus looked like ('whitish clear'), does not mention specific flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose), omits the frequency of the cough (3-4 times per hour), and misses the detail that intensity/frequency remained unchanged over time.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript [P-6] by stating mucus lasted 2-3 days when the patient explicitly said 4-5 days. It also omits the specific descriptors provided in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally relevant to the question of timeline but fails to address specific sub-questions, such as the appearance of the mucus and the specific nature of the change (or lack thereof) in intensity and frequency over time."
