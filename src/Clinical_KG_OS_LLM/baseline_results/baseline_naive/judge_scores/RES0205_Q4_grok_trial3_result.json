  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and the 'covid-19 test' as the specific test used, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-35]. However, it inaccurately states that the timing of the test relative to symptom onset is not explicitly specified in the transcript [P-35], contradicting both the Gold Answer and the patient's clear statement in [P-36] that the test was done 'when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.' Additionally, workplace concerns are partially correct (coworkers scared [P-35]) but miss key details like hospital clerk role [P-34], PPE use [P-17], staying home, and desire to return without coughing [P-36]. Some factual errors present.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 ruled out (covered); (2) 'covid test' negative [P-35] (covered); (3) test at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior [P-36] (missed); (4) workplace concerns including hospital job [P-34], PPE [P-17], coworkers scared [P-35], staying home post-test, eagerness to return without coughing, med desire [P-35/P-36] (only partially covered: coworkers scared). Covers approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Condition and test claims verifiable in [P-35]; coworkers scared verifiable [P-35]; cough duration verifiable [P-2]. However, claim that test timing 'does not explicitly specify' is incorrect as [P-36] directly states it; 'Knowledge Graph' reference is entirely hallucinated/not in transcript; no other major fabrications but includes unverifiable addition and misinterpretation.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured with bullet points directly addressing each part of the question (condition, test, timing, concerns), with content focused on the query despite inaccuracies and minor extraneous 'Knowledge Graph' tangent; no significant off-topic material."
