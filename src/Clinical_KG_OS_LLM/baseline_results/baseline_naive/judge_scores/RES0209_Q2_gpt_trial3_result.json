  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the patient uses a bronchodilator for asthma. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the administration method—this is explicitly stated as a “puffer” (D-7/P-7). It also incorrectly claims the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication; the clinician clearly asked about a medication taken “every day no matter what” (D-5), which the patient said they do not have (P-5). These are major contradictions to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: bronchodilator use. Key points missed/incorrect: as-needed use framing (D-4/P-4), administration via puffer/inhaler (D-7/P-7), explicit denial of any other meds (D-6/P-6; D-30/P-30), and the doctor’s question about a daily controller/maintenance med and the patient lacking it (D-5/P-5). Overall coverage is well under 50% of required details.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript and directly contradict it: claiming administration is unspecified despite D-7/P-7, and claiming no daily-controller question despite D-5/P-5. The mention of a “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript. While it quotes P-1 accurately, multiple core claims are unfaithful.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to answer the question (current medication, administration, missing daily controller) and stays mostly on-topic. However, it includes a minor irrelevant reference to a “knowledge graph.”"
