  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer explicitly cites D-43 for the clinician's suggestion of 'a little change to your medications' as part of the plan, noting its context with the patient's rescue-only regimen and increased use; Generated Answer incorrectly states that 'the specific instruction to change the medication regimen is not explicitly detailed,' misrepresenting the transcript and introducing a factual discrepancy on a core element of the plan, though COVID swab and consultation are accurately captured with correct citations.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) multi-step plan structure; (2) COVID swab (D-29) despite negative screening; (3) explicit med change suggestion (D-43) with context of rescue-only/increased use and sports goal (D-42); (4) consultation details (D-43/D-29) indicating trainee status, presenting case, returning together. Generated covers COVID swab, consultation (partially), and med topic but misses explicit suggestion quote/context, trainee aspect, return together, sports goal, and plan structure depth—covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "COVID swab verifiable [D-29]; consultation verifiable [D-29]; med regimen claim of 'not explicitly detailed' contradicts transcript [D-43: 'maybe all you need is a little change to your medications'], and inference of justification from symptoms [P-1] is plausible but secondary; calls clinician 'physician' unsupported (suggests trainee); minor hallucination in denying explicitness but mostly grounded otherwise.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the three specified elements (diagnostic test, med regimen suggestion, consultation next steps) with bullet points mirroring the question's focus, containing no off-topic content."
