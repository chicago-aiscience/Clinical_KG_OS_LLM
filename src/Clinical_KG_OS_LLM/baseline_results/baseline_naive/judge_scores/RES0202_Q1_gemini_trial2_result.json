  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies most reported symptoms (cough, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of taste). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the second part of the question. It explicitly states that the doctor did not ask about and the mother did not deny wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, and GI complaints. In reality, the transcript shows the doctor specifically asking about wheezing [D-7], chest pain [D-13], sore throat [D-14], chills [D-19], and GI issues like diarrhea/nausea [D-22, D-23], all of which were denied.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the majority of the reported symptoms (though it misses the runny nose mentioned in [P-16]). However, it fails to provide the list of denied symptoms requested by the prompt, instead providing an incorrect negative response stating they were not discussed.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination/error by claiming that the symptoms listed in the prompt were not asked about or denied. This directly contradicts the transcript where these specific items were discussed. It also incorrectly cites [D-44] as the source of the doctor's symptom inquiry, when [D-44] is actually a concluding instruction about COVID-19 protocols.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address both parts of the question but fails to provide a relevant or accurate response to the second half, which was the primary focus of the specific symptoms listed in the prompt."
