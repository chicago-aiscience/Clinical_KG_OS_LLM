  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the assessment (COVID-19 suspicion), the diagnostic test (swab), and the isolation instructions. However, it explicitly states that the transcript does not mention a plan to consult a supervising physician, which is factually incorrect. In segment [D-40], the clinician specifically says, 'we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers several key points: assessment, diagnostic test, method of collection, timeline, and isolation instructions. However, it misses two specific requirements from the prompt: the mention of 'additional tests or follow-up' (found in [D-40]) and the plan to consult a supervising physician (found in [D-40]).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript for the sections it includes (specifically [D-39]). However, it contains a 'hallucination of absence' by claiming the transcript does not mention a supervising physician, which contradicts the source text in [D-40].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and follows the structure requested by the prompt, addressing each category explicitly."
