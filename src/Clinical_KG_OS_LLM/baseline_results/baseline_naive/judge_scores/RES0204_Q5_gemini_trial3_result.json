  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error. It explicitly claims that the transcript 'does not explicitly state that the patient is absent of shortness of breath or wheezing,' whereas turn [P-28] of the transcript states: 'he doesn't get short of breath or wheezing or anything like that with even with physical activity.' This contradicts the Gold Answer and the source text.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention that the patient had a prior 'work up' for asthma with negative results. 2) It fails to provide the correct evidence for the absence of wheezing/shortness of breath as requested by the prompt. 3) It misses the patient's comparison to prior healthy history [P-24].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present in [P-28]. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source text, though it uses it to make a plausible clinical connection.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address both parts of the question, it fails the second part significantly by stating the requested evidence (absence of wheezing/shortness of breath) is not in the text, when the prompt itself noted these symptoms and the transcript confirmed their absence."
