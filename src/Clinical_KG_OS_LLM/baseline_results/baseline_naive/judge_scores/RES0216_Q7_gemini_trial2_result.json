{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the transcript does not explicitly state the progression of symptoms (better/worse/same), whereas the patient explicitly states 'I think it's staying the same' [P-2] and that it has been 'pretty steady' [P-3].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention that the tightness is exacerbated by 'getting up out of the chair' or taking a 'big breath' [P-9]; it fails to specify that the walking routine changed from two walks per day to one [P-22]; and it misses the fact that the symptoms are 'staying the same'.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits a hallucination of absence by claiming the transcript lacks information regarding symptom evolution that is clearly present in [P-2] and [P-3]. The rest of the information provided is grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer follows the structure of the question and attempts to address each component, but the quality of the information provided is poor due to the errors and omissions noted above."
