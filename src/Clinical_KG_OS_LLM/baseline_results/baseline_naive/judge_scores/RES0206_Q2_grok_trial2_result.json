  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details COPD inhalers (maintenance daily, rescue ~every 2 weeks), no oxygen, no names; HTN diagnosis, no meds due to choosing lifestyle changes first (weight loss, walking), BP OK, doctor support, plus lifestyle (quit smoking, rare alcohol), well-managed baseline, no allergies. Generated correctly identifies two inhalers and frequencies but wrongly cites [P-1] for rescue frequency (actual [P-26]); adds past referral as strategy (minor); for HTN correctly notes no meds but erroneously claims no specific reason in transcript, contradicting Gold's extraction from [P-23,P-24]; misses many details like no O2, lifestyle factors. Significant contradictions on HTN reason and citation error warrant score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: two inhalers, daily maintenance [P-26], rescue every 2 weeks [P-26]. Missed: no home oxygen [P-1], no med names, HTN reason (lifestyle trial [P-23,P-24]), BP OK [P-23], doctor support [D-25], quit smoking [P-40], rare alcohol [P-39], well-managed [P-28], exacerbations when sick [P-27], no allergies [P-29,30]. Covers ~30-40% of points (mainly inhalers), so score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: puffers [P-1,P-26], inhaler details [P-26], HTN [P-22], no meds implied [P-23], referral [P-8]. Issues: cites [P-1] inaccurately for rescue frequency (not there); claims 'transcript does not provide specific reason' for no HTN meds, but [P-23] explicitly states lifestyle choice—this is a hallucinated absence/misinterpretation. Minor hallucination and citation errors, plausible but not fully verifiable, score 3.",
    "relevance": "Generated uses clear headings for COPD (meds, strategies, frequencies) and HTN (status, meds, reason), directly mirroring question components with no off-topic content or tangents; perfectly focused despite gaps, score 5."
