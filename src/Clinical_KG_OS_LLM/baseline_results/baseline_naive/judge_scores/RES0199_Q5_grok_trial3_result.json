  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer accurately details the doctor's systematic exploration of living situation (D-45/P-45, D-46/P-46), sick contacts (D-47/P-47), workplace (D-48/P-48, D-50/P-50), and travel (D-49/P-49), with citations. The Generated Answer falsely claims the doctor 'did not systematically explore' these, contradicting both Gold and transcript evidence (e.g., explicit questions in D-45 to D-50). This is a complete factual reversal, warranting score 1.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: living situation details and environmental triggers; sick contacts including work lunchroom; workplace (car dealership, sick colleagues); travel; substance use screening; no clear source. Generated covers 0% of these, instead asserting no exploration occurred and shifting to COVID focus (D-52), missing all points. Score 1.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absence of exposure questions despite clear transcript evidence (D-45: live where?; D-46: carpets/dust/etc.; D-47: contact sick?; D-48: work where?; D-49: travel?; D-50: work sick?). Misquotes D-52 as evidence of no inquiry, but those questions precede it. Largely fabricated denial of events. Score 1.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly responds to the question by stating no systematic exploration of the specified areas (living, workplace, travel, sick contacts), then justifies with COVID focus. No off-topic content; perfectly mirrors question structure despite factual error. Score 5."
