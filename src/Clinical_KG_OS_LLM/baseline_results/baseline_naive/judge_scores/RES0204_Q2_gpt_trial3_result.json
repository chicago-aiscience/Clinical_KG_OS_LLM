  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies both proposed diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) and accurately states the rationale for the COVID swab as routine testing for anyone presenting with similar symptoms, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-37, D-39]. No factual contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) chest X-ray proposed to better assess what’s going on [D-37]; (2) COVID nasal swab proposed [D-39]; (3) rationale for swab is protocol—testing anyone with these symptoms lately [D-39].\nMinor items not included: the more explicit explanation that an X-ray is “like taking a picture of your body on the inside” [D-39], the note about discomfort/reassurance, and the plan to arrange tests and return with supervising doctor. These omissions are minor relative to the question focus.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (chest X-ray suggestion [D-37]; COVID swab and rationale [D-39]; swab involves inserting into the nose [D-39]). No hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what was asked: proposed diagnostic procedures and the specific stated rationale for ordering the COVID swab. No irrelevant tangents."
