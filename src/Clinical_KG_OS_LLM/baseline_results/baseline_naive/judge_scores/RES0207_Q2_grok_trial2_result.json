  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication for epilepsy, matching the Gold Answer [P-23, P-8]. It also notes the patient forgot the dose [P-9], consistent with Gold. However, it lacks the specific circumstance (daughter's birthday celebration and routine disruption [P-24]) emphasized in Gold, and introduces an unverifiable 'knowledge graph' not in Gold or transcript, representing a minor discrepancy.",
    "completeness": "Covered: Keppra for epilepsy [P-23]; forgot medication [P-9]. Missed: specific circumstance of daughter's birthday celebration, usual dinner routine change, no later dinner leading to forgetfulness [P-24]; doctor's acknowledgment [D-25]; isolated lapse confirmation [D-24]; seizure link detail [P-9 full context]. Covers approximately 25-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Keppra [P-23], epilepsy context [P-8, P-22], and forgetting [P-9] are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. The 'knowledge graph' reference is not in transcript, introducing a hallucinated detail, but core clinical facts are grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around medication and missed dose circumstance, addressing the question's two parts, though incompletely on specifics; minor irrelevant mention of knowledge graph."
