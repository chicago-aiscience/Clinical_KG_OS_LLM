  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two-day onset and the simultaneous start of symptoms. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not provide information about symptom progression (worsening/fluctuating) or prior history. In the transcript, the patient explicitly states the symptoms have been 'pretty consistent' (P-5, P-8) and that they have never had 'nothing like this' before (P-3).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two major components of the Gold Answer: the fact that symptoms remained consistent/did not worsen and the explicit confirmation that the patient had no prior history of these symptoms. It only successfully covers the timing of onset.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly by claiming that information is missing when it is clearly present in the source text. It 'hallucinates' an absence of data regarding progression and history, directly contradicting the dialogue in [D-3/P-3], [D-5/P-5], and [D-8/P-8].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant as it attempts to answer every specific part of the user's prompt, even though its conclusions about the content of the transcript are factually wrong."
