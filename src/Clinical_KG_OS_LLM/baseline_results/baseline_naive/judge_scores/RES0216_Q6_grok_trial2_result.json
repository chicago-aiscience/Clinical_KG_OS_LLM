  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core assessment (asthma recurrence at top of differential [D-35]), planned lung auscultation, recommendation for rescue puffers as first-step trial during walks [D-35], and contingency to reassess if no improvement [D-35]. Minor discrepancies include not noting that the patient lacks rescue inhalers (contrasting Gold's reference to P-17/P-18), specifying 'salbutamol' as the rescue (patient's salbutamol [P-25] is the daily inhaler), and omitting 'pending examination/findings' qualifier. Core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: assessment (asthma top differential), physical exam component (listen to lungs), first-step treatment (rescue puffers trial on walks), contingency (back to table if no help). Missed or partial: 'quick physical exam' beyond lungs, further investigations depending on findings, explicit note that patient lacks rescue inhalers, stepwise 'one thing at a time' [D-36], and consulting supervising doctor [D-35/D-37]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: assessment, exam, treatment, contingency directly from [D-35]; patient takes salbutamol verifiable [P-25]. Hallucinations: '[KG]' and 'knowledge graph indication that the diagnosis of asthma recurring requires this procedure' not in transcript. Minor unverifiable addition, no multiple fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question: assessment, physical exam components, first-step treatment, contingency approach. No off-topic content beyond minor hallucinated KG reference."
