  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the dry cough (duration noted as week or two weeks, nonstop daytime from P-1, P-13, P-14), short of breath (P-1), and wheezing a lot (P-15). However, it incorrectly states that chest sensations/tightness were not explicitly reported, contradicting Gold's citation of P-20 where patient confirms 'Yes' to chest tightness. It also misses and denies any nighttime symptom information, contradicting Gold's details from P-18 (nighttime symptoms every other day or so, less than daytime). Additionally, it omits details like hard time breathing (P-19) and wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use (P-17). References to [KG] introduce external info not in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) dry cough ~2 weeks, nonstop day (covered fully); 2) breathing difficulty (SOB P-1, hard time breathing P-19, severe wheezing P-16) - partial (only SOB); 3) wheezing a lot, more freq than reliever (P-15,17) - partial (only 'a lot'); 4) chest tightness (P-20) - not covered, explicitly denied; 5) day vs night freq (day more prominent/near-constant P-1, night less/every other day P-18) - partial (only day, misses night). Covers ~30-40% fully/accurately (mainly cough/daytime), so low coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: cough details verifiable (P-1,13,14); SOB (P-1); wheezing (P-15). However, hallucinated absence of chest tightness (verifiable P-20 'Yes'); hallucinated absence of nighttime symptoms (P-18 explicitly states they occur less frequently); adds unverifiable [KG] knowledge graph and 'standard treatment' not in transcript. Multiple misses of transcript facts and external additions indicate poor grounding.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around specific symptoms (cough character, breathing difficulties, wheezing, chest sensations) and day/night frequency, with bullet points matching query elements; no off-topic content despite errors."
