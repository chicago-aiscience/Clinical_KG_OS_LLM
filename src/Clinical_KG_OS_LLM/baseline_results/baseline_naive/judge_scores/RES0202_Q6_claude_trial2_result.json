  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer: COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation including from sister, false negative possibility, alternative viral illness if negative, and specific warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms/seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells). The wording is slightly different but all facts are consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components: diagnostic test and timing, isolation period and scope, false negative possibility, alternative diagnosis, and warning signs with specific examples. However, it omits the minor detail from D-45 about asthma being considered if fever were absent, and doesn't explicitly mention 'watchful waiting with no medications prescribed.' These are supplementary contextual points rather than core elements of the management plan.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The COVID swab and timing [D-44], 14-day isolation including sister [D-44], false negatives and alternative viral illness [D-44], and specific warning signs [D-44] are all accurately cited. No hallucinated information is present. The answer appropriately focuses on D-44 where the assessment and plan were delivered.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses all aspects of the multi-part question: diagnostic test ordered, turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negative possibility, and warning signs with examples. The response is well-organized and focused entirely on answering the question without tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent response that accurately captures the doctor's complete assessment and management plan. All factual information is correct and consistent with the Gold Answer, including the COVID swab (24-48 hours), 14-day isolation, false negative acknowledgment, alternative viral illness consideration, and specific warning signs. The answer is highly faithful to the transcript with proper citations and directly addresses all components of the question. The only minor gap is the omission of supplementary contextual details about asthma consideration and the watchful waiting approach, which slightly affects completeness but does not detract from the core answer quality."
