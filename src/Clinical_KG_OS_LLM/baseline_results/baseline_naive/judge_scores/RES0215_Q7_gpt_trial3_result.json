  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states onset at 4–5 days, initial symptoms of wheeze/dyspnea, exertional trigger (playing tag), and that a cough appeared later. However, it contains notable inaccuracies: it attributes “difficulty taking deep breaths” to [P-1] (that detail is in [P-2]), it mischaracterizes the fluctuating pattern by referencing past “infections come and go” (not part of the wheeze episode pattern) and by implying absence of cyanosis proves fluctuation (not supported). It also incorrectly states the nocturnal episode occurred “during the visit,” whereas the transcript describes a single prior night episode that resolved spontaneously and caused trouble falling asleep.",
    "completeness": "Captures several key points (4–5 day onset, exertional trigger, later emergence of cough, and that there was a night-time issue with trouble falling asleep). It misses/does not clearly state major Gold Answer details: the specific episodic cycle of symptoms recurring with activity and resolving with rest; that symptoms did not fully go away over the 4–5 days; cough was non-productive (no phlegm); and other pertinent negatives (no fever, looks well between episodes).",
    "faithfulness": "Some statements are not grounded or are distorted relative to the transcript: linking historical viral infections to the current fluctuating wheeze course, interpreting “slightly” and lack of cyanosis as evidence of fluctuation, and the incorrect timing of the nocturnal episode (“during the visit”). Most other core claims (onset timeframe, exertional trigger, cough, trouble falling asleep one night) are supported.",
    "relevance": "Largely addresses the asked symptom timeline (trigger, fluctuation, cough emergence, nocturnal episode). Minor irrelevant/inappropriate additions include discussion of prior infections and speculative interpretation of cyanosis/‘slightly’ to support fluctuation."
