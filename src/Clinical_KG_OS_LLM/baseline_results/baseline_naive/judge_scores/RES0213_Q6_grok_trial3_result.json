  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript ends at [P-28] with no doctor's concluding remarks, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript which includes [D-33] explicitly stating the plan to pass information to another doctor; while it partially covers some symptoms and history, it misses or inaccurately represents key details like full symptom characteristics (e.g., 1.5 weeks duration, rest/alone triggers, distraction relief), many pertinent negatives, precise smoking history, and anxiety details, plus hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph'; significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers plan precisely and lists 5 detailed categories of key info; Generated misses the entire plan (major omission), covers partially symptoms (sharp pain, deep breath, 20 min, some triggers), failed OTC, partial family/smoking/PMH/psychosocial/meds, but misses ~70% including full symptoms (1.5wks, rest/distraction/exercise, no worsens), all pertinent negatives (trauma/fevers/asthma/SOB/palps/family sudden death), full anxiety/smoking details, thesis/living alone; covers ~30-40%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims transcript ends at [P-28] with no concluding doctor dialogue is false (hallucinated, as [D-33] exists); most cited claims from [P-#] are verifiable but incomplete/misstated (e.g., PMH as 'this issue' vs anxiety); adds unverifiable 'Knowledge Graph' hallucination; multiple issues.",
    "relevance": "Addresses only second part of question (key info) partially with some structure but ignores first part (plan/concluding remarks) by wrongly denying its existence; minor off-topic Knowledge Graph note; partially relevant."
