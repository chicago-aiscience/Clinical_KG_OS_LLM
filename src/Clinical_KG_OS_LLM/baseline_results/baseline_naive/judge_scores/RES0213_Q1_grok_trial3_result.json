  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the quality as 'very sharp' and 'strong' pain worsening on deep breath [P-3], matching Gold. Duration of episodes at 20 minutes [P-6] is correct. Situations of occurrence (studying, walking to school [P-4]) align, but it omits resolution contexts (e.g., unnoticed when with others [P-9, P-29]), at-rest occurrence, non-worsening with exercise [P-10], onset duration, initial 'uncomfortable/odd' description, no injury, and first-time nature from Gold. The inference that nervousness about running 'suggests physical exertion may be a trigger' [P-28] misinterprets the transcript, as P-10 explicitly denies worsening with exercise/walking, introducing a factual error. Overall, core facts correct but some errors and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1.5-week onset [P-2]; quality (uncomfortable/odd to sharp/strong on deep breath [P-2,P-3]); 20-min intermittent episodes [P-6,P-7]; occurs alone (walking/studying [P-4,P-29]); resolves/unnoticed with people/activities [P-9,P-29]; at rest [D-11,P-11]; not worse with exercise [P-10]; no injury [P-5]; first time [P-17]. Generated covers: quality (partial, sharp/strong/deep breath); episode duration (20 min); occurrence (studying/walking). Misses: onset, full quality nuance, intermittency detail, all resolution contexts (key to question), at rest, exercise non-worsening, injury/first-time. Covers ~50-60% of key points, especially weak on 'versus resolve'.",
    "faithfulness": "All direct claims grounded: quality/duration [P-3,P-6]; occurrences [P-4]. Citations accurate. However, 'nervous about running lately, suggesting ... physical exertion may be a trigger or factor [P-28]' is an ungrounded interpretation/hallucination—P-28 links nervousness to school stress, not pain, and contradicted by P-10 (no worsening with walking/exercise). No other fabrications; mostly verifiable but one interpretive hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around quality, duration, and situations (triggers/occurrences), mirroring question. Addresses occur contexts well but omits resolve (question specifies 'versus resolve'), and running tangent is minor off-topic inference. No major irrelevance; highly focused on pain characteristics."
