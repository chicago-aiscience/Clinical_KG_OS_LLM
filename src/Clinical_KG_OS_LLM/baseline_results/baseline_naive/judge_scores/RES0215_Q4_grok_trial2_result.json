  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies purposes for fever (infection), runny nose (URI/cold), and phlegm (bacterial bronchitis/infection), aligning somewhat with Gold's infectious screenings. However, it significantly errs by claiming the transcript lacks questions on sick contacts [D-10], recent travel [D-11], and rashes [D-13], directly contradicting Gold which details these for contagious, exposure, and systemic conditions. It also misattributes narrowing solely to asthma/allergies with extras like knowledge graph (absent), while Gold emphasizes reactive airway disease via negatives. Significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: fever->pneumonia/bronchitis; runny nose->URI/viral wheeze; sick contacts->contagious; travel->exposure infections; rashes->systemic/allergic/viral; phlegm->productive infection; plus pain->pleuritic/musculoskeletal; looks fine [P-9]; past virals no abx [P-16]; narrowing to reactive. Generated covers fever, runny nose, phlegm (~3/6 main points, partial purposes); misses sick contacts, travel, rashes, pain entirely; ignores looks fine/past virals specifically for narrowing. Adds unrelated allergies/exertion (~30-40% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Verifiable: fever [D-7/P-7], runny [D-8/P-8], phlegm [D-31/P-31], seasonal allergies [P-35/36], viral history [P-15], exertional [P-2/3]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph' links/references (absent); false claim transcript lacks sick contacts/travel/rashes (present at [D-10/11/13]); infers Reactine confirmation/asthma hallmark beyond transcript. Multiple hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses screening via fever/runny/phlegm for infections vs allergy/asthma, with responses narrowing differential, per question. However, ignores 3/6 specified symptoms (sick/travel/rashes), adds off-topic details (knowledge graph, full allergy/exertion/viral history analysis, conclusion to asthma), diluting focus."
