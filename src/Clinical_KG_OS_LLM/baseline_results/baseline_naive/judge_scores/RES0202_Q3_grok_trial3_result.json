  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies a triad of dry cough worsening over 3 days (with citations), fever >100°F on Friday (citations), possible loss of taste (P-17), explicit [D-44] alignment with COVID, and crucially [D-45] use of fever to conclude infection (vs. asthma without fever). Generated correctly identifies the three symptoms but inaccurately calls parent 'father' (it's mother), cites wrong reference [P-15] for cough (P-15 is about appetite/swallowing), mentions non-existent 'medical knowledge graph', quotes [D-44] as 'allowed' (transcript matches), partially covers reasoning but omits [D-45] fever distinction for infection; core facts mostly correct but significant discrepancies in details and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: triad details/citations, [D-44] alignment, [D-45] fever→infection (vs asthma), acute/systemic combo prioritizing COVID. Generated covers basic triad (less detail, one wrong cite), [D-44], basic conclusion on infection/COVID; misses dry quality, 3-day timeline detail, [D-45]/asthma contrast, systemic aspects (fatigue/appetite explicitly), full prioritization reasoning. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly grounded: symptoms/citations from transcript (except [P-15] wrong for cough, verifiable cough worsening in [P-1,P-12]); [D-44] quote accurate to transcript; but hallucinations include 'father' (mother), 'medical knowledge graph provided' (absent), overstates doctor 'concluded ... likely involves COVID-19' (doctor said 'aligned' and 'sounds like an infection'); multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses the question's specific symptom combination (respiratory, temp, taste) and doctor's collective use for COVID alignment/infectious conclusion, with minor extras like swab/isolation that follow logically; no off-topic content."
