  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims that the transcript does not detail a medication regimen, whereas [P-40] explicitly mentions multivitamins. It also incorrectly claims the transcript does not provide information on the allergic reaction, whereas [P-38] explicitly mentions a rash.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer only successfully identifies the drug allergy (Penicillin). It fails to identify the medication (multivitamins) and the specific reaction (rash), covering only about 33% of the required information.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present. This constitutes a negative hallucination or failure of grounding.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to address all parts of the user's multi-part question, even though the content is factually flawed."
