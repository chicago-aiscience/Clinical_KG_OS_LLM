  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s core clinical linkage is consistent with the Gold Answer: dry, non-productive cough + scratchy throat + subjective fever + headache supports an uncomplicated URI, and the absence of sputum, GI symptoms, and joint pain helps narrow away from other syndromes. However, it introduces unsupported/overstated elements (e.g., repeated references to a “knowledge graph” defining what symptoms ‘indicate’ a common cold) and adds differential claims (e.g., ruling out pneumonia/arthritis/systemic viral infections) that are not stated in the Gold Answer and are somewhat overgeneralized. Overall, the main conclusion matches, with minor inaccuracies/overreach.",
    "completeness": "Covers several key Gold points: scratchy throat, dry cough, subjective fever/hot feeling, headache, and the negative ROS for sputum/phlegm, GI symptoms, and joint pain. Misses or under-emphasizes important Gold elements: the 3–4 day timeline as typical for URI, explicit mention of malaise/fatigue, the household exposure (brother’s recent cold), and that the doctor summarized the illness similarly. Net coverage is partial rather than full.",
    "faithfulness": "Many symptom statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references (dry cough/scratchy throat/headache/feeling hot; no sputum; no N/V/diarrhea; no joint aches). But the “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript, and the causal language that it ‘confirms’/‘maps directly’ is not supported. The added differential-rule-out statements (pneumonia, arthritis, “systemic viral infections”) are plausible but not transcript-based. This lowers grounding.",
    "relevance": "Mostly answers the question by explaining how the positive URI-type symptoms and the absence of sputum/GI/joint symptoms support a URI assessment. Minor tangents include the repeated “knowledge graph” framing and extra differential discussion beyond what’s needed."

  "summary": "The answer is largely consistent with a URI interpretation and uses the key symptom/negative-symptom pattern appropriately, but it omits several Gold details (timeline, exposure, malaise/fatigue) and includes non-transcript “knowledge graph” framing and some overgeneralized differential claims."
