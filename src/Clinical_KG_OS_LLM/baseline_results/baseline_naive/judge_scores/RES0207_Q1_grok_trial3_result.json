  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies sudden shortness of breath [P-1] as a respiratory symptom, seizure last night [P-8] as neurological, and 37.4 [P-5] as the fever measurement, matching facts in the Gold Answer without contradictions or errors; however, it has minor discrepancies by omitting the dry cough, epilepsy context, onset timing details, fever units (Celsius), and 'mild' description.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: sudden shortness of breath [P-1]; seizure last night [P-8]; fever of 37.4 [P-5]. Key points missed: dry cough onset and characteristics [D-2,P-2,D-4,P-4]; ~3-hour onset [P-11]; epilepsy diagnosis [P-8]; feeling fine post-seizure [P-8]; fever confirmed as morning measurement, described as mild [P-5,D-6,P-6]; pertinent negatives (no chest pain, no faintness, no prior SOB, no sore throat, no runny nose). Covers approximately 25-30% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: shortness of breath [P-1], seizure [P-8], temperature 37.4 [P-5]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly lists the requested respiratory symptom (SOB), neurological symptom (seizure), and fever measurement in a structured, focused format with no off-topic content, perfectly addressing the question."
