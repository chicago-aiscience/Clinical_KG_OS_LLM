  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies fever, fatigue, muscle aches, sore throat, and cough as symptoms the doctor explicitly referenced in the assessment summary (D-36). However, it incorrectly classifies “difficulty breathing” as part of the evidence for a general infectious process. In the Gold Answer, the doctor’s systemic-infection evidence is limited to the constitutional symptoms (fever, fatigue, myalgias), while the respiratory symptoms (especially shortness of breath) are part of what prevents ruling out COVID-19. The Generated Answer also omits that difficulty breathing was part of the COVID-19 concern set (in combination with sore throat/cough).",
    "completeness": "Covers: fever, fatigue, muscle aches (general infection) and sore throat/cough (COVID concern). Misses: that difficulty breathing/shortness of breath is a key feature the doctor linked to not being able to rule out COVID-19 (Gold emphasizes SOB + emerging URI symptoms). Also does not capture the Gold’s note that loss of taste/smell were elicited but not cited by the doctor in the D-36 synthesis (a nuance, but relevant to “which specific symptoms were cited”). Overall partial coverage of the two-layer structure.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms mentioned in the Generated Answer are present in the transcript (not hallucinated). The main issue is interpretive: it attributes “difficulty breathing” to the general infectious-process evidence rather than to the COVID-not-ruled-out rationale. This is a misinterpretation of the doctor’s layering in D-36 but remains grounded in the actual words used.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing symptoms for each category (general infection vs COVID not ruled out) without unnecessary tangents."
