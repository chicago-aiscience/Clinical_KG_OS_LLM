  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core triad of symptoms (worsening cough, fever, change in taste) matching the Gold Answer. However, it inaccurately refers to the parent as 'father' (it's the mother), uses incorrect citation [P-15] for cough worsening (P-15 is about appetite), mentions a non-existent 'medical knowledge graph,' and partially misrepresents the infectious conclusion by emphasizing cough and fever without highlighting the fever's specific role in distinguishing infection from asthma as in Gold [D-45]. Transcript typo 'allowed' is quoted directly but core alignment to COVID is preserved. Minor discrepancies but core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) dry cough worsening over 3 days [P-1,P-5,P-12] - covered but not specified as dry or exactly 3 days, wrong cites; (2) fever 100.1-101°F [P-1,P-2] - fully covered; (3) loss of taste [P-17] - covered; (4) D-44 alignment with COVID - covered; (5) D-45 fever concludes infection (vs. asthma without fever) - partially covered via cough/fever but misses explicit contrast and quote; (6) systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue, appetite), acute onset prioritizing viral - missed. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims grounded: symptoms from [P-1,P-2,P-17]; D-44 quote accurate to transcript ('allowed'). Minor issues: 'father' hallucination (parent is mother); [P-15] irrelevant to cough; 'medical knowledge graph' fabricated (absent); infectious conclusion infers from transcript but omits D-45 nuance. Citations mostly accurate, no major fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by breaking down the exact symptom combination (respiratory complaint, temperature, taste change) and doctor's use for COVID alignment and infectious conclusion, with minimal tangents like swab/isolation which relate to actions taken."
