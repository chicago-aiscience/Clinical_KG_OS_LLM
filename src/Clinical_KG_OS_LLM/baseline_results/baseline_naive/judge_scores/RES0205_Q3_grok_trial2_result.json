  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and correctly states the test was negative per [P-35], with evidence of persistent dry cough [P-2, P-5] and hospital worker status [P-34] matching the Gold Answer and transcript; no factual errors or contradictions, though less detailed.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnosis (COVID-19), hospital exposure [P-34, P-17], persistent cough; missed: specific flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose [P-13, P-14]), coworkers scared [P-35], PPE use [P-17], test timeline (2 weeks ago [P-36]), staying home [P-36], and patient disclosure phrasing [P-35]; covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: persistent cough [P-2], dry cough [P-5], hospital worker [P-34], negative test [P-35]; interpretive phrase on suspicion is plausible and grounded, no hallucinations or inaccurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's three parts (diagnosis investigated, evidence prompting it, testing results) with no off-topic content."
