  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely inconsistent with the Gold Answer. It incorrectly identifies “fatigue” and “sleep disturbance” as the key screened constitutional symptoms, but these were not framed as denied screening items; the patient volunteered tiredness/sleep disruption (P-19 to P-21). It omits the key denied constitutional symptoms that were explicitly screened: night sweats (D-5/P-5), unexplained weight loss/loose clothes (D-6 to D-8), and hemoptysis (D-10/P-10). It also mislabels eczema as an “exposure risk,” whereas it was simply past medical history and not part of infectious exposure screening. It further inaccurately describes the cough duration as “a month” rather than ~3 months (P-2, P-13).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed include: (1) denied night sweats, (2) denied unexplained weight loss/loose-fitting clothes, (3) denied hemoptysis, (4) denied sick contacts (class, recent contacts, roommate), (5) denied recent travel/exotic locales, (6) denied cocaine/heroin use and IV drug use, and (7) additional screened negatives (stiff neck, nausea/vomiting, body pain). The Generated Answer covers essentially none of the required “denied” symptoms/exposures and does not clearly connect the screening to excluding TB and other serious etiologies in the way the Gold Answer does (e.g., hemoptysis reducing concern for TB/malignancy).",
    "faithfulness": "Some quoted elements are present in the transcript (patient tiredness/sleep disruption in P-19; eczema history in P-22/P-23). However, the response is not faithful to the question/transcript intent: it portrays these as the main screened constitutional items and as if they were denied, which is not supported. Several statements are not grounded in the transcript (e.g., references to a “knowledge graph,” framing eczema as an exposure risk, and the erroneous cough timeline/subacute classification in this context).",
    "relevance": "The answer only partially aligns with the question. The question asks specifically which constitutional symptoms and exposure risks the doctor screened for that the patient denied, and what serious conditions these help exclude (e.g., TB). The Generated Answer fails to list the denied screening items and instead discusses reported fatigue/sleep disturbance and eczema, so it does not directly address the requested content."
