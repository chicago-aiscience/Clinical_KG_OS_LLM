  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error regarding family history. The transcript explicitly shows at D-26/P-26 that epilepsy runs in the family and the patient's mother had it, yet the Generated Answer incorrectly states 'no information available' about family history. The medication-related risk factor is correctly identified with accurate citations. This significant omission of documented family history information represents a major error.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the medication non-adherence and Keppra use but completely fails to address the hereditary predisposition and maternal family history of epilepsy, which constitutes half of the required answer. The Gold Answer specifically discusses both hereditary and medication factors, while the Generated Answer claims no hereditary information exists.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes false claims that contradict the transcript. It explicitly states 'no information available' regarding family history when D-26 asks 'Do you have any family history, any any diseases that run in your family?' and P-26 clearly responds 'Yeah, epilepsy runs in the family. My mom had it.' This is a hallucination of absence - claiming information doesn't exist when it clearly does in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question. It correctly discusses medication-related risk factors but fails to address the hereditary component of the question, which specifically asks 'What hereditary and medication-related risk factors' and 'how does the family history specifically relate to the patient's underlying epilepsy diagnosis?' The answer is only 50% relevant to the complete question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fails on multiple critical dimensions by incorrectly claiming no family history information exists when the transcript explicitly documents maternal epilepsy (D-26/P-26). While it correctly identifies medication non-adherence as a risk factor, it completely omits the hereditary predisposition component despite clear evidence in the source material. This represents both a factual error and unfaithfulness to the transcript, resulting in an incomplete answer that addresses only half of the question asked."
