  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer by claiming there is “no information available” about (1) father’s allergies, (2) cousin’s asthma, (3) brother’s recent cold, and (4) farm/COVID home-schooling context—each of which is explicitly present in the transcript (e.g., P-33, P-30, P-39 to P-45). It also introduces an unsupported “diagnosis” of common cold via a “Knowledge Graph,” which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer. Additionally, it characterizes “night sweats” as part of the symptom cluster; the transcript includes a night sweats question but does not document classic night sweats (soaked sheets), only feeling hot (P-9).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) family atopy/asthma context (father allergies; cousin asthma), (2) allergy season not started yet suggesting current episode differs from typical allergies, (3) brother’s cold a few weeks/~2 weeks prior as likely exposure, (4) isolated living situation during COVID (home schooling; parents working from home/farm; she doesn’t leave house; no travel), (5) farm with only a dog (not animal farm) reduces animal exposure concern. Generated Answer omits essentially all of these relationships and instead denies the information exists; it only restates some current symptoms and her personal allergy history.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: (1) the claim that the contextual factors are not present (they are), (2) the asserted “Knowledge Graph” diagnosis of common cold, and (3) implying night sweats are present. While it accurately lists some symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, feeling hot) and her allergy history, the central claims are unfaithful to the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The question asks how the specified contextual factors collectively relate to her current URI symptoms. The Generated Answer largely fails to address this, instead stating the information is unavailable and shifting to a generic symptom summary and an unsupported diagnosis. Only minimally related content is provided."
