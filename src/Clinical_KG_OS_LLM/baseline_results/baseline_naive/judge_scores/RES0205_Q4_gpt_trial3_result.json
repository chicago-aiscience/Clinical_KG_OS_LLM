  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and that a COVID test was used, consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer (P-35).\n- Incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify when the test was done relative to symptom onset. The patient explicitly says: “I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago” (P-36). This is a clear factual error.\n- Workplace concern included (coworkers scared when patient coughs) is correct (P-35), but other workplace-related aspects emphasized in the Gold Answer (hospital setting, PPE, staying home, wanting to return without coughing) are omitted rather than contradicted.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered vs missed:\n- Covered: (1) Condition ruled out = COVID-19; (2) Test = COVID test; (3) Coworkers scared at work when patient coughs.\n- Missed: (1) Timing of test relative to symptom onset (performed at onset ~2 weeks prior); (2) Patient works at a hospital (clerk) and the importance of infection-control context; (3) Patient wears PPE; (4) Staying home since test and desire to return to work but not be coughing; (5) medication request linked to returning to work.\nOverall, it captures only a minority of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are grounded in the transcript (COVID test/negative; coworkers scared).\n- However, it introduces an unsupported “Knowledge Graph” assertion, which is not in the transcript.\n- The claim that timing is not explicitly specified is not faithful to the transcript (P-36 explicitly provides timing). This is a notable ungrounded/contradictory statement.",
    "relevance": "- The response is generally focused on the four items asked (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns).\n- It is weakened by failing to provide the requested timing (despite it being present) and only partially addressing workplace-related concerns.\n- The “Knowledge Graph” aside is a minor irrelevant addition."
