  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain information on a specific medication tried prior to the visit, directly contradicting [P-10] where the patient explicitly mentions trying 'decongestants,' as noted in the Gold Answer. It also misattributes the patient's assessment of effectiveness to overall symptom persistence from [P-1] rather than the specific 'worked a little bit' comment on decongestants in [P-10]. The recommendation of Tylenol Cold is correct but incomplete compared to Gold. Overall, significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) patient tried OTC decongestants [P-10]; (2) assessment 'worked a little bit' with explanation of symptom shift [P-10]; (3) doctor recommended hydration, Tylenol Cold, supportive care for viral illness taking weeks [D-39]. Covered: only Tylenol Cold partially (~10-20%). Missed: tried decongestants (100%), effectiveness assessment (100%), hydration and viral context (100%).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about no medication tried and assessment from [P-1] are not verifiable and incorrect, as [P-10] directly states 'I've tried like decongestants... that worked a little bit,' indicating hallucination of absence. Citations to [P-1] and [D-39] are accurate but misused for wrong conclusions. Tylenol Cold claim verifiable in [D-39]. Multiple hallucinated absences.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured perfectly to address the three-part question directly (medication tried, assessment, OTC recommended), with no irrelevant content or tangents."
