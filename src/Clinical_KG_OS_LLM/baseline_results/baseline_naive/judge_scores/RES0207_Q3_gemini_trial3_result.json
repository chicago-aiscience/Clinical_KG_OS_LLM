  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core connection between the missed Keppra dose and the seizure, accurately quoting the patient's recognition of the link from P-9.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key supporting details present in the Gold Answer: 1) It does not mention that the patient's admission was voluntary/spontaneous in response to a different question (D-9); 2) It omits the patient's remark that they 'don't get seizures very often', which helps establish the missed dose as a specific trigger; 3) It fails to include the situational context from P-24 (daughter's birthday) which explains the nature of the missed dose.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is fully grounded in the transcript and does not contain hallucinations. All citations provided (P-9, P-8, P-23) are accurate to the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the question asked, focusing on the connection between the medication and the seizure and the patient's recognition thereof."
