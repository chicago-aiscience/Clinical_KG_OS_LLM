{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer for the points it includes. It correctly identifies the exposure history (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening), the duration (>72 hours), and the prior history (10 years ago, target rash).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses one of the four specific components requested in the question: the geographic risk assessment. The question explicitly asks how the geographic risk assessment (Strathroy/Ontario map) contributed to the recommendation, which is covered in the Gold Answer but entirely omitted in the Generated Answer. It covers approximately 75% of the requested points.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. All claims regarding the timeline, the 72-hour threshold, and the patient's past history are supported by the text and accurately cited.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question, though it is incomplete by failing to address the geographic component specified in the prompt."
