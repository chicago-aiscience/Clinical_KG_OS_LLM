  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the sharp/strong quality and the 20-minute duration. However, it suggests that physical exertion (running) may be a trigger, whereas the patient explicitly states that the pain does not get worse with exercise and stays the same when walking. The gold answer correctly notes the denial of worsening with exercise.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer: the 1.5-week total duration, the initial description of the sensation as 'odd' or 'uncomfortable', the fact that the pain occurs at rest, and most importantly, the entire section on when the pain resolves (talking to people/hands-on tasks), which was explicitly requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript with specific citations. The inference regarding running as a trigger is based on the patient's stated nervousness, though it conflicts with the patient's direct answer regarding exercise in P-10.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer addresses the quality and duration of the pain well. However, it only partially addresses the situational prompt, providing situations where the pain occurs but completely omitting the 'versus resolve' component asked for in the question."
