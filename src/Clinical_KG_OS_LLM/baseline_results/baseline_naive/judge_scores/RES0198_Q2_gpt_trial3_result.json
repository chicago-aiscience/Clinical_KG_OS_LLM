  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incorrect on the key elements asked. The transcript explicitly states the patient tried OTC “decongestants” [P-10], but the answer claims there is no information about a medication tried. The patient’s effectiveness assessment in the transcript is that it “worked a little bit” (some relief of stuffiness as the nose became runny) [P-10], whereas the answer instead uses a more general statement that symptoms were not getting better [P-1], which does not match the specific effectiveness appraisal. The doctor’s recommendation of OTC “Tylenol cold” is correctly captured [D-39].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points:\n- Patient tried OTC decongestants: MISSED/contradicted.\n- Patient felt it helped a little bit (stuffy → runny): MISSED.\n- Doctor recommended OTC Tylenol Cold: INCLUDED.\n- Supportive care/hydration and expectation symptoms may take weeks: OMITTED (not required by the question’s last clause but included in Gold as part of going-forward recommendation).",
    "faithfulness": "The statement that the transcript contains no information about a medication tried is directly contradicted by [P-10] (“decongestants”). The effectiveness characterization is not faithful to [P-10], which indicates partial benefit, not simply no improvement. The Tylenol Cold recommendation is faithful to [D-39].",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the three items asked (prior medication, perceived effectiveness, and recommended OTC treatment), with no major tangents."
