  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a factual error regarding the transition of the cough. It states the transition to a dry cough occurred after two to three days, but the transcript specifically mentions the mucus production lasted for four to five days [P-6]. Additionally, while it mentions the current intensity of the cough, it fails to state that the intensity and frequency have remained stable over the two-week period as noted in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover several key points explicitly requested in the prompt. It omits the description of the mucus ('whitish clear') and does not explain that the intensity and frequency of the cough remained unchanged over time. It also misses details from the Gold Answer such as the lack of fever and the negative COVID test results which are part of the 'complete timeline'.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript but misinterprets the duration of mucus production, attributing the 2-3 day window of flu symptoms to the mucus transition, which the transcript separates as a 4-5 day window.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, directly addressing the prompt's request for a timeline of symptom progression and following the suggested structure."
