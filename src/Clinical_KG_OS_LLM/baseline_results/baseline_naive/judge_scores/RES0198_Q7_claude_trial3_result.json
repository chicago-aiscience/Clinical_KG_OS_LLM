    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several significant factual errors when compared to the Gold Answer. Most critically, it incorrectly states the symptoms were 'on and off' throughout the week, when the patient actually clarified they were 'pretty constant' [P-8]. It also fails to accurately describe the progression from predominantly stuffy to predominantly runny, which is clearly stated in [P-3] ('It felt pretty stuffy at first, but now it's mostly running'). The Generated Answer claims the transcript 'does not specify which of the two appeared first,' which directly contradicts [P-3]. Additionally, it incorrectly references [P-15] regarding discharge consistency, when [P-15] actually discusses fatigue.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses or misrepresents several key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the clear progression from stuffy to runny symptoms, (2) the correct characterization of symptoms as constant rather than intermittent, (3) the initial presenting symptom being congestion, (4) the clarification that 'on and off' in [P-1] was later corrected to 'constant' in [P-8], and (5) the potential influence of decongestants on the symptom transition. It does correctly identify the one-week duration and lack of improvement.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains several claims that contradict the transcript. It states symptoms were 'on and off' throughout, ignoring the patient's explicit clarification in [P-8] that they were 'pretty constant.' It claims the transcript doesn't specify which symptom came first, despite clear evidence in [P-3]. It incorrectly cites [P-15] regarding discharge description when that exchange concerns fatigue. The answer appears to rely on the initial description in [P-1] while ignoring the doctor's follow-up questions that provided more precise information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address all components of the question (onset, symptom order, progression, and constant vs. intermittent pattern), making it structurally relevant. However, the content is significantly flawed in its interpretation of the transcript, leading to answers that are factually incorrect despite being topically on-target."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates structural understanding of what information was requested but contains multiple significant factual errors and misinterpretations of the transcript. Most critically, it incorrectly characterizes the symptoms as intermittent when they were explicitly stated to be constant, fails to identify the progression from predominantly stuffy to predominantly runny, and makes citation errors. While it addresses the question's components, the inaccuracies substantially undermine its clinical utility."
