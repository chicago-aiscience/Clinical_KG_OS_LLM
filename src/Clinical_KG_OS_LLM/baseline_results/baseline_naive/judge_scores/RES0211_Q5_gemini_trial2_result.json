    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that information about family history, the brother's illness, and the living situation is missing from the transcript, whereas all these elements are clearly present (P-30, P-33, P-39, P-42, P-43). The gold answer confirms these facts are in the source.",
