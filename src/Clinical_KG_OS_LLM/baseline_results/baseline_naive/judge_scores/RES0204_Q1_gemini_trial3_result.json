  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript and gold answer regarding the presence of a dry, non-productive cough and a runny nose. It correctly identifies the nature of the cough.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer: it omits the duration of the symptoms (4-5 days for the cough, a couple of days for the runny nose), the stability of the cough (stayed the same), the specific appearance of the nasal discharge ('pretty clear'), and the pertinent negatives (denial of sore throat, chest pain, wheezing, or shortness of breath).",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript and correctly cite the speakers (D-5, D-11, D-12).",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but fails to provide the specific 'appearance of the nasal discharge' requested in the prompt, stating instead that it was 'being assessed'. It also ignores the request for 'characteristics' by omitting the duration and stability of the symptoms."
