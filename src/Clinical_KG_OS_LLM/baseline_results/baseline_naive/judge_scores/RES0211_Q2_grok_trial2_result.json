  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports Claritin as carried but not actively taken for allergies (matches Gold [P-16, P-25]), Deyo as taken for birth control (matches Gold [P-25, P-26]), and past allergy shots in some years (matches Gold [P-16]). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer; all stated details are consistent, though some Gold details are omitted.",
    "completeness": "Covered: Claritin (name, indication allergies, status carrying 'just in case' not currently taking); Deyo (name, indication birth control, status taking). Missed: Deyo dosing 'goes for three months' and confirmation as oral pill not IUD; denial of medication allergies; allergy shots dosing 'once a week for a little while in winter'; no EpiPen carried; allergies are seasonal without severe symptoms like swelling or breathing difficulty. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: Claritin [P-16][P-25], Deyo [P-26], allergy shots [P-16]. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around current medications/carrying (Claritin, Deyo with indications and status) and past allergist treatments (allergy shots), using bullet points for clarity; no off-topic content."
