  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the timeline (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening) and the core comparison points (bullseye rash vs. localized redness, engorged vs. small tick). However, it misinterprets the patient's phrasing in [P-3]. The patient states 'it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot' to contrast the appearance with the previous bullseye rash, later adding 'I don't think it was as bad as that time'. The generated answer claims the current site was 'more sore', which suggests a higher intensity of pain than the previous episode, contradicting the patient's assessment.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the major milestones of the timeline and the comparison. It misses the specific timing of discovery ('earlier today') and the doctor's specific descriptor of an engorged tick as a 'little grape', which were present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is grounded in the transcript but contains one minor hallucination/misinterpretation regarding the intensity of soreness ('more sore'). This likely stems from a literal interpretation of the filler word 'more' in [P-3] rather than the speaker's intended contrast between symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing strictly on the timeline and the comparison requested by the question."
