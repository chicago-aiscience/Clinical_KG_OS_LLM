    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. While it correctly identifies the tick attachment duration reasoning from [D-6], it falsely claims that 'The provided transcript segments...do not contain any information regarding Strathroy or a discussion about the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map.' This directly contradicts the transcript, where the patient explicitly states she was 'in Strathroy along the creek' [P-12] and the doctor discusses the Lyme disease distribution map, stating 'Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point' [D-13]. This is a major factual error that contradicts readily verifiable information in the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer only covers approximately 50% of the required content. It adequately addresses the tick attachment duration component with proper citations from [P-1] and [D-6]. However, it completely fails to address the second half of the question regarding how Strathroy's position on the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map was used to justify prophylactic treatment. The Gold Answer clearly shows this information exists in [P-12] and [D-13], but the Generated Answer incorrectly claims this information is not present in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination. It claims that information about Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map is not present in the transcript segments, when this information is explicitly present in [P-12] and [D-13]. This represents a fabricated claim about what is not in the source material, which is as problematic as fabricating content that should be there. The portion about tick attachment duration is faithful to the transcript, but the false denial of existing content severely undermines overall faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. The first section addressing tick attachment duration directly answers that portion of the question with appropriate detail and citations. However, the second section fails to address the geographic risk component of the question, instead incorrectly claiming the information doesn't exist. Since the question explicitly asks about both components (attachment duration AND geographic justification), failing to address one major component significantly reduces relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly addresses the tick attachment duration component with accurate citations from [P-1] and [D-6], explaining how the Friday hiking and Saturday gardening led to an estimated 72+ hour attachment. However, it contains a critical factual error by claiming the transcript does not contain information about Strathroy or the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, when this information is explicitly present in [P-12] and [D-13]. This false claim represents both a correctness failure and a hallucination, as it denies the existence of verifiable transcript content. The answer only covers half of what the question asks, missing the entire geographic risk justification component that is clearly documented in the source material."
