  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not describe changes in sputum character, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions a change from clear/white to yellow [P-6]. It also claims the patient did not endorse systemic symptoms, missing the endorsement of 'feeling a bit chilly' [P-29].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to address key components of the prompt. It misses the specific details of the sputum change (clear-to-white vs. yellow) and the systemic symptom (chills). It also omits the chest discomfort associated with coughing fits [P-13].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates an absence of information. It claims the patient did not provide details regarding sputum or systemic symptoms, which is directly contradicted by several lines in the transcript (P-6, P-29).",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address the question's categories, but because it fails to find the relevant information in the text, it provides mostly 'not mentioned' responses for details that were actually present."
