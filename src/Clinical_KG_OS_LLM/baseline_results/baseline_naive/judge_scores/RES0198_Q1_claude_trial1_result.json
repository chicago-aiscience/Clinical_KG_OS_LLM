  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the stuffy and runny nose symptoms and accurately describes the nasal discharge as mostly clear, with proper citations. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating the patient 'did not explicitly deny any of the specific related symptoms' when the transcript clearly shows multiple explicit denials: cough [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat/shortness of breath/fevers/chills [P-7], and loss of taste/smell [P-16]. The reference to [P-27] about diabetes is irrelevant and incorrect.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers approximately 40% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy/runny nose, clear discharge, one week duration) but completely misses the critical denials of cough, post-nasal drip, sore throat, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, and loss of taste/smell. It also omits the temporal progression (stuffy first, then mostly running), the mild fatigue, and additional pertinent negatives like headache, chest pain, etc.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is partially grounded in the transcript. The nasal symptoms and discharge character are accurately cited. However, the claim that the patient 'did not explicitly deny any of the specific related symptoms' directly contradicts multiple passages in the transcript where clear denials are documented [P-4, P-6, P-7, P-16]. The reference to [P-27] appears to be a misinterpretation of the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant. It directly addresses the nasal symptoms and discharge character portions of the question, but fails to address the critical third component about explicitly denied symptoms, instead providing incorrect information that these denials were not present. The irrelevant reference to diabetes concerns detracts from relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies basic nasal symptoms and discharge character but contains a critical error in stating that related symptoms were not explicitly denied, when the transcript clearly documents multiple denials (cough, post-nasal drip, sore throat, loss of taste/smell). Coverage is incomplete at approximately 40% of Gold Answer key points, missing important temporal details, mild fatigue, and comprehensive symptom denials. While mostly grounded in the transcript for nasal symptoms, the incorrect claim about denials and irrelevant diabetes reference reduce faithfulness and relevance scores."
