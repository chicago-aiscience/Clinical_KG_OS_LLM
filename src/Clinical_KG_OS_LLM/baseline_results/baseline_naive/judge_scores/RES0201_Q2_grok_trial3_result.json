  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer correctly identifies mild COPD managed with long-acting beta agonist (P-28) and vitamins (P-30), no allergies (P-31), and self-treatments (P-6). Generated Answer falsely states 'no prescribed medications for chronic disease management,' contradicting transcript (P-27-P-30). Self-treatment details match accurately. This is a significant factual error/contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: COPD diagnosis; long-acting beta agonist; vitamins; no allergies; self-treatments (gargle, painkillers, no relief). Generated covers only self-treatments (~25% coverage), misses all chronic management points entirely.",
    "faithfulness": "Self-treatment claims verifiable (P-6, accurate citations). Claim of no chronic/prescribed meds not verifiable and contradicts transcript (P-27-P-30; beta agonist is prescription for COPD). Planned tests verifiable (D-43) but correctly noted as non-medications. Overall, includes hallucinated denial of meds.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications/treatments (self-treatment yes, chronic wrongly denied). Minor tangent on planned procedures but dismissed appropriately. Mostly on-topic for question."
