  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, correctly states that a swab test was ordered, correctly reports the expected turnaround time as 24–48 hours, and correctly states that an alternative diagnosis considered (if negative) was another viral illness circulating at that time of year. These match the Gold Answer and are directly supported by [D-52]. No contradictions or factual errors are present.",
    "completeness": "Compared to the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer includes all elements required by the question (rule-out condition, test type, turnaround time, alternative diagnosis). However, it omits additional points present in the Gold Answer: instruction to isolate for 14 days, public health contact tracing if positive, and the note that management is supportive regardless. Because these are in the Gold Answer but not in the Generated Answer, completeness is slightly reduced relative to the Gold Answer overall.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly grounded in the transcript, specifically [D-52]. There are no added clinical details beyond what is stated (no hallucinations).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is tightly focused on exactly what the question asks (condition to rule out, test and turnaround time, alternative if negative) and does not include irrelevant tangents."
