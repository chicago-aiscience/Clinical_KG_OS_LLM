{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript ends at [P-23] with no doctor communication on next steps, which is factually incorrect as the full transcript extends to [D-38], including [D-37] where next steps are explicitly discussed; this directly contradicts the Gold Answer's accurate summary of [D-37] and [D-38], making it mostly incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: doctor will review info with another doctor ([D-37]), return shortly to discuss ([D-37,D-38]), possible tests and management plan pending ([D-37]), collaborative process, no specifics ordered, patient agreement ([P-37]). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead asserting information unavailable due to incomplete transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that transcript ends at [P-23] (false; it goes to [D-38]), misrepresents content by ignoring later turns like [D-37] where claims would be verifiable, includes fabricated summary of 'available context' limited to early turns; largely fabricated interpretation of transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer attempts to address the question on next steps but concludes 'cannot be determined' based on erroneous transcript reading, includes off-topic early summary ([P-1],[P-8],[P-9],[P-23]), making it partially relevant with some off-topic content."
