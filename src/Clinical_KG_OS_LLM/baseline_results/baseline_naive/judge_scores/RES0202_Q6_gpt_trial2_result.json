  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated assessment/plan in the transcript and Gold Answer: COVID swab ordered with 24–48h turnaround, 14-day isolation including away from younger sister, acknowledgment of possible false negatives, alternative explanation of another circulating viral illness if negative, and ER return precautions (high fever, neurologic symptoms such as seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). No contradictory or incorrect details were introduced.",
    "completeness": "It covers most key elements from the Gold Answer (test + turnaround time, isolation duration + separation from sister, false negatives, alternative viral illness, specific ER warning signs with an example). It misses the additional differential/clinical nuance from D-45 that asthma would be considered if cough/SOB occurred without fever, and it does not explicitly note the “watchful waiting/no medications prescribed” aspect.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are grounded in D-44 (and consistent with the transcript). It does not add medications or other interventions not mentioned. Minor omission of D-45 content, but no hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question’s requested components (test and timing, isolation, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negatives, and specific ER warning signs with an example). No irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded summary of the doctor’s plan, but not fully complete because it omits the asthma-consideration nuance (and the explicit no-medication/watchful-waiting note) from the Gold Answer."
