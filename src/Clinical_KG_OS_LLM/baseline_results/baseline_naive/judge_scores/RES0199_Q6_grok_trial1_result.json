  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the management plan from the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52], including the COVID-19 swab test, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and supportive care details like hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fevers if they occur, and pain relief for aches. Minor discrepancies include omitting the 24-48 hour results timeframe, not mentioning the alternative viral illness diagnosis, using 'analgesics' instead of the transcript's 'NSAIDs' (likely a transcription error in source as 'anseads'), and not explicitly stating no prescription medications beyond supportive care. These are minor and do not alter core facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab (partial, misses timeframe), 14-day isolation (full), contact tracing if positive (full), supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep well, Tylenol for fevers if any - full; Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches - mostly, but 'analgesics' instead). Missed: explicit 24-48 hour results expectation, alternative viral illness if negative, and statement on no prescription meds. Covers approximately 85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in transcript [D-52], with accurate citations; 'Tylenol or analgesics' is a minor generalization of 'Tylenol or anseads' (NSAIDs), but no fabricated content or hallucinations present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured to directly address the question's specified elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), with no off-topic content."
