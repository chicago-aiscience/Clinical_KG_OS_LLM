  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the recent stress and the onset of chest pain. However, it incorrectly suggests that the patient may have had 'chest pain issues' during her teenage years ('potentially contributing to the anxiety and chest pain issues she faced during her teenage years'). This directly contradicts the transcript [P-17], where the patient explicitly states she has never felt this pain before. It also misses the specific start age of smoking (18) and the 8-year period of being symptom-free mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main phases requested (smoking, teenage anxiety, academic stress, chest pain) but misses critical timeline details found in the Gold Answer: the specific age of starting smoking (18), the escalation to 10 cigarettes/day over the last two years, the 8-year gap between teenage anxiety and the current episode, and the fact that the father's heart attack occurred 'last year'.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant hallucination/contradiction by claiming smoking contributed to chest pain in the patient's teenage years; the transcript records that the chest pain is a new symptom [P-17] and smoking only began at age 18. Furthermore, the answer repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source materials, indicating the use of external or hallucinated context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing the tracing of the timeline and the relationships between the phases as requested by the prompt."
