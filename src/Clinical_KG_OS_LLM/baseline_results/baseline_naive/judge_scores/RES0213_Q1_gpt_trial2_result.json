  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly reports the pain quality as “very sharp, strong” and pleuritic with deep inspiration [P-3], and the typical episode duration of ~20 minutes [P-6]. It also correctly notes common contexts of occurrence (sitting/studying; walking to school) [P-4]. However, it introduces an inaccurate inference that “physical exertion may be a trigger” based on the patient being nervous to run [P-28]; this is not supported and conflicts with the patient’s statement that it does not worsen with exercise/walking stays the same [P-10].",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are missing: (1) symptom course for ~1.5 weeks and initial description as “uncomfortable/odd” [P-2]; (2) intermittent recurrence “here and there,” not constant [P-6, P-7]; (3) the key ‘occurs when alone’ framing (walking alone/studying alone) [P-9, P-29]; (4) when it tends to resolve or be unnoticed—when at school, talking to people, with classmates, or doing hands-on tasks [P-9, P-29]; (5) can occur at rest [D-11, P-11]; (6) denies worsening with exercise [P-10]; (7) no injury and no prior episodes [P-5, P-17]. The generated answer covers only a subset (quality, duration, some occurrence situations) and does not address “resolve vs occur” adequately.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (sharp/strong with deep breath; ~20 minutes; studying/walking to school). The added suggestion that exertion may trigger the pain is not stated in the transcript and is contrary to the patient’s report about exercise [P-10], making the answer only partially grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response stays mostly focused on the requested characteristics (quality, duration, and occurrence contexts). However, it fails to describe the situations in which the pain resolves/goes unnoticed (a core part of the question) and adds a speculative point about exertion that is not needed."
