  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple factual errors when compared to the Gold Answer and Source Transcript. It explicitly states that the nature of the cough was not described (P-12 states it is 'mostly a dry cough'), the frequency of diarrhea was not specified (P-28 specifies 'five or six times a day'), the number of vomiting episodes was not specified (P-32 specifies 'two times'), and the headache severity was not provided (P-8 specifies a '7' out of 10).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It identifies the presence of symptoms but misses every specific detail requested by the prompt (nature of cough, frequency, count, and severity rating), incorrectly claiming they are missing from the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript. It makes false negative claims about the absence of information. The transcript clearly contains the data points the model claims are missing (P-8, P-12, P-28, P-32).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant to the specific sub-questions asked. While it identifies the symptoms mentioned in the prompt, it fails to provide the 'specific characteristics' requested, which was the primary goal of the question."
