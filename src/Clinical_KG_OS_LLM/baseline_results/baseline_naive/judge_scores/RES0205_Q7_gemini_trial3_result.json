  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a factual error regarding the timeline of mucus production and the transition to a dry cough; it states this occurred after 2-3 days, whereas the transcript [P-6] specifically states it lasted 4-5 days. It also fails to mention that the intensity and frequency of the cough remained stable over the two-week period [P-7, P-8].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer and the prompt: it does not describe what the mucus looked like (whitish/clear), it omits the specific flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose), it doesn't mention the lack of fever, and it misses the negative COVID test result mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful but hallucinates the timeline of the cough transition (2-3 days) which contradicts the transcript's 4-5 day estimate. The claim that the cough is 'now frequent and intense' misses the patient's statement that it has been 'kind of the same' throughout.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant and directly attempts to answer the prompt's request for a timeline, though it fails to include all specific details requested in the prompt (e.g., what the mucus looked like)."
