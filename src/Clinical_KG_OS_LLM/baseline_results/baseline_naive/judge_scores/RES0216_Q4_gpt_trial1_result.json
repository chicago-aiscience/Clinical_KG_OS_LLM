  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as a “cardiac ischemic picture/cardiac ischemia,” which matches the Gold Answer and the transcript (D-36). It also accurately reports the clinician’s rationale that the symptoms were chest tightness rather than pain and that the clinician noted the patient “didn’t really get out of breath with exercise” (D-36). Minor issue: it leans on P-1 for “not really pain,” whereas the clearer denial is at P-5, but this does not change the factual conclusion.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) cardiac ischemic picture lower on differential; (2) chest symptoms characterized as tightness rather than pain; (3) clinician cited lack of classic exertional dyspnea pattern (“didn’t really get out of breath with exercise”); (4) absence of pain. Key points missed: the Gold Answer also highlights other pertinent negatives the clinician screened for—anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom (P-6/D-6)—as supportive evidence against acute cardiac etiologies. The question explicitly asks for absence of certain symptoms, including these, so this omission is material.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript: cardiac ischemia being lower on the differential (D-36), tightness with breathing in (P-1), and no pain associated (D-36; also consistent with P-1/P-5). It does not introduce unsupported symptoms or diagnoses.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on what was placed lower on the differential and the symptom-based reasoning the clinician cited. It directly addresses the question, though it omits some of the requested absent-symptom findings."

  "summary": "Accurately identifies cardiac ischemia as lower on the differential and cites tightness/no pain and lack of exertional dyspnea, but it incompletely answers the question by omitting the clinician-screened absent red-flag symptoms (anxiety/sweating/impending doom)."
