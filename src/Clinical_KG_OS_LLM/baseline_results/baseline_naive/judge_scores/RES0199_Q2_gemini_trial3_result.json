  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer regarding the medication taken at home (Tylenol for headache) and the specific recommendations made by the doctor (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, and NSAIDs for aches). It correctly identifies the phonetic spelling 'anseads' from the transcript for NSAIDs.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures most key points but misses a few details present in the Gold Answer: the patient's self-initiated hydration efforts prior to the visit, the doctor's order for a COVID-19 swab, and the instruction to isolate for 14 days. While it covers all 'medications' and the primary 'supportive measures', the isolation instruction is a significant part of the management plan missed.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using the exact phrasing (including 'anseads') and providing correct turn citations ([P-3], [D-52]).",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant to the question, providing a structured response that addresses each part of the query without extraneous information."
