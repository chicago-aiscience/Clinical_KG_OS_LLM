  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies three key symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough) as the basis for suspicion, notes the patient's initial COVID concern [P-1], doctor's explicit connection [D-39], test details, confirmation of absent symptoms (fever [P-10], dyspnea [P-11], etc.), 'pretty well' summary [D-16], and self-isolation. Generated Answer incorrectly limits symptoms to only loss of taste and dry cough (omitting loss of smell despite quoting it in [P-1] and its prominence in [P-4,D-16]), omits patient's concern, absent symptoms, and self-isolation; hallucinates 'knowledge graph'. Significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) three symptoms (smell, taste, cough); (2) patient COVID worry [P-1]; (3) doctor connection [D-39]; (4) swab test [D-39]; (5) absent symptoms (fever, dyspnea, sore throat, chest pain); (6) 'pretty well' [D-16]; (7) narrow profile supports testing/isolation. Covered: partial (1) taste/cough, full (3), full (4). Missed: full smell in (1), (2), (5), (6), (7). Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms partially verifiable [P-1,P-4,P-6,P-7] but claim limits to taste/cough only (ignores smell emphasized throughout); connection and test verifiable [D-39]. Hallucination: 'knowledge graph provided' not in transcript. Citations accurate but content misrepresents symptom combo as transcript includes smell as primary [P-1,D-16]. Multiple inaccuracies/hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly identifies (partial) symptom combo, quotes doctor's connection [D-39], specifies test (swab); fully addresses question structure despite errors. Minor irrelevant 'knowledge graph' mention."
