  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the condition as 'covid' (matching Gold's 'COVID-19'), the test as 'swab', turnaround time as '24 to 48 hours', and alternative diagnosis as 'another viral illness' (matching Gold). All facts are fully consistent with no errors, though it uses lowercase 'covid' minorly.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: condition to rule out (COVID), test (swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours), alternative diagnosis (viral illness). Missed: isolation for 14 days, positive result actions (public health contact tracing), and supportive management note. Covers core question elements (100%) but ~80% of Gold's detailed points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] of transcript (e.g., 'rule out as covid', 'take a swab...24 to 48 hours', 'if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness'). Accurate citation, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question's elements (condition, test+time, alternative diagnosis) in structured bullet points with no off-topic content."
