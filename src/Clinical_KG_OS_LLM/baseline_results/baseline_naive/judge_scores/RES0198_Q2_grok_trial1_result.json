  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer correctly identifies that the patient tried 'decongestants' [P-10] with assessment 'worked a little bit' [P-10]; Generated Answer incorrectly states no information on medication tried and misattributes assessment to [P-1] instead of [P-10], only partially correct on recommendation; significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: tried decongestants [P-10], assessment 'little bit effective' with reasoning [P-10], recommend hydration and Tylenol Cold + supportive care [D-39]; Generated covers only Tylenol Cold partially, misses tried medication and correct assessment entirely (covers ~25% of key points).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims 'no information' on medication tried, but [P-10] explicitly states 'I've tried like decongestants'; assessment wrongly sourced to [P-1] ignoring [P-10]; Tylenol verifiable [D-39]; multiple unverifiable/wrong claims equivalent to hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly around the three-part question (medication tried, assessment, recommendation) with no tangents or off-topic content."
