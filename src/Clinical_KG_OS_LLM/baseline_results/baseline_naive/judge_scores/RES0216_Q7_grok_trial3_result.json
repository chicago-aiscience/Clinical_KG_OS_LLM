  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the onset approximately three days prior [P-1] and first notice during dog walk [P-1, accurate fact from P-4]. It accurately describes tightness on inspiration and harder breathing [P-1, P-5]. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript 'does not explicitly state' whether symptoms improved, worsened, or stayed the same, directly contradicting P-2 ('staying the same') and P-3 ('pretty steady'), which are core to Gold. It misses baseline 'always there' [P-9], other exacerbators (chair, big breath [P-9]), specific walk reduction (2 to 1 [P-22]), and no work miss [P-22]. Includes extraneous asthma difference [P-16] not emphasized in Gold for this. Significant factual errors/omissions vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: onset 3 days (covered), first on dog walk (covered), no specific trigger (missed), staying same/steady (missed, denied), always there but worse on walk/chair/big breath (partial: only walk), inspiration (covered), reduced to 1 walk/day (missed), no work miss (missed), noticeably limiting (partial vague). Covers ~30-40% (onset, first activity, inspiration, general walk impact), misses major parts like progression, full exacerbators, precise routine change.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: 3 days/tightness/inhalation/harder breathe [P-1], walk trigger/exacerb [P-1,P-4,P-9], routine impact [P-1,P-22], different from asthma [P-16]. Citations mostly accurate (P-1 supports). However, 'does not explicitly state progression' is unverifiable/false as P-2/P-3 directly state 'staying the same/steady'; implies concerning from seeking care (plausible but indirect). No fabricated facts, but erroneous denial and minor citation imprecision (P-1 vs P-4 for first notice). Some ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Answer is structured directly around question elements (development, triggering activity, exacerbating factors, impact on routine, current status), with bullet points matching query aspects; no off-topic content or tangents."
