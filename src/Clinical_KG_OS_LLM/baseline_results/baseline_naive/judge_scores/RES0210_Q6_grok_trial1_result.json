  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript (segments [P-1] to [P-42]) lacks the doctor's stated plan at the end, but [D-43] explicitly includes it ('go over this with the physician I’m working with and we should be back shortly together to talk to you about the next steps'), directly contradicting the Gold Answer. Self-care measures miss Tylenol [P-14] and expectoration relief [P-13], only covering exertion avoidance [P-10] partially. Aggravating factors partially match (deep breathing [P-19], coughing [P-19]) but omit exertion [P-10/P-11]. Alleviating factors wrongly claim no explicit statements, missing key points, and misreference runny nose [P-16] irrelevantly. Significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Doctor's plan [D-43] (0% covered); self-care Tylenol+effect [P-14], expectoration+effect [P-13], taking it easy [P-10] (only ~33% via exertion); aggravating deep breathing [P-18], coughing [P-19], exertion [P-10/11] (~67% via breathing/coughing); alleviating Tylenol [P-14], expectoration [P-13], resting [P-10] (0% covered). Overall covers ~20-49% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims doctor's plan absent despite clear [D-43] in transcript (hallucination/misreading). Self-care grounded in [P-10] accurately. Aggravating factors verifiable: coughing [P-15/P-19], deep breathing [P-19]. Alleviating wrongly asserts none explicit (ignores [P-13/P-14]); misuses [P-16] runny nose as alleviating (not relevant/accurate). Multiple unverifiable/misrepresented claims, especially plan absence.",
    "relevance": "Structured response directly addresses each question part (plan, self-care, aggravating/alleviating factors), with focused clinical analysis; minor irrelevant tangent on runny nose [P-16], but overall on-topic despite incompleteness."
