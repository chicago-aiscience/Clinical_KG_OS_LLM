  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly claims the patient 'did not provide a response' for all four questions (weight loss, travel, sick contacts, chemical exposure), directly contradicting the transcript [P-22: 'No, not really'; P-23: 'Went to Sarnia...'; P-24: 'Nope...'; P-34: engineering side, limited exposure]. DDx partially align (e.g., lung cancer/TB for weight loss, Legionella/TB for travel) but miss specifics like fungal infections, chemical pneumonitis, and exact narrowing effects (e.g., denial makes less likely but doesn't exclude). Adds non-transcript 'Symptoms Knowledge Graph'. Significant factual errors vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: DDx for each (lung ca/TB; endemic inf like Legionella/fungal; person-to-person/TB; chem pneumonitis/occ lung dz), cited responses, narrowing effects (less likely but not excluded; domestic/timing; reduces exposure; limited exp less likely), collective favor acute inf. Generated covers some DDx but misses all responses, all narrowing details, Sarnia context, and collective summary; adds irrelevant contrast factors. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims unverifiable/contradicted: 'no response' for each question despite explicit [P-22/23/24/34]; 'Symptoms Knowledge Graph' absent; hallucinates no narrowing due to no answers. Other citations (e.g., [P-4], [P-19]) accurate but irrelevant to queried questions. Largely fabricated on core responses.",
    "relevance": "Structures response around the four exact questions with DDx sections, addressing 'potential differential diagnoses'; attempts 'how responses help narrow' (though wrongly); minor tangents like extra summary contrasts and non-asked symptom narrowing."
