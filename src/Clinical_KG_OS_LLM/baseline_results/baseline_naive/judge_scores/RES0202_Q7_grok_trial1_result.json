  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the timeline: cough first appeared Wednesday night [P-1], worsened slightly on Thursday and further on Friday [P-1], fever emerged Friday over 100°F [P-1, P-2], fatigue ('really tired') emerged Thursday [P-1], decreased appetite Friday [P-15, P-17]. Minor discrepancy in not emphasizing ongoing 'significant fatigue' Friday [P-25 as in Gold], but no contradictions with transcript or Gold's core facts.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: Wed cough start [P-1], Thu cough worse + tired [P-1], Fri cough worse + fever [P-1,P-2] + dec appetite [P-15,P-17]; missed: mild runny nose Fri [P-16], significant fatigue Fri [P-25], stepwise summary [P-12], 3-day correction [P-4]. Covers ~85-90% of key evolution points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Wed/Thu/Fri details from [P-1], fever [P-1,P-2], appetite [P-15,P-17]; no hallucinations, accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured day-by-day addressing cough onset/severity changes, fever emergence, fatigue, and decreased appetite as specified in question; no off-topic content."
