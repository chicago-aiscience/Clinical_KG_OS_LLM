  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The diagnostic test is correct: a COVID-19 swab (“we’ll be ordering a covid swab no matter what” [D-53]). However, the rationale is partially misstated. The transcript’s explicit reason for prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza is the likely transmissible/household pattern (“if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out” [D-53]) and the need to isolate while ruling it out. The Generated Answer instead frames the priority mainly as due to the symptom pattern of fever/sore throat, which is a weaker/less specific rationale than what the doctor emphasized.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) COVID swab test ordered; (2) COVID prioritized before influenza in general terms. Misses key Gold elements: (a) husband with similar symptoms as the stated reason COVID is first to rule out; (b) self-isolation instruction and its connection to transmissibility/containment; (c) influenza discussed after COVID rule-out framing and after learning no flu shot. Overall, it captures the test but only part of the rationale.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in [D-53]/[D-54] (COVID swab ordered; infectious etiologies considered; flu mentioned as possible). The main issue is emphasis: it attributes the prioritization chiefly to fever/sore throat rather than the explicitly stated household transmission logic. That’s a mild-to-moderate distortion but not a complete fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (test ordered and rationale for prioritizing COVID vs influenza) without substantial off-topic content."
