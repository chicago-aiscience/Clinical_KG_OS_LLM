  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the two proposed diagnostic procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) with correct citations [D-37, D-39], matching the Gold Answer. The rationale for the COVID swab is precisely captured as protocol for 'anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately' [D-39], consistent with Gold. Minor paraphrasing of X-ray purpose ('better look at what is happening inside the body') combines [D-37] and [D-39] accurately without errors. No factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: confirmation of no medications/history (premise/partial), chest X-ray proposal by supervising physician with explanation [D-37,D-39], COVID swab with protocol rationale [D-39], discomfort/reassurance/arrangement/plan [D-39,D-40]. Generated covers both procedures and exact swab rationale fully; misses no meds/history confirmation, full X-ray explanation ('picture inside'), supervising physician distinction, discomfort/reassurance, and plan details. Covers core question elements (procedures + swab rationale) at ~80-90%, minor details omitted.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly grounded in transcript: X-ray from [D-37/D-39], swab and rationale from [D-39] with accurate quotes/paraphrases. No unverifiable or hallucinated content; citations precise.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing proposed procedures (chest X-ray, COVID swab) and providing specific rationale for COVID swab; no off-topic content."
