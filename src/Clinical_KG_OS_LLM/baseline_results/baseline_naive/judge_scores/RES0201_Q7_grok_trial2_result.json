  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: it completely omits the difficulty breathing symptom (a key symptom starting Day 4, worsening and constant per [P-8,P-9,P-10]), misrepresents smell loss as 'loss of smell (\"not really\")' when patient explicitly said 'not smell' meaning no issue [P-19], incorrectly places fatigue/muscle aches as 'new, current' instead of 'immediately after sore throat' [P-26], and vaguely groups taste changes under 'current status' without specifying Day 3 onset [P-20]. Sore throat onset and worsening are mostly correct, but swallowing issues are misplaced to Days 2-3 instead of initial. Score: 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: sore throat Day 1 worsening to affect swallowing [P-2,P-4]; fatigue/muscle aches shortly after Day 1 [P-25,P-26]; reduced taste Day 3 constant/new [P-19,P-20,P-21,P-22]; breathing Day 4 constant/worsening/new [P-8,P-9,P-10,P-11]; failed treatments [P-6]; progressive worsening. Generated covers sore throat (onset, worsening, swallowing partially), fatigue/muscle aches (but wrong timing), taste (but wrong smell and timing), treatments; completely misses breathing (major symptom), no clear day-by-day chronology or severity trajectories for all. Covers ~30-40% of key points. Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly cite transcript but with errors: misquotes P-19 on smell (hallucinates minor loss), places swallowing as later progression (P-2 is initial), no mention of prominent breathing discussion despite clear transcript evidence, introduces 'knowledge graph' not in transcript (hallucination), vague timelines not fully verifiable. Multiple unverifiable/misrepresented details. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly attempts chronological symptom order and severity changes starting from sore throat, structured by time periods, but incomplete (misses key symptom) and with tangents (knowledge graph). Mostly relevant with some off-topic elements. Score: 4"
