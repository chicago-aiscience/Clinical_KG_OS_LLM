  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly identifies fatigue and sleep disturbance as the constitutional symptoms the doctor screened for that the patient denied. In fact, the patient AFFIRMED these symptoms. The Gold Answer correctly identifies that the doctor screened for night sweats, unexplained weight loss, and hemoptysis - all of which were DENIED. The Generated Answer also incorrectly focuses on eczema as an exposure risk, when the Gold Answer clearly identifies the relevant exposure screening included sick contacts, travel history, and IV drug use. The Generated Answer fundamentally misunderstands what was denied versus affirmed.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: night sweats denial, weight loss/loose-fitting clothes denial, hemoptysis denial, sick contacts screening (pole dancing class, recent contacts, roommate), travel history screening, IV drug use screening, cocaine/heroin use screening, stiff neck screening, and nausea/vomiting screening. It only tangentially addresses the exclusion of TB and chronic infections without properly linking them to the specific denied constitutional symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple errors in interpreting the transcript. It claims fatigue and sleep disturbance were 'denied' when they were actually reported by the patient in P-19. It mischaracterizes eczema as an 'exposure risk' when it's simply past medical history. The answer fails to accurately cite the key screening questions from D-5 through D-8, D-10, D-14, D-15, D-32, D-33, D-39, and D-40 that are central to the question.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely off-topic. The question specifically asks for constitutional symptoms and exposure risks that were DENIED, but the answer discusses symptoms that were AFFIRMED. It also focuses on eczema (irrelevant to the exposure screening question) rather than the relevant exposure risks like travel, sick contacts, and substance use. While it mentions TB and chronic infections at the end, it fails to connect them properly to the screening questions asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misinterprets the question by reporting affirmed symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance) instead of denied constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis). It incorrectly identifies eczema as an exposure risk and completely omits the extensive exposure screening documented in the Gold Answer (sick contacts, travel, substance use). The answer demonstrates poor comprehension of both the transcript and the clinical question, covering less than 20% of required content with significant factual errors throughout."
