  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that there are no documented negative findings for fever, dyspnea, or sore throat in the transcript. However, the transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about these symptoms and the patient denying them: Fever (D-10/P-10), Difficulty breathing/dyspnea (D-11/P-11), and Sore throat (D-13/P-13).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to list any of the negative findings required by the prompt. It misses 100% of the key points identified in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of headaches, chills, night sweats, muscle aches, chest pain, and sputum production.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a false claim about the source text, stating it does not include the patient's answers to these questions. This is a direct contradiction of the provided transcript, constituting a hallucination of the text's limitations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the prompt because it incorrectly asserts that the requested information is not present in the source, thus providing no relevant details on negative findings or their clinical significance."
