  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists Tylenol, Advil, and Alka-Seltzer as OTC medications tried for chest pain with correct citation [P-6] and states ineffectiveness matching the Gold Answer and transcript quote; multivitamin as regular supplement is correct [P-25]; running as routine activity aligns with Gold's inclusion of stress management [P-28], with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: three OTC meds for pain (100%), ineffectiveness (100%), multivitamin as only regular supplement (100%), partial stress management via running (omits reading and nervousness to run lately); missed: explicit no prescription medications [D-25,P-25], full stress management details, quitting smoking efforts [P-13,P-14,P-18]. Covers approximately 80-90% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: pain meds and ineffectiveness [P-6], multivitamin [P-25], running routine [P-28]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around OTC meds for pain, their effectiveness, and routine supplements/activity, with no off-topic content."
