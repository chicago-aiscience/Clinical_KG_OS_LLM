  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all items asked in the question: (1) condition to rule out = COVID-19, (2) test = swab, (3) turnaround time = 24–48 hours, and (4) alternative diagnosis if negative = another viral illness. No contradictions or factual errors are present.",
    "completeness": "For the question’s required elements, the Generated Answer includes all key points found in the Gold Answer: COVID-19 as the primary rule-out, swab testing, 24–48 hour turnaround, and consideration of another viral illness if negative. The Gold Answer also mentions isolation, contact tracing, and supportive care, but these are not asked for in the question; omission does not reduce completeness for the queried items.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript at [D-52] (rule out COVID, take a swab, results in 24–48 hours, consider another viral illness if not COVID). No hallucinated or unsupported claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what the question asks (rule-out condition, test + turnaround time, alternative diagnosis if negative) with no tangential content."
