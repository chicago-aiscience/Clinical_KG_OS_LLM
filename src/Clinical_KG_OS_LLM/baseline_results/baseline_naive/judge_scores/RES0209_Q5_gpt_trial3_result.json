  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors relative to the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states that the exercise/cold air/pollen triggers are “absent from the provided transcript,” but the transcript explicitly documents these triggers (P-9, P-11). It also incorrectly claims there is no transcript evidence of clinician suspicion of undiagnosed allergies; in fact, pollen in spring leads the clinician to ask “so you have allergies too?” (D-12) and the patient reports suspected but undiagnosed allergies (P-12), with clinician affirmation (D-13). Some elements are correct (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheeze; asthma diagnosis at 8; sister with asthma), but the core question-related claims are wrong.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: current symptoms/exacerbation and increased bronchodilator use in general; patient diagnosed at 8; sister has asthma. Key points missed or contradicted: all three identified triggers (exercise, cold air/winter, spring pollen); explicit clinician linkage to allergies (D-12/D-13) and patient’s “not formally diagnosed” (P-12); the ‘no other triggers’ response (P-10); the family denial of other allergies/breathing problems (P-33/P-34); the specific escalation of rescue inhaler use from once every two weeks to 5–6 times/week (P-8); clinician suggestion that medication changes are needed for better control (D-43). Overall coverage is well under full and misses the central trigger/allergy linkage.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded or are directly contradicted by the transcript: claims that trigger information is absent; claims that clinician did not suspect allergies; repeated references to a “knowledge graph,” and tags like [SYMPTOM]/[TREATMENT] which are not in the transcript. While some symptom descriptions are transcript-supported, the answer includes several hallucinated/unsupported elements and misrepresents key transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The response is only partially aligned with the question. Instead of explaining how the triggers and family history relate to the current exacerbation and allergy suspicion, it largely deflects by claiming the trigger information is absent, then discusses general symptoms and family history without connecting the documented triggers and the clinician’s allergy questioning. This substantially undermines direct usefulness for the asked prompt."
