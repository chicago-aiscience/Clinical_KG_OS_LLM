  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the patient's 20-year smoking history and sick contact exposure are not in the text. Both are explicitly mentioned in P-40 ('I smoked 1/2 pack a day for probably 20 years') and P-20 ('one of them was a bit sick... maybe sometimes we walk a little too close'). The Gold Answer correctly identifies these facts, whereas the Generated Answer fails to recognize their presence in the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to address the smoking history's relation to COPD and fails to trace the specific chain of events starting from the dog walks/sick friend. It only provides a generic mechanism for an exacerbation based on symptoms like sputum and shortness of breath.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a lack of information, claiming details are missing when they are clearly present in the provided transcript. It also introduces 'Knowledge Graph' terminology and structural relationships that are not found in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the primary components of the question (smoking history and sick contact) because it incorrectly assumes the information is missing. While it discusses the exacerbation, it ignores the specific causal links requested by the user."
