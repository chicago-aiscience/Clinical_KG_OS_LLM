  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness at the bite site behind left knee), but completely fails on systemic symptoms. It claims there's no evidence the doctor screened for fever, joint pain, or headaches, when the transcript clearly shows: D-7 asks about joint pain (P-7 denies), D-8 asks about fever/feeling ill (P-8 denies), and D-19/D-20 asks about headaches (P-19/P-20 denies). The bizarre mention of 'drug allergies' as systemic symptoms screened for is completely wrong and conflates D-17 (about allergies) with the actual symptom screening.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only about 40% of required content. It partially describes local symptoms but misses key details like 'stuck pretty good,' the lack of bullseye rash, and 'totally fine' statement. Most critically, it fails to identify any of the three systemic symptoms that were screened for (fever, joint pain, headaches), which constitute a major portion of what the question asks for.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major hallucination. It fabricates the claim that the doctor screened for 'drug allergies' as systemic symptoms and incorrectly references [P-7], [P-8], [P-19] as responses about allergies when these are actually responses about joint pain, fever, and headaches. The statement that there's 'no explicit evidence' of screening for these symptoms directly contradicts the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address both parts of the question (local and systemic symptoms) but provides incorrect information for the systemic symptoms portion. The drug allergy discussion is completely irrelevant to the question asked. About 50% of the content is on-topic while the other half is either missing or incorrectly focused."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies some local symptoms at the tick bite site but contains a critical error in the systemic symptoms section. It falsely claims there is no evidence the doctor screened for fever, joint pain, and headaches, when the transcript clearly documents all three screenings and the patient's denials. The bizarre substitution of 'drug allergies' as a systemic symptom represents a significant hallucination and demonstrates poor comprehension of the source material."
