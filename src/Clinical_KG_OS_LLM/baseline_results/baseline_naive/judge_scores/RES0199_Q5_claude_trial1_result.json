  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor systematically asked about living situation [D-45, P-45], environmental triggers [D-46, P-46], contact with sick individuals [D-47, P-47], workplace [D-48, P-48, D-50, P-50], and travel history [D-49, P-49]. The Generated Answer claims these questions were NOT asked, which directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) living situation details (apartment, alone), (2) environmental trigger screening (carpets, mold, pets, etc.), (3) sick contact inquiry (lunch room exposure), (4) workplace details (car dealership), (5) travel history screening, and (6) substance use screening. The Generated Answer provides 0% coverage of the required content.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination. It claims the doctor 'did not systematically explore' exposure sources, which is directly contradicted by the transcript. The transcript shows explicit questions about living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48, D-50], and travel [D-49]. The Generated Answer fabricates a false narrative that contradicts verifiable transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's topic (exposure source exploration) but provides the opposite of what actually occurred. It focuses on what the doctor allegedly did NOT do, rather than documenting what was actually explored. This makes it highly misleading despite being topically relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely flawed, earning an average score of 1.25/5. It contains a fundamental factual error by claiming the doctor did NOT systematically explore exposure sources, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor asked about living situation, environmental triggers, sick contacts, workplace, and travel history. This represents both a major correctness failure (contradicting the Gold Answer) and a hallucination (contradicting the source transcript). The answer provides 0% coverage of the key points and, while topically relevant, delivers misleading information that is the opposite of reality."
