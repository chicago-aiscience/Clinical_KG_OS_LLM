  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient’s exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), the clinician’s estimate that attachment could be >72 hours, and the patient’s prior tick bite with a target/bullseye rash treated with antibiotics. It does not introduce major factual errors, but it over-weights “prior history” as a primary trigger for prophylaxis and omits the clinician’s explicit geographic-risk reasoning (Ontario risk map/Strathroy) that also contributed to the decision.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) exposure history (hiking/gardening, uncertain timing), (2) estimated attachment duration >72 hours, (3) prior history of tick bite with bullseye rash/antibiotics, and (4) acknowledgement that current tick didn’t resemble deer tick and no current bullseye rash.\nKey Gold Answer elements missed: (a) the geographic risk assessment (Strathroy along the creek; doctor referencing Ontario Lyme distribution map and calling it “close enough…concerning”), (b) the contextual risk perception that “all ticks in this area” may carry Lyme, and (c) the plan to send the tick to a lab and the “safer than not” rationale. Because a major asked-for component (geography) is absent, overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript. Minor issues: the phrase “based on the transcript and knowledge graph” is not grounded in the transcript, and the causal framing (“this combination…triggered the decision”) is a bit stronger than what is explicitly stated (the doctor also cited geographic risk). Overall, there are no major hallucinated clinical details.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on why prophylactic antibiotics were recommended and references the key risk factors it includes. However, it fails to address the geographic risk component explicitly, which is central to the question’s requested combination."
