  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy/runny nose) and the discharge character (mostly clear). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the denied symptoms; the patient explicitly denied cough, post-nasal drip, sore throat, and loss of taste/smell in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first two parts of the question but fails significantly on the third part, omitting all the denied respiratory symptoms requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer claims that the patient did not explicitly deny the listed symptoms, which is directly contradicted by the transcript (P-4, P-6, P-7, P-16).",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address the question directly, though the content provided in the final section is incorrect."
