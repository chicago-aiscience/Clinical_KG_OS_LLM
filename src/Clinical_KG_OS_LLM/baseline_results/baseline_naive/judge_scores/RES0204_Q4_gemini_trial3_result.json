  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies 'Asthma' as the condition. However, it incorrectly asserts that the transcript does not contain the specific clinical findings cited by the mother or details regarding physical activity. These details are explicitly present in turn [P-28].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to include the specific symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing) and the context of physical activity mentioned in the Gold Answer. It misses approximately 60-70% of the required information from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on faithfulness by claiming the requested information is absent from the source transcript. Turn [P-28] provides exactly what the question asks for (shortness of breath, wheezing, and physical activity), making the Generated Answer's claim of 'not present' a failure of grounding.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it addresses the first half of the question (identifying the condition) but fails to provide the requested clinical findings, instead offering a meta-commentary about the perceived absence of data."
