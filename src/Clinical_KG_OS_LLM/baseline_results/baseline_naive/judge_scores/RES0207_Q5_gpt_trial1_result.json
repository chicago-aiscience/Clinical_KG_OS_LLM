  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies medication non-adherence as a contributor to the seizure (patient forgot their med [P-9]) and correctly names Keppra as the patient’s antiseizure medication [P-23]. However, it makes major factual errors by stating there are no hereditary risk factors and no family history information in the transcript. This directly contradicts [P-26], where the patient states epilepsy runs in the family and that their mother had epilepsy. It also adds an unsupported reference to a “Knowledge Graph” confirming Keppra treats epilepsy, which is not part of the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) hereditary predisposition—epilepsy runs in family; mother affected [P-26]; (2) medication-related trigger—missed Keppra dose due to disrupted routine [P-24]; (3) patient acknowledges missed dose likely precipitated seizure [P-9]; (4) seizures usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent [P-9]. Generated Answer includes only part of (2) and partially (3) (missed med) and mentions Keppra [P-23], but omits the disrupted-routine context [P-24], omits the ‘seizures are infrequent’ control point [P-9], and полностью misses/denies (1) and family-history linkage to diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not grounded in the transcript: it denies the presence of family history/hereditary risk despite explicit transcript evidence [P-26], and it references an external “Knowledge Graph” not provided. While the medication non-adherence claim is grounded in [P-9] and Keppra in [P-23], the answer includes multiple unfaithful/contradictory statements.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address hereditary and medication-related risk factors and the role of family history, so it is on-topic. However, it fails to answer the hereditary/family-history part correctly, which substantially reduces its practical relevance to the question."
