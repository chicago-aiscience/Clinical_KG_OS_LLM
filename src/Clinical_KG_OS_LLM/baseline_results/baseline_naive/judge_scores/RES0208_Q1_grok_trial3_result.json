  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is mostly factually accurate, with correct citations and descriptions matching the transcript for loss of taste, dry cough, muscle aches, feverish sensation, loss of appetite (though partial coverage), but has a minor discrepancy in headache description—claiming 'may be having more than usual' while transcript [P-11] states 'don't think I'm getting any more than usual'; the taste quote is slightly garbled but intent matches; no major contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: loss of taste [P-4], dry cough details [P-8], muscle aches/achy [P-20], feverish/warm [P-4], decreased appetite [P-4]; partially covers headaches [P-11]; missed entirely: diminished smell [P-6] and its newness [P-5], sore throat [P-9], denial of runny nose/congestion [P-10], general weakness [P-2], full details on constitutional like wife's confirmation [P-4], usual stress headaches [P-12-13]; covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations; minor misinterpretation of headache frequency (P-11 says not more than usual, Generated implies possibly more); taste quote phrasing is awkward but matches transcript verbatim (double negative in original); added general malaise from [P-1] is grounded but overlaps excluded chief complaints; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by categorizing symptoms as specified (sensory, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional), directly quoting transcript, and excluding chief complaints of SOB/fatigue; minor addition of malaise is tangential but still relevant."
