  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the triad of symptoms: worsening cough, elevated temperature (fever), and change in taste. It accurately quotes the doctor's alignment in [D-44]. However, it misidentifies the parent as the 'father' (transcript [P-35] mentions 'me and my husband', suggesting the speaker is the mother) and uses an incorrect citation [P-15] to support the worsening cough, whereas [P-15] discusses appetite.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a key part of the 'how' in the doctor's reasoning. The Gold Answer highlights [D-45], where the doctor explains that the presence of fever specifically ruled out non-infectious causes like asthma. The Generated Answer only states that the symptoms were consistent with COVID-19 without explaining this differential logic.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is mostly grounded in the transcript. The use of 'allowed' instead of 'aligned' reflects a literal (though likely erroneous) reading of the transcript text. The identification of the parent as 'father' and the citation of [P-15] for the cough are minor hallucinations/errors.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the components of the question, including symptoms and the doctor's conclusion."
