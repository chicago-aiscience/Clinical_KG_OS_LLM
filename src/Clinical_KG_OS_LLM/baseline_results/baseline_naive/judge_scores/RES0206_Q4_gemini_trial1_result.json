  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19) and the test ordered (COVID swab), matching the Gold Answer and transcript. However, it contains a major factual error by stating that the transcript does not explicitly list details regarding the patient's recent social contacts. This directly contradicts the transcript where the patient mentions walking dogs with a friend who was 'a bit sick' (P-20).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers two out of the three main components of the question (the condition and the test). It fails to provide the specific detail about social contacts requested by the prompt, incorrectly asserting that this information is missing. It also misses the additional context provided in the Gold Answer regarding specific symptom screening (smell, taste, etc.).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript regarding the social contacts. It claims information is not present ('the transcript does not explicitly list details...') when it is explicitly stated in turn P-20. This is a 'negative hallucination' or a failure of grounding.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to answer all three parts of the specific question posed. It remains focused on the medical context of the dialogue."
