  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for high cholesterol. However, it incorrectly states that there is no mention of over-the-counter (OTC) medications. The Gold Answer and the transcript [P-14] explicitly mention Tylenol. While the transcript contains a likely typo ('I haven't taken some Tylenol... and that helps a little bit'), the Gold Answer interprets this as the patient taking the medication with partial effectiveness. The Generated Answer's flat denial of any OTC medication contradicts the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include the OTC medication (Tylenol), the reason for taking it (fever/unwell), and its reported effectiveness ('helps a little bit'). It only covers the prescription medication portion of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer follows a literal but contextually flawed interpretation of the transcript snippet [P-14]. While the transcript says 'haven't', the mention of 'Tylenol' and its 'help' are present in the text. By claiming there is 'no mention' of OTC medications, the Generated Answer ignores explicit evidence found in the transcript and recognized by the Gold Answer.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each part of the question (Prescribed vs OTC), even though it provides incorrect/incomplete information for the second half."
