  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the patient's hypertension management. It states that the transcript does not provide a specific reason for why she is not on antihypertensive medication, whereas the transcript (P-23) explicitly states she decided to try lifestyle modifications first. Additionally, it cites [P-1] for the frequency of inhaler use, but [P-1] describes her current symptoms; the frequency is actually mentioned in [P-26].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention lifestyle management strategies (weight loss, walking, smoking cessation, and alcohol reduction) which are crucial to the 'management strategies' part of the question. Most importantly, it fails to answer the 'why' regarding antihypertensive medication.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript by claiming information is missing when it is clearly present in P-23 ('I decided to try to change my lifestyle as much as I could 1st'). The citation of [P-1] for inhaler frequency is also inaccurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to address all parts of the question, but because it fails to provide the specific 'why' for the hypertension medication and omits the lifestyle strategies, it is only partially successful in its relevance."
