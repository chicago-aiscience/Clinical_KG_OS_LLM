  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Pneumonia/LRTI, consistent with the gold answer. However, it makes a significant factual error by stating that the transcript does not contain the word 'fever' or explicit evidence of it, whereas the doctor specifically asks about fevers in [D-4] and the patient confirms feeling 'hot at night' in [P-4]. It also omits the context of the underlying chronic cough mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the three requested clinical features but misses key nuances from the gold answer, such as the transition from a 3-month chronic cough to an acute episode, and the role of the doctor's summary in [D-47] to rule out other conditions.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucination of omission, claiming the transcript doesn't explicitly contain the word 'fever' or direct evidence for it. It then incorrectly attributes the 'subjective fever' evidence to the patient being 'tired' and having 'poor sleep' [P-19], ignoring the direct evidence in [P-4] where the patient says they have been 'feeling like hot at night.'",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is directly relevant to the prompt, following the structure of the question and addressing each point requested, despite the errors in evidence selection."
