  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold: COVID-19 ruled out via a COVID test that was negative; test done when symptoms first started (~2 weeks prior); workplace concerns included being a hospital clerk, PPE/IPC context, coworkers scared when coughing, staying home and wanting to return without coughing.\nGenerated: Correctly identifies COVID-19 as ruled out and that a COVID test was used. However, it incorrectly states the transcript does not specify when the test was performed relative to symptom onset; the patient explicitly says it was done “when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago” (P-36). Workplace concern is only partially captured (coworkers scared) and omits the hospital-worker context and return-to-work/staying-home concern emphasized in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) COVID-19 ruled out; (2) COVID test used; (3) coworkers scared at work when patient coughs.\nMissed: (1) explicit timing—test performed at symptom onset (~2 weeks before visit); (2) that the patient works at a hospital as a clerk and mentions PPE; (3) patient stayed home waiting to improve and is concerned about returning to work while still coughing; (4) the broader importance of exclusion in a hospital/IPC setting.\nOverall coverage is well under 80% of Gold’s key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Most points are grounded in the transcript (COVID test; coworkers scared). But it introduces an extraneous “Knowledge Graph” justification not present in the transcript and, more importantly, claims the transcript doesn’t specify timing, which directly contradicts P-36. This is a notable grounding error, though not extensive fabrication beyond that.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns) with minimal tangential material. The main problem is omission/incorrectness, not off-topic content."
