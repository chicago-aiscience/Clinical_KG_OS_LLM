  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer is largely inaccurate. It incorrectly identifies the screened/denied constitutional symptoms as “fatigue” and “sleep disturbance,” which were patient-reported (P-19) rather than doctor-screened-and-denied red-flag constitutional symptoms. It omits and therefore fails to report the key denied symptoms that were actually screened: night sweats (P-5), unexplained weight loss/loose clothes (P-6 to P-8), and hemoptysis (P-10). It also misclassifies eczema as an “exposure risk,” whereas it was simply past medical history. It further introduces an incorrect duration framing (“cough lasting for a month”) despite the transcript stating ~3 months (P-2, P-13). The serious conditions discussion is vague and does not match the Gold Answer’s linkage of the screening questions to TB and malignancy risk reduction (e.g., hemoptysis reducing concern for TB/lung cancer).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses most required elements from the Gold Answer:\n- Missed denied constitutional symptoms: night sweats, weight loss/loose-fitting clothes, hemoptysis.\n- Missed denied exposure risks: sick contacts (class, recent contacts, roommate), travel/exotic locales, cocaine/heroin use, IV drug use.\n- Missed other screened denials: stiff neck, nausea/vomiting, body pain.\n- Missed the explicit rationale that these questions help exclude pulmonary TB (and hemoptysis also relates to malignancy concern).\nIt includes only fatigue/sleep disturbance and eczema, which are not the key screened/denied items asked in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Some cited statements are grounded (patient tired/sleep disruption at P-19; eczema at P-22/23), but the answer is not faithful to the question or the transcript’s clinical screening: it claims the doctor “screened” for fatigue/sleep disturbance (not actually asked as screening questions), adds “knowledge graph” support that is not present, and inaccurately states the cough duration as “a month.” Major omissions of transcript-grounded screening items further reduce faithfulness to what occurred in the encounter.",
    "relevance": "Only partially addresses the question. It attempts to discuss constitutional symptoms/exposure risks and conditions to exclude, but it does not identify the specific denied screening items or exposure risks the doctor asked about, which is the core of the question. The included details (fatigue/sleep disturbance, eczema) are not the requested denied screening items and therefore are largely off-target."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely incorrect and incomplete, missing the key denied constitutional symptoms and exposure risks from the transcript and only loosely, and inaccurately, connecting them to exclusion of serious conditions like TB."
