  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly categorizes 'Acid Reflux' as a symptom of the two-week illness, whereas the transcript clarifies it is a chronic condition the patient manages with diet. It also labels 'Chest Pain' as a present symptom, while the transcript and Gold Answer specify that the patient denied chest pain but admitted to chest soreness resulting from the cough. It misses the specific characterization of the mucus as 'whitish clear'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is missing several key details found in the Gold Answer, including: specific mention of sore throat and runny nose (grouped vaguely as 'flu symptoms'), the frequency of the cough (3-4 times per hour), the spontaneous nature/lack of triggers, the stability of intensity/frequency, and the list of pertinent negatives (fever, breathing difficulty, nausea, etc.). It covers approximately 30-40% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is found within the transcript, and the citations are accurate to the speaker turns. There is no evidence of hallucination of facts outside the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant to the question, though including the chronic condition 'Acid Reflux' under symptoms of the two-week illness is a minor deviation from the specific focus of the prompt."
