  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies initial symptoms (headache and cough 4 days ago) matching Gold [P-1]. GI symptoms timed as 'few days back' ≈3 days into illness, which is a minor approximation (transcript has diarrhea 2 days ago [P-28], vomiting yesterday [P-32]); loss of smell 1 day ago exact [P-24]. Headache/cough stability described as 'persistent' and continued [P-3], but misses explicit 'stayed around the same' severity [P-9, P-11], a minor discrepancy as core stability is implied but not precisely stated. No major errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers: first symptoms (H+C 4 days ago), GI relative timing (approx 3 days in), loss of smell (1 day ago), H+C stability (persistent/continued). Misses: precise GI details (diarrhea 2 days ago, vomiting yesterday/nausea today), headache specifics (bilateral forehead/top, 7/10, atypical), dry cough, no worsening resp, pertinent negatives. Covers ~80-90% of key timeline and stability points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: H+C onset [P-1], GI 'few days back' [P-1], smell [P-24], persistent headache [P-3]. 'Approximately three days into' is plausible interpretation of 'few days back' from 4-day course; no fabrications or hallucinations, citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around onset/progression and symptom stability, perfectly addressing question's requirements on timeline, first symptoms, relative onsets of GI/smell, and H/cough changes with no off-topic content."
