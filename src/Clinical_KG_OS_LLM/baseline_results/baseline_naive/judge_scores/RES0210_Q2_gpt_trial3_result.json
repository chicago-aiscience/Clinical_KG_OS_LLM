  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists two medications: Lipitor (atorvastatin) for high cholesterol and OTC Tylenol (acetaminophen) for symptomatic relief (felt feverish/unwell), with Tylenol reported to “help a little bit.” Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for high cholesterol, but incorrectly states there were no OTC medications and therefore cannot assess OTC effectiveness—this directly contradicts transcript [P-14] and the Gold Answer. It also omits the reported partial efficacy of Tylenol.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points:\n- Lipitor for high cholesterol (covered).\n- Tylenol OTC used at home for symptom relief; “helps a little bit” (missed).\n- Non-medication relief: bringing up/clearing sputum helps temporarily (missed; though not a medication, it is included in Gold Answer context).\n- No other meds mentioned (partially implied but supported by incorrect claim of no OTC).\nOverall coverage is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that no OTC medications were mentioned is not grounded and is contradicted by [P-14] (Tylenol). The reference to a “knowledge graph” is extraneous and not part of the provided transcript, making that portion unverifiable. The Lipitor statements are grounded in [P-25–P-27]. Multiple elements are inaccurate/unverifiable.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address medications, indications, and OTC effectiveness (the asked items). However, it fails on the OTC portion due to the incorrect assertion that none were taken."
