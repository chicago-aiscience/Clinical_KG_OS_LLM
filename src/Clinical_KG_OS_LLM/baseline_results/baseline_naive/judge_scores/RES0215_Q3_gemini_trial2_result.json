  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma. However, it characterizes it as an 'acute exacerbation,' whereas the Gold Answer more precisely identifies 'exercise-induced bronchoconstriction' based on the specific triggers mentioned in the prompt. Most core facts align with the transcript, but the Gold Answer provides a more nuanced clinical diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers four out of the seven key supporting points mentioned in the Gold Answer (exercise triggers, cold weather, seasonal allergies, and multiple settings). It misses the critical diagnostic finding of reversibility with rest, as well as nocturnal symptoms and the importance of pertinent negatives (absence of fever/infection symptoms).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes several references to a 'Knowledge Graph' (e.g., '[KG]') and external clinical context not found within the provided source transcript. While the specific patient quotes are accurate, citing a non-existent Knowledge Graph constitutes a hallucination of the source material's structure and content.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question by providing a diagnosis and listing supporting evidence from the transcript as requested."
