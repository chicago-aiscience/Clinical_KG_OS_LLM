  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not explicitly mention chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, despite clear citations in the Gold Answer and transcript (e.g., [D-10/P-10] runny nose, [D-15/P-15] nausea, [D-16/P-16] chest pain, [D-17/P-17] palpitations). It falsely identifies cough as explicitly negated (patient said 'haven't really been coughing much' but acknowledged it might be starting [P-7/P-8]), and misinterprets sense of smell. Differentiation explanations are inaccurate, hallucinating a 'knowledge graph' and misattributing COVID-specific exclusions. Core facts contradict Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer lists 8 specific denied symptoms (runny nose/congestion, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling) with citations and detailed differentiation (excluding cardiac, GI, common cold, neuro causes). Generated Answer lists zero of these correctly, instead fabricating cough as negated and vaguely inferring absences; covers differentiation superficially but misses all key exclusions. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like 'transcript does not explicitly mention' chest pain etc. are false (directly in [D-16], etc.); cough negation misquoted ([P-8] is minimization, not denial); 'knowledge graph' hallucinated (absent from transcript); citations often wrong or twisted (e.g., [D-36] not about cough inquiry). Multiple hallucinated facts and unverifiable details make it largely ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "Attempts to address specific negated symptoms and differentiation but uses entirely wrong symptoms (cough instead of listed ones) and denies explicit transcript evidence, derailing into inferences and non-existent 'knowledge graph'; partially structured like question but content largely off-topic due to factual errors."
