{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated plan in the transcript and aligns with the Gold Answer’s main content: (1) auscultation of heart and lungs and a quick physical exam, and (2) consulting the supervising/working-with doctor, reviewing what was discussed, then returning to discuss next steps. No incorrect claims are introduced.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core plan elements from the Gold Answer: heart/lung listening, quick physical exam, then consult/review with the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps. It omits secondary Gold Answer points: that this plan was foreshadowed earlier in the encounter (D-1), that the patient agreed (P-37), and that no diagnosis/medication was provided and the transcript ends before findings/treatment. These omissions are minor relative to the question focus but are present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by D-37 (and are consistent with D-1). There are no hallucinated exam components, diagnoses, or treatments. Quoted phrases match the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on exactly what was asked: the end-of-consultation plan, specified exam components, and the process for determining next steps. No tangential content."
