  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. While it correctly identifies most respiratory and systemic symptoms, it incorrectly states that shortness of breath was identified as the most bothersome symptom. The Gold Answer clearly states the patient identified the cough as most bothersome [P-12]: 'the cough has been the thing that's been the most bothersome.' This is a critical error in answering the specific question about which symptom was most bothersome.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key respiratory symptoms (increased cough, increased sputum production, hemoptysis, dyspnea) and mentions fever. However, it misses several systemic symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: sinus pressure [P-12] and mild headache [P-14]. It also omits the specific detail about reduced exercise tolerance (difficulty walking dog) [P-4] and does not mention pertinent negatives. Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is largely grounded in the transcript with accurate citations for most symptoms. However, the claim that shortness of breath was the most bothersome symptom is directly contradicted by the transcript, where the patient explicitly states 'the cough has been the thing that's been the most bothersome' [P-12]. This represents a significant failure in faithfulness to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: it lists respiratory and systemic symptoms during the 3-day worsening and attempts to identify the most bothersome symptom. The structure is clear and focused. However, the incorrect identification of the most bothersome symptom means it fails to fully answer the question correctly, despite being relevant in structure."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies most respiratory symptoms (increased cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, dyspnea) and fever, with accurate citations. However, it contains a critical factual error by stating shortness of breath was the most bothersome symptom, when the transcript clearly shows the patient identified cough as most bothersome [P-12]. It also omits sinus pressure, headache, and reduced exercise tolerance details. The answer is relevant and structured appropriately but fails on the key question of identifying the most bothersome symptom."
