  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the reported nasal symptoms (stuffy and runny nose). However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain a description of the nasal discharge, whereas P-5 clearly states it is 'mostly clear'. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims there is no evidence of denied symptoms, whereas the transcript contains explicit denials for cough (P-4), post-nasal drip (P-6), sore throat (P-7), and loss of taste/smell (P-16).",
    "completeness": "The answer only provides information for the first part of the question (reported symptoms). It fails to provide the character of the discharge and the list of denied symptoms, claiming they are absent from the text. It misses more than 60% of the key points required by the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is not present in the source text when it is explicitly stated. It cites relevant paragraphs for the symptoms it found but fails to recognize clear responses in P-4, P-5, P-6, P-7, and P-16.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in its structure, addressing each sub-part of the question specifically, even though the content provided for the latter parts is factually incorrect regarding the source text."
