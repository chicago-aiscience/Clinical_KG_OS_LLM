  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies 'Chest tightness' and 'Other health problems' as the primary screens used to rule out an infectious cause. While these were discussed, the transcript (D-21 to D-28) contains a specific block of questions regarding fevers, travel, loss of taste/smell, and sick contacts that the doctor explicitly linked to screening for infection in D-29. The generated answer also includes asthma triggers (pollen, cold air) which are irrelevant to ruling out an infectious cause.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the screening for: recent colds, loss of taste/smell, fevers, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, sick contacts (home and outside), and travel history. It only correctly identifies the planned COVID-19 swab and the presence of a dry cough.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript (e.g., the patient does mention wheezing and triggers), but they are incorrectly applied to the specific question about 'infectious screening'.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely irrelevant to the specific prompt. Instead of focusing on the infectious/COVID-19 screening questions (the core of the query), it focuses on the patient's asthma symptoms and triggers. It only addresses the diagnostic test (COVID swab) correctly."
