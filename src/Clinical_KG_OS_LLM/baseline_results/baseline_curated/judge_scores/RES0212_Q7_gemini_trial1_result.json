  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies all four temporal milestones requested in the prompt: the 3-month onset, the 1-month mark for sleep disruption, the 3-day mark for productive/greenish sputum, and the 'past couple of days' for subjective fevers. These facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points found in the Gold Answer, including the specific durations and the patient's descriptions ('gunk', 'greenish', 'hot at night'). It misses the specific detail about the 'pole dancing class' mentioned in the Gold Answer for the initial onset, but satisfies the prompt's requirement to identify when it appeared.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are supported by the provided transcript. The citations (e.g., P-2, P-19, P-9, P-4) are accurate and correspond to the correct dialogue turns. There is a minor mention of a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context, but the information retrieved is entirely present in the transcript regardless.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, structured logically as a timeline, and directly answers each specific component of the multi-part question without adding extraneous information."
