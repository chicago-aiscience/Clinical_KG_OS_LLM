  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and omissions. It fails to capture that all three symptoms began simultaneously (confirmed in P-6), misses the explicit statement that the patient never experienced anything like this before (P-3), incorrectly references P-33 which is about alcohol consumption rather than symptom history, and omits critical details about symptom consistency (P-5, P-8) and the partial nature of sensory losses (P-4).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 50% of the key points. It mentions the two-day timeframe and simultaneous onset but completely misses: (1) explicit confirmation that cough started at same time (P-6), (2) clear statement of no prior similar episodes (P-3), (3) consistent non-fluctuating nature of all symptoms (P-5, P-8), (4) partial sensory loss details (P-4), and (5) the clinical significance noted by the doctor (D-39). The reference to P-33 about alcohol is completely irrelevant.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer shows poor grounding in the transcript. While the two-day timeframe is accurate, the reference to P-33 regarding previous symptom history is completely fabricated - P-33 discusses alcohol consumption, not symptom history. The answer fails to cite the actual relevant exchange (D-3/P-3) where the patient explicitly states 'no, nothing like this' about prior similar symptoms. The claim about 'no specific indication' of worsening contradicts explicit statements in P-5 and P-8.",
    "relevance": "The answer partially addresses the question but misses major components. It touches on timing but fails to adequately describe the simultaneous onset relationship, omits detailed information about consistency/fluctuation, and provides an incorrect and irrelevant citation for prior symptom history. The response is incomplete in addressing what the question specifically requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It contains factual errors (particularly the incorrect P-33 citation), misses critical information (simultaneous onset confirmation, explicit denial of prior episodes, symptom consistency details), and shows poor faithfulness to the source transcript by fabricating a citation and failing to reference key relevant exchanges. While it captures the basic two-day timeframe, it inadequately addresses the question's request for detailed temporal relationships, fluctuation patterns, and prior symptom history. The answer covers less than 50% of essential content from the Gold Answer."
