  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fully matches the Gold Answer's facts on the three OTC medications tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), their ineffectiveness ('hasn't really helped very much'), and the regular multivitamin supplement. Citations align perfectly, and there are no contradictions or errors relative to the Gold Answer, though it omits some contextual details like no prescription medications and non-medication stress/smoking info, which are not core discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: three OTC remedies for pain (100%), ineffectiveness (100%), regular multivitamin (100%). Partially covers implication of no prescription meds (lists only these). Misses additional non-med/supplement details (stress management via reading/running, quitting smoking), but these are supplementary and not central to the question on OTC meds/supplements; covers 90-95% effectively.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: Tylenol/Advil/Alka-Seltzer and ineffectiveness at [P-6], multivitamin at [P-25]. Direct quote accurate ('hasn't really helped very much' matches transcript). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; citations precise.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by categorizing OTC meds for pain, their effectiveness, and regular supplements with no off-topic content or tangents."
