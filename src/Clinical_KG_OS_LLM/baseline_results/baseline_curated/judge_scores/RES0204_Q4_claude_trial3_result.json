  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition ruled out and accurately cites the key clinical findings (shortness of breath and wheezing) absent even during physical activity. However, it contains a factual error: it states the family history was reported by the patient at [P-13], when actually [P-13] discusses fevers, and the family history is discussed at [P-28]. The core facts about asthma, symptoms, and physical activity are correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points: condition (asthma), family history (grandparents), clinical findings (no shortness of breath/wheezing even with physical activity), and prior workup. However, it misses several details from the Gold Answer: the specific dialogue flow ([D-28], [D-30]), the mother's definitive conclusion 'he doesn't have that,' the patient being 'pretty healthy otherwise' [P-24], and the distinction from chronic asthmatic patterns. Covers approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript. The asthma discussion, family history in grandparents, absence of shortness of breath and wheezing, and physical activity reference are all verifiable at [P-28]. However, the citation [P-13] for family history is incorrect - this passage discusses fevers, not respiratory family history. This is a citation error rather than hallucination, as the content itself is accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question: identifies the respiratory condition (asthma), notes it was ruled out despite positive family history (grandparents), and specifies the clinical findings absent even during physical activity (shortness of breath and wheezing). All content is relevant to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the ruled-out condition and accurately cites the key clinical findings. However, it contains a citation error (referencing [P-13] instead of [P-28] for family history) and misses some supporting details like the mother's definitive statement and the patient's overall health history. The response is highly relevant and mostly faithful to the transcript, with strong correctness despite the minor citation error."
