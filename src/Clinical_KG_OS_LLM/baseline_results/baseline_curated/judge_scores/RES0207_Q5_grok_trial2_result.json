  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: hereditary risk (mother's epilepsy [P-26]), medication non-adherence (missed Keppra [P-9, P-23]), and family history as predisposing to patient's epilepsy diagnosis. However, it introduces minor discrepancies by asserting 'directly causative' links via a 'knowledge graph,' which is not present in the Gold Answer or transcript, making causation more definitive than the Gold's 'likely precipitated' or 'preceded.' Core facts remain consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: hereditary risk (epilepsy in family, mom [P-26]), medication risk (forgot med [P-9], Keppra [P-23]), family history relation to diagnosis as causative/predisposing. Missed details: specific reason for missing dose (daughter's birthday celebration disrupting routine [P-24]), infrequent seizures when adherent and well-controlled [P-9]. Covers ~85% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Citations to transcript [P-9, P-23, P-26] are accurate and verifiable. However, multiple hallucinations: references to a non-existent 'knowledge graph' claiming 'directly causative' for missed dose and 'causal link' for family history; these claims are not in the transcript. Patient's statement is tentative ('might have'), not definitive. Some plausible inferences but undermined by fabricated external source.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question by structuring sections on medication-related risk, hereditary risk, and explicit relation of family history to diagnosis, with no off-topic content."
