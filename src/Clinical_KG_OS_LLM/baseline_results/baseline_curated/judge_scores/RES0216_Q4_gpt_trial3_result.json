  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as cardiac ischemia (“cardiac ischemic picture” in the transcript) and correctly notes the clinician’s rationale that symptoms were more “tightness” than “pain” and that this was less consistent with a classic exertional cardiac picture. However, it overstates the inference by claiming the findings “rule out” cardiac ischemia (the clinician only said it was “lower on the differential”), and it introduces an unsupported justification (“supported by the Knowledge Graph”).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) cardiac ischemic picture placed lower; (2) chest complaints characterized as tightness rather than pain; (3) some mention of not primarily being shortness of breath with exercise. Key points missed: (1) the specific screened/denied associated symptoms—anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom; (2) clearer inclusion of the clinician’s statement that the patient “didn’t really get out of breath with exercise”; (3) the idea that these were “cardiac red flags”/pertinent negatives contributing to lowering ischemia on the differential. Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (D-36, P-1, P-5). However, the statement about a “Knowledge Graph” is not present in the transcript, and the claim that the symptoms “rule out” cardiac ischemia is not supported (the transcript indicates only lower likelihood). These reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked items: which condition was lowered and what symptom findings (nature of chest complaint and absence of symptoms) were cited. It does not add major irrelevant tangents, though it incompletely lists the absent symptoms."

  "summary": "The answer identifies cardiac ischemia correctly and cites tightness without pain, but it omits several key pertinent negatives (anxiety/sweating/impending doom), adds an unsupported “Knowledge Graph” reference, and overstates exclusion by saying it “rules out” ischemia."
