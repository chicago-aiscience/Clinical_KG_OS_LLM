  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the assessment (symptoms in line with COVID-19), the tests (swab and x-ray), and the isolation protocols (until results are back, or longer if symptomatic).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points from the gold answer. It captures the assessment, both diagnostic tests, and both parts of the isolation instructions. It misses the detail that the doctor intended to consult with a supervisor ('the document I'm working with') to finalize the plan, which the gold answer includes as part of the management process.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, using accurate citations (e.g., [D-43]) for every claim made. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is perfectly relevant, addressing all three specific components of the user's multi-part question without any off-topic information."
