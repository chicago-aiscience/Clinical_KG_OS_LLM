  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer precisely details smoking (pack/day [P-37], started age 15 [P-38]), occupational mitigating factors ([P-34]), family history ([P-42]), and ties to mechanisms (mucociliary clearance, pneumonia, COPD, malignancy, hemoptysis). Generated covers core facts (pack/day [P-37], occupation [P-33], family [P-42]) but omits age 15 start, P-34 occupational safety/mitigation (instead amplifies risk), hemoptysis explicitly, and specific mechanisms like pneumonia/COPD; includes irrelevant cannabis [P-40]; interpretations partially contradict Gold on occupational risk. Some factual errors/omissions but main points align. Score: 3.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: smoking details (2 citations, mechanisms, relevance to cough/hemoptysis); full occupational details (2 citations, mitigation); family details; collective (infection likely, vigilance malignancy). Generated covers smoking pack/day, partial relation; occupation consultant/Sarnia only; family full; collective high-risk/malignancy vigilance. Misses age 15, P-34 details, hemoptysis, pneumonia/COPD/mucociliary, ~50-60% coverage. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims cite transcript accurately (e.g., [P-37], [P-33], [P-42], symptoms [P-1/15/17/18]); relations (smoking irritation, occupational irritants, family predisposition) plausible and grounded in general knowledge + transcript; minor stretch linking cannabis irrelevantly and assuming occupational exposure despite P-34 (but P-34 not contradicted directly); no major fabrications. Score: 4.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around the three exact risk factors from question, elicits specific details with citations, explains relations to presentation (cough, pain etc.), and collective risk; no tangents, perfectly on-topic. Score: 5."
