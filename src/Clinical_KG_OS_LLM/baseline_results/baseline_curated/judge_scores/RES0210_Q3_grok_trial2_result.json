  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures core facts like productive cough with yellow sputum and red spots, fever, exertional dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain, aligning with Gold Answer symptoms; however, it has minor discrepancies such as inaccurate fever citations (P-14 not directly fever evidence, misses precise P-8 timing), omits chills entirely, less detailed pain description (misses constant/dull/lying still aspects), and excludes smoking risk factor, but main diagnostic points remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: 1) yellow sputum/red spots (covered); 2) fever (partial, misses timing/details); 3) chills (missed); 4) exertional dyspnea specifics (covered); 5) detailed right-sided pleuritic pain (constant, dull, worsens cough/deep breath/lying - partially covered, misses some); 6) pleural involvement reasoning (covered); 7) smoking predisposition (missed). Covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: sputum [P-6], red spots [P-6], dyspnea [P-10], pain [P-17,P-18]; fever partially [P-5]; but [P-14] not fever evidence; major hallucination of 'Knowledge Graph' and its categorizations not present in transcript; some plausible interpretations like 'hemoptytic' but multiple unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists transcript findings supporting LRTI/pneumonia and explains pleuritic pain's diagnostic role with good structure; minor tangent with non-existent Knowledge Graph, but overall focused on question."
