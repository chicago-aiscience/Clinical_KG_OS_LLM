  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The stated immediate next steps (physical exam → talk to supervising physician → return to discuss next steps) are accurate and align with [D-58]. The environmental factor mentioned (carpets/new carpets) is also accurate per [P-54]. However, the answer frames its listed environmental factors as the set assessed, which is not fully accurate relative to the transcript (several other home exposures were assessed).",
    "completeness": "Included: (1) physical exam, (2) consultation with physician, (3) return to discuss next steps.\nMissing from Gold Answer: (a) explicitly noting no specific tests/imaging/medications were named, (b) the offer for parent questions before proceeding, (c) multiple home environmental factors assessed: household smoking, pets, wood-burning fireplace/stove, air-filter changes, and contextual exposure info (townhouse; who lives in the home). Overall coverage is well below 50% of key Gold Answer elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript ([D-58] for plan; [P-54] for carpets). No evidence of hallucinated tests, diagnoses, or environmental exposures.",
    "relevance": "The response addresses the question’s two required parts (plan and home environmental factors). It remains focused, but the environmental assessment portion is substantially underdeveloped compared with what was asked."
