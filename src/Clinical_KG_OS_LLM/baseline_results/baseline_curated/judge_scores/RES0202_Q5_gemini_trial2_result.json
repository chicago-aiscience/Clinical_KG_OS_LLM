{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the timeline of symptoms starting after school, the mother's suspicion of a school-based COVID-19 exposure, the lack of known sick contacts outside of school, and the uncertainty of contacts within the school.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary components of the question (school as the source, sick contacts, and school notification). However, it misses a few secondary details present in the gold answer: 1) The school's requirement for a COVID test to return so they can notify other families [P-41]. 2) The exclusionary evidence mentioned in the gold answer (no travel or home environmental issues) which strengthens the 'school' as the narrow source of infection.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript. There is a minor artifactual mention of a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context, but the clinical facts themselves are entirely faithful to the dialogue [P-1, P-2, P-38, P-39].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the multi-part question without adding extraneous clinical advice."
