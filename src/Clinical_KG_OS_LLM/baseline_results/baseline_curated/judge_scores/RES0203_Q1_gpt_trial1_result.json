  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the three symptom domains (smell change, taste change, cough) and notes smell as partial and cough as mild. However, it contains a major factual error: it labels taste loss as “complete,” whereas the transcript/gold clearly state taste was partial (patient could still taste very salty foods but not normal foods like banana). It also omits key accuracy elements about the cough being dry/non-productive and about the timing/consistency, which are part of the degree characterization requested.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: (1) decreased smell, (2) decreased taste, (3) cough described as mild. Key points missed: partial nature of taste loss and specific preserved/absent perceptions (salty foods vs banana/normal foods); smell specifics (can still smell very strong/bad odors); duration (2 days); symptoms being consistent over time; cough being dry and non-productive with no sputum/blood; cough starting at same time as sensory symptoms; no triggers identified. Overall, it captures only a minority of the requested detail about degree and what could/could not be perceived.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in [P-1], but the claim of “complete loss of taste” is not supported and contradicts the transcript ([P-4]) where the patient retains some taste (very salty). This is a substantive ungrounded inference.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked sensory and respiratory symptoms, but it does not answer the key part of the question (degree of each symptom and what the patient could/could not still perceive), limiting its usefulness."
