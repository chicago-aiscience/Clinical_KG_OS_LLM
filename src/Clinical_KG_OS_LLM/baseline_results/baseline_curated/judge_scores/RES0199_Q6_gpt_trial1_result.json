  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All included elements match the Gold Answer and are consistent with the transcript: COVID swab ordered, 14-day isolation, contact tracing only if positive, and supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). No statements contradict the Gold Answer. The answer does not introduce incorrect additional management.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key components (test type, isolation duration, trigger for contact tracing, and all supportive-care items). However, it omits two management details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the expected turnaround time for the swab result (24–48 hours) and (2) the doctor’s note that if not COVID it could be another viral illness going around. It also does not explicitly mention that no prescription medications were ordered (though it doesn’t claim any were).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made are grounded in [D-52]. The only mild concern is phrasing like “comprehensive supportive care plan,” which is a characterization, but the underlying recommendations are directly supported by the transcript. No hallucinated tests, treatments, or instructions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question’s requested components (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing condition, and supportive care). No irrelevant tangents."
