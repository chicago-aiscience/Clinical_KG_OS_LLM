  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (wheezing, cough, shortness of breath) and accurately notes that the cough was more recent. However, it states only 'wheezy breathing' was the earliest symptom, whereas the Gold Answer and transcript [P-2] specify both wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths as the earliest noticed.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several descriptive details included in the Gold Answer, such as the activity context (playing tag), the non-productive nature of the cough (no phlegm), the absence of cyanosis, and the child's overall appearance. It also omits 'difficulty taking deep breaths' from the specific list of earliest symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "All information in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript with accurate citations for the points it chose to include.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly answering both parts of the question without including extraneous information from other parts of the medical history."
