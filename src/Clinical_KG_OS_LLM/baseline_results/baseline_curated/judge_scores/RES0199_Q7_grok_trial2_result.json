  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details initial headache and cough 4 days ago (correct in Generated [P-1]); GI symptoms with precise timings (diarrhea 2 days ago [P-28], vomiting yesterday [P-32], nausea today); loss of smell 1 day ago (correct [P-24]); headache persistent, 7/10, stable severity [P-3,P-5,P-8,P-9]; cough dry and stable [P-11,P-12]. Generated correctly identifies timeline for initial symptoms, loss of smell, and GI as 'few days back' per [P-1], notes headache persistent and cough dry/remaining present, implying stability but omits explicit severity stability ('stayed around the same'), rating, and precise GI sub-timings. No contradictions, minor omissions/discrepancies in detail.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: initial headache/cough Day -4; headache details (persistent, location, 7/10, stable, atypical); cough dry/stable; GI ~Day -2 (diarrhea specifics), vomiting Day -1, nausea Day 0; anosmia Day -1; negatives. Generated covers: initial Day -4 (100%), GI timing 'few days' (partial, misses precision), anosmia Day -1 (100%), headache persistent/location (partial, misses severity/stable/atypical), cough dry/present (partial, misses explicit stable). Covers core timeline (~80%) but misses severity stability emphasis, precise GI, rating, negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "All Generated claims directly verifiable: initial symptoms [P-1], GI 'few days back' [P-1], anosmia [P-24], headache persistent/location [P-3,P-5], cough dry/remaining [P-11,P-12]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details; 'remained present/persistent' grounded in stability reports.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around question elements: initial onset, GI timing relative to initial, loss of smell timing, headache/cough progression/stability, with no off-topic content or tangents."
