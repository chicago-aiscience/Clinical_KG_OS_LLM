  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer aligns with Gold on core symptoms like increased dyspnea, cough, sputum production for COPD exacerbation and green-yellow sputum, fever, sick contact for infection; correctly notes doctor's dual assessment implicitly; minor discrepancies include placing purulent sputum primarily under COPD (Gold puts under infection), adding unmentioned 'acute onset aligns with incubation' and medical claims like 'COPD does not typically cause fever' (plausible but interpretive), and hallucinating 'knowledge graph'; no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: COPD symptoms (worsening dyspnea, cough, sputum volume [P-1], implied exercise tolerance); infection symptoms (fever [P-9], sick contact [P-20], sputum [P-1]); distinguishing role of sputum/fever; missed: sinus pressure [P-12], headache [P-14], patient history of illness-triggered exacerbations [P-3], excluded triggers (no exposures [P-38], inhaler adherence [P-26]), doctor's exact quote [D-43], lack of objective findings [D-43]; covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: symptoms and citations [P-1, P-9, P-20] match transcript; unverifiable/hallucinated: repeated 'knowledge graph' references (absent), 'incubation/progression typical of infection', 'green sputum indicates both per knowledge graph', 'COPD does not typically cause fever', 'infection moved into airways obstructing' (plausible interpretations but not directly from transcript); some added medical knowledge.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by listing symptoms supporting respiratory infection and COPD exacerbation separately, then explaining distinguishing role of fever (infection indicator) and green-yellow sputum (purulent infection triggering exacerbation); structured response with minimal off-topic content."
