  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are all accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript—no contradictions or errors in the symptoms mentioned (headaches [P-11], dry throat sensation and lack of coughing [P-8], body aches [P-20], weakness/run-down [P-1/P-2], loss of appetite [P-2]). Minor discrepancies include categorizing headaches as sensory (Gold places under constitutional), describing 'dry throat' for cough/sore throat area (close but not exact), and including run-down/weakness which borders on chief complaints but Gold attributes weakness to musculoskeletal.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: generalized muscle aches/body aches [P-20/P-21], mild headaches [P-11-13], partial upper respiratory (dry cough/lack of coughing [P-7/P-8], but misses explicit sore throat [P-9] and denial of runny nose [P-10]), loss of appetite [P-2/P-4], weakness [P-2]. Missed entirely: loss of taste [P-4/P-5], diminished smell [P-6], subjective fever [P-4]. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (P-1, P-2, P-8, P-11, P-20); no hallucinated facts or unverifiable details—fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the specified categories (sensory, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional) and excluding chief complaints, with no off-topic content."
