  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the management plan from [D-52], including the COVID swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and all listed supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, rest, Tylenol/NSAIDs for symptoms). Minor discrepancies include omitting the expected results timeframe ('24 to 48 hours') and the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness, but no factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic test (COVID swab, misses results time), 14-day self-isolation, contact tracing if positive, all supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleeping well, Tylenol for fevers if any, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Missed: results timeframe, explicit alternative diagnosis mention, and statement on no other prescriptions. Covers approximately 85% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations; no hallucinations or fabricated details, though 'anseads' is faithfully reproduced from the transcript (likely a transcription error for 'NSAIDs'). Minor rephrasing like 'solely in the event' is grounded in the conditional phrasing.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured and focused on the exact components requested in the question (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), with no off-topic content or tangents."
