  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out and a COVID swab as the ordered test, matching D-43. It accurately cites the social-contact prompt: walking dogs with friends, one of whom was sick, and sometimes walking “a little too close” despite being outdoors (P-20). No factual errors relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core elements emphasized in the Gold Answer that directly answer the question: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) order COVID swab, (3) sick friend during outdoor dog walks with close proximity. It omits additional contextual details included in the Gold Answer (e.g., patient unsure if the friend had a COVID test; the doctor’s additional COVID symptom/travel screening).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (D-43, P-20). No hallucinated or unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question (condition, test, and contact detail prompting consideration) without extraneous information."
