  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain, which is consistent with the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain'. All clinical observations cited (situational triggers, distraction, physical symptoms of nervousness, history of anxiety, current stressors, and patient suspicion) are factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 85% of the key points. It includes the situational triggers, the relief from distraction, the history of anxiety, current stressors (though it omits the specific detail of the 'Masters thesis deadline'), the physical manifestation of anxiety, and the patient's own suspicion. It misses the 'pertinent negatives' mentioned in the Gold Answer (no fever, no asthma, no exertional worsening), which are clinically relevant for ruling out other pathologies.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. Each observation is supported by specific patient quotes or paraphrases that can be directly mapped to the dialogue (e.g., P-29, P-19, P-20, P-13, P-8). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly relevant. it directly answers both parts of the question: the diagnosis and the specific clinical observations that support it."
