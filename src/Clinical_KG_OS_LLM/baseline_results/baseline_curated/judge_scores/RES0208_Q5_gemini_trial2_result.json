  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the connection between the grandson's cold/daycare and the suspected infection. However, it fails significantly on the second part of the question. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain evidence of exploration of travel or client visits, which is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about travel outside the province (D-24/P-24) and recent in-person client visits (D-32/P-32).",
    "completeness": "The answer only addresses the first half of the prompt correctly. It misses 100% of the key points regarding the specific exclusion of travel (no travel outside the province) and occupational exposure (no client visits in the last two weeks), which are central to the Gold Answer and the user's question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is missing from the source text when it is explicitly stated in lines [D-24], [P-24], [D-32], and [P-32]. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to address both parts of the prompt. However, the relevance is undermined by the incorrect claim that the requested information was not available."
