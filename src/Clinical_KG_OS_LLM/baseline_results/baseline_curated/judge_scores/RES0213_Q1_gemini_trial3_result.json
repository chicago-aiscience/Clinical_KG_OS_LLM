  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the quality of the pain as sharp and strong, the duration as 20 minutes, and the specific situational triggers (walking alone, studying) and resolutions (talking to others, manual tasks).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the key points requested in the prompt (quality, duration, triggers, resolution). However, compared to the Gold Answer, it misses several clinical details such as the 1.5-week duration of the condition, the patient's initial description of the sensation as 'odd' or 'uncomfortable', the fact that it occurs at rest, and negative findings like the lack of worsening with exercise or history of injury.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims, including the duration of episodes (P-6), the quality of pain (P-3), and the situational factors (P-29), are directly supported by the text. The inclusion of the father's heart attack as a source of worry is also supported by P-8.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on the characteristics, duration, and situational occurrences asked for in the question without introducing off-topic information."
