{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemia/ischemic picture) and the main symptom (tightness vs pain). It accurately reflects the doctor's reasoning in D-36 regarding the nature of the complaints and the absence of pain.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: specifically, the absence of associated symptoms like anxiety, sweating, and the feeling of impending doom which were explicitly screened in the transcript [D-6] and included in the Gold Answer. It also lacks the specific nuance regarding the patient's reported difficulty getting a full breath vs the doctor's interpretation of exercise-induced breathlessness.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph' at the end, which is not part of the source transcript. The claim that the 'absence of chest pain... rule out cardiac ischemia' is a medical overstatement not present in the text (the doctor said it puts it 'lower on the differential').",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's questions regarding the condition and the symptoms used to deprioritize it."
