  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the clinical information provided in both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the duration of the cough, the resolution of other symptoms, the specific dietary management of reflux, the presence of hay fever, and the occupational risk/PPE usage.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all three primary factors requested (acid reflux, hay fever, and occupational exposure) with similar clinical reasoning to the gold answer. However, it omits the additional context regarding the patient's anxiety and the social pressure from coworkers mentioned in the gold answer's conclusion, which provides further context for the clinical presentation and healthcare-seeking behavior.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. It includes accurate citations for every claim, such as the specific foods avoided for reflux [P-25], the use of PPE [P-17], and the timeline of flu-like symptoms [P-14]. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The response is entirely relevant to the question asked. It focuses specifically on the three components of the patient's history requested and links them logically to the persistent nature of the cough."
