  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all queried elements: the patient tried OTC decongestants, perceived they helped “a little bit,” and the doctor recommended an OTC product like Tylenol Cold. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "It includes the key items directly asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer (decongestants tried; partial/“a little bit” effectiveness; Tylenol Cold recommendation). It does not include additional supportive-care details included in the Gold Answer (hydration, expectation of a few weeks, limited role beyond supportive care).",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript: decongestants and \"worked a little bit\" are in [P-10], and Tylenol Cold is in [D-39]. No evident hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question (prior medication, perceived effectiveness, and the recommended OTC treatment) without unrelated content."
