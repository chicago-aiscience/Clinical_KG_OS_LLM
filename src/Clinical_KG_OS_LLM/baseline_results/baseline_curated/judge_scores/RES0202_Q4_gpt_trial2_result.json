  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies **asthma** as the condition the doctor would have added to the differential if the presentation were different, and correctly identifies **the presence of fever** as the key clinical finding that led the doctor to prioritize an infectious cause rather than asthma. However, it inaccurately attributes the key asthma/differential statement to **[D-44]** (it is actually in **[D-45]**) and adds an unsupported claim that a “knowledge graph” shows fever rules out asthma (not stated in the transcript and also clinically overstated).",
    "completeness": "It includes the two core elements required by the question: (1) asthma would have been added if cough/SOB without fever; (2) fever in this case led the doctor to not pursue asthma in the current workup. It does not include the Gold Answer’s additional supporting details (e.g., no wheeze [P-7], unclear SOB [P-8], nuance that asthma isn’t permanently ruled out), but those are supportive rather than strictly required for the asked question.",
    "faithfulness": "Most of the content is grounded in the transcript, but there are two faithfulness issues: (1) incorrect citation to **[D-44]** for the asthma statement (it appears in **[D-45]**); (2) the “knowledge graph” claim is not present in the provided source transcript and is an extraneous, unverifiable addition. These reduce grounding despite the main conclusion matching the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what condition would have been added and what finding excluded it from the current workup, with minimal extraneous discussion (aside from the unnecessary “knowledge graph” mention)."
