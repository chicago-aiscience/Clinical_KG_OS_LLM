  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports key symptoms present in the transcript: productive cough; sputum described as “yellow custard” with red spots; right-sided chest pain that worsens with deep breathing; systemic fever and chills; and throat rawness after coughing. These are consistent with the Gold Answer and the cited transcript lines. The only mild issue is that it labels the pain as “pleuritic” (an interpretation) rather than strictly describing it as worse with deep breath/cough, but this inference is supported by the transcript and does not contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core elements asked (sputum color/appearance; chest pain location and a quality feature; fever/chills) but misses several specific descriptors included in the Gold Answer: chest pain being constant/always there, dull, present even when lying down, and worse with coughing (not just deep breath); fever details (subjective, started Monday, not measured, persisting through visit); chills timing (“especially last two days”); and additional associated symptoms noted in Gold (mild dyspnea on exertion, resolved runny nose, and the pertinent negative of no weight loss). Overall coverage is partial rather than comprehensive.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by the transcript citations. The characterization of the pain as having a “pleuritic nature” is slightly interpretive but grounded in the patient’s report that deep breaths worsen pain. No clear hallucinated symptoms are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the symptoms requested (sputum, chest pain, systemic symptoms) with only minor inclusion of other relevant respiratory symptoms (cough, throat rawness). It does not drift into irrelevant history or management."
