  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript and Gold Answer: the patient takes only multivitamins (P-40), reports a penicillin allergy (P-37), and experiences a rash as the reaction (P-38). No incorrect or contradictory statements are present.",
    "completeness": "It includes the core elements requested and present in the Gold Answer (multivitamins only; penicillin allergy; rash). It does not include two supporting details included in the Gold Answer: (1) that she is not on prescription medications despite pre-diabetes/monitoring glucose (P-33), and (2) that she denies trouble breathing with the reaction (P-39).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the cited transcript lines (P-40, P-37, P-38). No hallucinated medications, allergies, or reactions were added.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question (current meds, allergy, and reaction) with no tangential content."
