  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the mother-reported respiratory symptoms at presentation: wheezing, slight cough, and shortness of breath/difficulty taking deep breaths (all supported by P-1 and P-2). It also correctly states that wheezing was the earliest symptom and that the cough appeared later (“and now she has a slight cough”), matching the Gold Answer’s timeline interpretation.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) wheeze present 4–5 days, (2) slight cough at presentation, (3) short of breath/difficulty taking deep breaths, (4) wheeze earliest and cough later.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: exertional “quite out of breath” with activity (P-3), “hard time catching her breath” during episodes and denial of cyanosis (P-32), non-productive cough/no phlegm (P-31), and the contextual note that she looked fine otherwise (P-9). Overall, it captures the core symptoms and onset but omits several supporting/qualifying respiratory details included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (P-1, P-2, P-43). It does not introduce new, non-evidenced symptoms or timeline claims beyond what is said/implied in the source.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question: it lists respiratory symptoms at presentation and specifies which were earliest at onset. No meaningful irrelevant content."
