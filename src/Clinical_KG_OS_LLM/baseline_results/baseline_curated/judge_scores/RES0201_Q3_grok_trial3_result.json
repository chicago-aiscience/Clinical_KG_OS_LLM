  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and transcript: it incorrectly states the patient has 'loss of smell' when the patient explicitly reports 'maybe taste a little bit but not smell' [P-19], flipping the key detail emphasized in the question and Gold Answer (reduced taste WITHOUT loss of smell); it claims the doctor explicitly linked 'sore throat and difficulty breathing' to COVID-19 symptoms, but [D-43] only says 'some of your symptoms'; it fabricates a 'Knowledge Graph' not present anywhere; it omits fatigue/muscle aches and exposure risks listed in Gold. Core facts like sore throat, dyspnea, and taste changes are mentioned but distorted, contradicting Gold's accurate summary.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: doctor's [D-43] statement; sore throat (4 days worsening [P-2,P-4]); dyspnea (new, worsening, constant [P-8-10]); reduced taste (2 days, persistent, no smell loss [P-19-21]); fatigue/myalgias ([P-25-26]); screening for taste/smell [D-19]; exposure risks [P-12-13]; up-to-date immunizations [P-14]. Generated covers sore throat, dyspnea, taste (but wrongly adds smell loss), doctor's statement partially; misses fatigue/myalgias entirely, timelines, exposure, screening details, immunizations. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Not grounded in transcript: hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' and its links; misquotes/interprets [P-19] as 'loss of smell' (patient says 'not smell'); falsely attributes specificity to doctor in [D-43] ('these specific symptoms'); no verification for clinical reasoning claims beyond transcript. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly attempts to address the question by listing symptoms leading to COVID suspicion and discussing taste/smell support, but derailed by factual errors and irrelevant 'Knowledge Graph'; minor off-topic fabrication but core focus matches question."
