  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key respiratory symptoms (increased cough frequency, increased green-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, worsened shortness of breath) matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-1]. It partially covers systemic symptoms by mentioning possible fever [P-9] but omits sinus pressure [P-12] and mild headache [P-14]. It misses reduced exercise tolerance [P-4]. Critically, it incorrectly states that shortness of breath was identified as the most bothersome symptom [P-1], contradicting the patient's explicit statement that 'the cough has been the thing that's been the most bothersome' [P-12]. This is a significant factual contradiction on a core question element.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: Respiratory (increased cough [P-1], sputum [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], dyspnea [P-1], exercise tolerance [P-4]) - covers 4/5. Systemic (fever [P-9/10/11], sinus pressure [P-12], headache [P-14]) - covers 1/3. Most bothersome: cough [P-12] - misses entirely (wrongly attributes SOB). Covers approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptom claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1 for respiratory, P-9 for fever]. No fabrication of symptoms. However, the claim that the patient 'identified shortness of breath (difficulty breathing) as the primary symptom' and 'most bothersome symptom' is not supported by the transcript; instead, [P-12] explicitly states cough is most bothersome. This introduces a hallucinated attribution, though plausible given symptom prominence.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured to address the question directly: lists respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, and most bothersome symptom with no off-topic content or tangents."
