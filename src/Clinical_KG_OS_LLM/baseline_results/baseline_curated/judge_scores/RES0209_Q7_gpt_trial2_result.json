  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly notes asthma diagnosis at age 8 and describes current symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, near-nonstop daytime cough), which aligns with the transcript. However, it omits and/or misstates key aspects of the bronchodilator-use trajectory: it does not report the baseline use of “once every two weeks” (P-8) nor the current quantified escalation to “almost everyday… five six times a week” (P-8). It also incorrectly frames “nighttime symptoms… every other day” as implying near-daily bronchodilator use (the transcript states nighttime symptoms frequency, not inhaler frequency), and it incorrectly suggests a baseline description of nighttime symptoms using P-18 (P-18 refers to current symptoms). These issues reduce factual accuracy compared with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: diagnosis at age 8; some triggers (exercise, cold air/pollen); major current symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheeze, near-constant cough); presence of nighttime symptoms.\nMissed key Gold Answer points: patient is now 10 (2-year history); baseline bronchodilator frequency “once every two weeks”; current bronchodilator frequency “5–6 times per week”; timing clarification that symptoms have been present for the last two weeks (vs initial “past week or so”); chest tightness; bronchodilator used only when very difficult to breathe and wheezing occurs more often than bronchodilator use; denial of infectious/travel/COVID-like precipitants. Overall, it captures well under half of the requested evolution details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most symptom statements and triggers are supported by the transcript. However, it introduces unsupported interpretations/claims: that nighttime symptoms indicate near-daily bronchodilator use, and that there is a baseline nighttime-symptom pattern derived from P-18 (which is about current symptoms). Mention of a “knowledge graph provided” is also not grounded in the transcript. These make the response only partially grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (asthma symptom course and medication use over time), but it fails to directly address the question’s key comparison points—especially the baseline once-every-two-weeks use and the current 5–6 times/week near-daily use—so it only partially answers what was asked."
