  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly links Jessica’s dry cough, scratchy throat, subjective fever/feeling hot, and headache to a likely URI and appropriately notes that a non-productive cough can suggest upper-airway irritation rather than a productive lower respiratory infection. However, it overstates that “dry cough and fever” are “sufficient” for the diagnosis (Gold emphasizes a constellation and timeline rather than sufficiency), and it inaccurately references [D-58] as the place where the doctor asks about “bringing anything up” (the detailed sputum denial is earlier at [D-5]–[P-6]). These issues weaken factual precision relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: dry cough, scratchy throat, subjective fever/feeling hot, headache; absence of sputum and GI symptoms and joint pain as supporting features.\nKey Gold points missed or underdeveloped: the typical 3–4 day URI timeline as a supporting element; explicit inclusion of malaise (and that the clinician labeled it as such); fatigue; household exposure (brother had a cold); and the closing point that the doctor summarized and framed next steps accordingly. Overall this is partial coverage (~50–70%) of Gold elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: the repeated reliance on a “knowledge graph” (not provided in the source materials) and the claim that it “explicitly defines” indicators. Also, the citation/wording around sputum is misleading: [D-58] is a summary, not where the doctor asks the question; the transcript evidence for no sputum is [D-5]–[P-6]. The rest of the symptom descriptions are generally supported by cited lines. Due to the invented ‘knowledge graph’ framework and citation inaccuracies, faithfulness is substantially reduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on explaining how the presence of URI-like symptoms plus absence of sputum/GI/joint symptoms supports the URI assessment. The “knowledge graph” section is a minor tangent but still tied to diagnosis. Overall it addresses the question directly with minimal irrelevant content."
