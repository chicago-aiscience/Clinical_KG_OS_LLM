  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately reflects the main plan in the Gold Answer: COVID swab ordered with 24–48h turnaround, 14-day isolation, possibility of false negatives, alternative of another viral illness if negative, and ER red flags (high temperature, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, fainting). Minor inaccuracy/overstatement: it says the fever “ruled out” asthma; the transcript/Gold Answer says asthma would be added to the differential only if cough/SOB occurred without fever—fever makes infection more likely, but asthma is not explicitly “ruled out.”",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points: test + turnaround, isolation duration, false negatives, alternative viral illness, and ER warning signs with examples.\nMisses/understates: (1) isolation was specified to include separating from the younger sister if possible; (2) the explicit “watchful waiting/no medications prescribed” aspect is not stated; (3) the conditional framing about asthma (only if cough/SOB without fever) is present but phrased less precisely.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all claims are directly supported by [D-44] and [D-45]. The only mild ungrounded element is the stronger phrasing that fever “ruled out” asthma, which is an inference beyond the doctor’s wording. The mention of a “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript but does not change clinical content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question components (assessment, test + turnaround, isolation, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negatives, and ER warning signs with examples) with no substantive tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly consistent and relevant, capturing most elements of the doctor’s assessment/plan, with minor omissions (isolation from sister; watchful waiting/no meds) and a slight overstatement regarding asthma being “ruled out.”"
