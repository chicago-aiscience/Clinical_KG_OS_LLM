{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with both the transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness), the patient's history (diagnosed at eight), and the triggers (cold air, exercise, pollen).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a critical component of the Gold Answer: the exclusion of other respiratory conditions. The Gold Answer explicitly mentions the clinician's screening for infectious etiologies (denying fever, sick contacts, travel, loss of taste/smell, etc.) which is vital to answering why it is NOT a new respiratory condition. It also omits the specific frequency metrics mentioned in the prompt and Gold Answer (once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week).",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript. Citations like [P-1], [P-15], and [P-11] are accurate and correctly linked to the patient's statements.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question of why the symptoms point to worsening asthma. However, it focuses primarily on confirming asthma and lacks the 'differential' logic (ruling out alternatives) requested by the 'rather than a new respiratory condition' part of the prompt."
