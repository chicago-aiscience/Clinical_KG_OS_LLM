  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main GI (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and respiratory (cough) symptoms, accurately describes the cough as mostly dry [P-12], and notes two vomiting episodes [P-32], matching Gold. However, it erroneously states the transcript 'does not provide a specific frequency' for diarrhea despite [P-28] ('five or six times a day') and Gold including it. For headache severity, it cites persistence [P-3] and feeling 'really sick' [P-1] instead of the 7/10 rating [P-8] specified in Gold and question. Omits timelines (e.g., cough/diarrhea/headache starts), diarrhea nature (liquid), vomiting details (food contents), and negatives. Significant factual errors and omissions vs. Gold. Score: 2",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: cough (dry, 4 days ago [P-1,P-12], stable [P-11], no sputum/blood [P-13], negatives SOB [P-14], wheezing [P-15], chest pain [P-16]); diarrhea (2 days ago [P-28], liquid stools, 5-6x/day [P-28], no blood [P-29]); nausea (today), vomiting (yesterday, 2x [P-32], food contents [P-34], no blood [P-33]); GI negatives (no bloating/gas [P-36], constipation [P-37], appetite change [P-31]); headache (4 days [P-1], persistent/bilateral forehead/top [P-3,P-5], 7/10 [P-8], no radiation [P-6]/stiffness [P-7], unusual [P-10]); extras (smell loss [P-24], fatigue [P-19]). Generated covers symptom lists, cough nature (partial), vomiting number; misses diarrhea freq/nature/timing, headache severity/location/timing, all negatives, extras, cough details beyond nature. Covers 20-49% of key points. Score: 2",
    "faithfulness": "All stated symptom claims (dry cough [P-12], 2 vomits [P-32], persistent headache [P-3], sick [P-1]) verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, claim of no specific diarrhea frequency contradicts [P-28] ('five or six times a day'), representing a misreading/hallucinated absence. No other ungrounded patient facts or inaccurate citations. Some inaccurate claims. Score: 3",
    "relevance": "Structured response lists GI/respiratory symptoms then specifically addresses requested characteristics (cough nature, diarrhea frequency, vomiting number, headache severity), directly matching question without extraneous content. Score: 5"
