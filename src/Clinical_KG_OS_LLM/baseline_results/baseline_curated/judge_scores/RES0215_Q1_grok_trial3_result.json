  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the main respiratory symptoms (wheezing, cough, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing) reported at presentation and correctly notes wheezing as the earliest symptom with cough being more recent, matching the Gold Answer's core facts from P-1 and P-2; minor discrepancies include not explicitly separating 'difficulty taking deep breaths' as a distinct earliest symptom, omitting details like non-productive cough (P-31), no cyanosis (P-32), activity-related out-of-breath (P-3), and 'looks fine otherwise' (P-9).",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: three main symptoms at presentation (wheezy for 4-5 days, short of breath, slight cough now) [P-1]; earliest symptoms as wheezy/difficulty deep breaths [P-2]; cough recent [P-1]. Missed: episodes of out-of-breath with activity [P-3], hard time catching breath without cyanosis [P-32], non-productive cough [P-31], looks fine otherwise [P-9]. Covers ~75% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: wheezing/shortness of breath in P-1/P-2/P-43, cough in P-1; no hallucinations or unverifiable details, phrasing closely grounded (e.g., 'quite wheezy,' 'difficulty taking in deep breaths,' 'slight cough').",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists the specific respiratory symptoms reported at presentation and clearly identifies the earliest ones (wheezy breathing) with timeline, perfectly addressing the question without off-topic content."
