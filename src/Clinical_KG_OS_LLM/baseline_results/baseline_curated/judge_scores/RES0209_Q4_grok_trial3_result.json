    "correctness": "Gold Answer details specific infection screening symptoms (recent colds/infections [D-21], loss of taste/smell [D-25], fevers [D-26], nausea/vomiting [D-27], belly pain [D-28], dry cough [D-14/15]) and exposures (sick contacts at home/frequent [D-22], outside home [D-23], travel [D-24]), all denied. Generated Answer incorrectly identifies chest tightness [D-20] and other health problems [D-29] as infection screening (these relate to asthma/general history, not infection-specific); lists general symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheezing) and asthma triggers (pollen, cold air) as responses instead of screening denials; gets COVID swab correct but overall significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: screens for colds/infections, taste/smell loss, fevers, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, dry cough (all covered with denials and citations); exposures to sick contacts (home/frequent, outside), travel (denied); D-29 explanation; COVID swab planned despite negatives. Generated covers only COVID swab (~10-20% at best); misses all specific screening symptoms/exposures/responses.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verifies chest tightness [D-20/P-20], other health problems [D-29/P-29], dry cough/SOB/wheezing [P-1/P-15], pollen/cold [P-9/P-11], COVID swab [D-29]; however, Generated hallucinates/misattributes these as 'screening for infectious causes' (e.g., chest tightness not for infection differentiation, pollen/cold are asthma triggers not exposures); purpose of 'differentiate from infectious' not in transcript; multiple misinterpretations qualify as hallucinated intent.",
    "relevance": "Generated attempts structure matching question (screened symptoms, responses, test planned) but fills with incorrect/misattributed transcript elements (asthma symptoms/triggers instead of infection screen); partially addresses via COVID swab but largely off-topic wrong content detracts from direct question focus."
