  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition ruled out despite family history and lists the exact symptoms (shortness of breath and wheezing absent even during physical activity) cited by the mother, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. However, there is a factual error: it attributes the family history report to 'the patient ([P-13])', whereas [P-13] discusses fevers, not family history; the correct reference is the mother in [P-28] mentioning grandparents. It also omits specifying grandparents and other details like the doctor's acknowledgment [D-30] or patient's overall health [P-24]. These are minor discrepancies with core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: asthma (100%), positive family history (mentioned but not specifying grandparents), mother citing no shortness of breath/wheezing even with physical activity (100%), 'worked up for that' (yes). Missed: explicit grandparents mention (question/Gold specifies), doctor's question/acknowledgment [D-28/D-30], mother's conclusion 'he doesn't have that', patient's healthy history/never had dry cough [P-24], notability of exercise absence given family hx. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in transcript: asthma/family history [P-28] yes, symptoms absent even with activity [P-28] yes, 'worked up' [P-28] yes. However, incorrect citation '[P-13]' for family history (actual [P-13] is fevers, not respiratory history) introduces a minor unverifiable/inaccurate detail. No major hallucinations; rest verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by naming asthma, noting family history consideration, and detailing mother's cited symptoms (no SOB/wheezing even during activity) for ruling it out. No irrelevant content; perfectly focused despite minor citation error."
