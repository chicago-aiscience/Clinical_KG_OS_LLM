  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the presence of greenish sputum, subjective fever, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and pain during coughing. However, it identifies the cough duration as 'at least a month' based on the sleep disruption timeframe, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer explicitly state the cough has lasted 'three months' [P-2].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several significant points: the 3-month total duration of the cough, its initial dry/intermittent nature, the absence of foul smell, and the impact on exercise. It also fails to list the majority of the symptoms explicitly denied by the patient (night sweats, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts), which was a specific part of the user's question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript and cite appropriate participant labels (e.g., P-2, P-19, P-4). No hallucinations were found.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant to the question asked, focusing solely on reported and denied symptoms without unnecessary preamble."
