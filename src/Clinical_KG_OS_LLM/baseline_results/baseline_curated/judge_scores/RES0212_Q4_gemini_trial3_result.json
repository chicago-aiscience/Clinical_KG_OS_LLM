  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the patient denied fatigue, while the patient actually stated they were 'a little tired' (P-19). It also fails to identify the specific constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis) and exposure risks (travel, sick contacts, IV drug use) that are central to the Gold Answer and the clinical context of the question.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses nearly all the specific screening details mentioned in the Gold Answer. It overlooks night sweats, unexplained weight loss, blood in sputum, sick contacts (classmates, roommate), and travel history. It focuses on less relevant 'risks' like cats and alcohol while ignoring the primary indicators for serious conditions like TB.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misrepresents the transcript by stating the patient denied significant fatigue when the patient affirmed being tired. It also references an external 'Knowledge Graph' not found in the provided source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer follows the prompt's structure and correctly identifies tuberculosis as a condition to exclude, but the lack of specific symptoms makes the relevance of the clinical reasoning weak."
