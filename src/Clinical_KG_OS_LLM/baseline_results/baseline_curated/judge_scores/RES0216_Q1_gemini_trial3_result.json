  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors regarding the 'denied symptoms' section. It claims that only chest pain was denied and that other symptoms (fever, chills, night sweats, etc.) were not mentioned in the transcript. However, turns D-11 through D-15 and P-11 through P-15 clearly show the patient being asked about and explicitly denying cough, fevers, night sweats, chills, and weight loss. It also misses the patient's report of hoarseness and phlegm.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the upper airway symptoms (hoarseness, phlegm, throat clearing). More importantly, it fails to list almost all the symptoms the patient denied (anxiety, sweating, fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, and cough), which were specifically requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer demonstrates a failure in faithfulness by claiming that certain symptoms were 'not mentioned in the transcript.' This is a hallucinated absence, as the transcript explicitly contains the dialogue for these screenings (D-11 to D-15).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly attempting to answer both parts of the prompt (present symptoms and denied symptoms), even though the content provided is largely incorrect."
