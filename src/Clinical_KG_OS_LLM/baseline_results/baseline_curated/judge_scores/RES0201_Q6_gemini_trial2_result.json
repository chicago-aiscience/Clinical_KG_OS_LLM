  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the doctor's assessment and management plan. It correctly cites the diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), the initial isolation instruction (until results return), and the specific condition for continued isolation (persistence of symptoms even if the test is negative). These facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and the source transcript [D-43].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all components requested in the prompt: assessment, management plan, specific tests, isolation instructions, and conditions for continued isolation. While the Gold Answer provides slightly more context regarding the patient's COPD history as a reason for the X-ray, the Generated Answer hits all the key requirements explicitly asked for in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The citations [D-43] for the assessment, tests, and isolation instructions are accurate and reflect the dialogue where the doctor outlines the next steps. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and structured to directly answer each part of the complex question. It avoids unnecessary filler and focuses strictly on the clinical assessment and management instructions provided by the doctor."
