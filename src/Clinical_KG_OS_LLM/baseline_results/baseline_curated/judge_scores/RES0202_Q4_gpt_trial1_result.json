  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies **asthma** as the condition the doctor would have added if the presentation were different, and correctly identifies **fever** as the key finding that made the doctor favor infection rather than asthma in the current workup. However, it contains minor inaccuracies: it cites the wrong speaker turn ([D-44] instead of [D-45]) and overstates the conclusion by implying fever essentially “rules out” asthma, whereas the Gold Answer notes asthma is not permanently ruled out—just deprioritized given a febrile infectious picture.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) asthma would be added if cough/SOB occurred **without fever**; (2) **presence of fever** led the doctor to focus on infection. Missing/underdeveloped: (a) the Gold Answer’s supporting context that the mother did **not** notice wheeze and did not clearly endorse SOB; (b) the nuance that asthma is not definitively excluded, just not prioritized.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims (asthma contingent on no fever; fever supports infection) are grounded in the transcript, but there are notable faithfulness issues: (1) incorrect citation to [D-44] (the asthma comment is in [D-45]); (2) mentions a “knowledge graph” and claims it provides evidence that fever rules out asthma—this is not present in the transcript and is an unsupported/hallucinated justification.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question (what condition would be added, and what finding excluded it from current workup) and does not add major irrelevant tangents."
