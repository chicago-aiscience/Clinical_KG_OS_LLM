  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately details cough as dry/non-productive (D-5/P-5, D-6/P-6), stable (D-7/P-7), 4-5 days (P-2/P-4), runny nose couple days and 'pretty clear' (D-11/P-11, D-12/P-12), plus history/negatives. Generated correctly identifies two symptoms and approximate durations but incorrectly states transcript lacks info on cough nature (productive/non-productive) and nasal appearance, missing/contradicting these core facts; 'not improving' approximates but not exact to 'stayed the same'. Significant factual errors on key characteristics.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: cough (4-5 days, dry, non-productive, stayed same), runny nose (couple days, pretty clear), never had like this before, no sore throat/chest pain/SOB/wheeze. Generated covers: cough 4-5 days/not improving (~partial duration/severity), runny nose couple days. Misses: dry/non-productive, clear appearance, stayed same, history, negatives. Covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Verifiable: symptoms cough/runny nose, durations [P-2, P-11] accurate citations. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'transcript does not provide specific information' on cough productive/non-productive (directly contradicted by D-5/P-5 dry, D-6/P-6 no gunk) and nasal appearance (D-12/P-12 pretty clear); mentions non-existent 'knowledge graph'. Multiple hallucinated/misstated facts about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Question asks specific respiratory symptoms reported, characteristics incl cough nature and nasal appearance. Generated directly structures response around two symptoms with subsections for characteristics/nature/appearance, even noting perceived lacks; no tangents, perfectly focused."
