  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the main Lyme-related features the clinician asked about (erythema migrans/bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/feeling ill, headaches) and the proposed evaluations (physical exam, send tick for species ID, Lyme serology/titres). Minor issues: it implies a focus on *Ixodes* species (not stated in the transcript) and cites [D-6] for tick speciation (the lab-send plan is in [D-6]/[D-18] generally, but [D-6] itself is mainly about rash; the definitive lab plan is clearer in [D-18]). No major contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are covered: absence of bullseye rash (explicit), screening for joint pain/fever/headaches, and proposing physical exam, tick identification, and serology.\nMissing or under-specified vs Gold: it does not explicitly state that joint pain, fever/illness, and headaches were *denied/absent* (it only says the doctor screened for them). It also omits that the patient was otherwise feeling well, and that there were no other bites found on self/husband. It also omits the plan to consult a supervising physician (less central to the question, but present in Gold).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript. However, adding “*Ixodes* species” is not directly stated, and one citation ([D-6]) is not the best support for the tick-species lab testing (that plan is most clearly stated in [D-18]). These are minor unverifiable/over-specific details rather than major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on (1) absent clinical features assessed for and (2) proposed diagnostic tests to evaluate/exclude Lyme disease, which directly answers the question without tangents."

  "summary": "Largely accurate and on-topic, capturing the main assessed symptoms and proposed tests, but it incompletely reports the explicitly absent/denied symptoms beyond the rash and adds a small amount of over-specific detail not stated in the transcript."
