  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the doctor screened for chest pain and that the patient denied it. However, it incorrectly attributes the patient's denial to citation [P-34], which in the transcript is actually a response to a question about smoking ('Do you smoke?'). The actual denial of chest pain occurs at [P-7].",
    "completeness": "The answer is highly incomplete. The Gold Answer lists approximately 12 distinct symptoms and exposures (chest pain, faintness, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea, and sputum production). The generated answer only mentions one (chest pain). Furthermore, it only identifies the cardiac differential, missing the infectious and gastrointestinal categories mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits a significant lack of faithfulness by misinterpreting the transcript. It claims [P-34] ('I don't, no') was a response to a question about associated symptoms for shortness of breath, when it was actually a response to a question about smoking habits. It also refers to the patient as 'her' without evidence in the transcript (though this is a minor point).",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it attempts to address the question, it ignores the plural nature of the prompt ('symptoms and exposures') and fails to capture the breadth of the doctor's screening process."
