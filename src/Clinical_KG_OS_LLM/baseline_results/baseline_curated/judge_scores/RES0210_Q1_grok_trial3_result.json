  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports all mentioned symptoms with correct citations from the transcript that align fully with the Gold Answer's facts: fever (P-5 matches Gold's description), chills (P-9), right-sided chest pain worsening with deep breath (P-17, P-18; Gold elaborates further but no contradiction), sputum as 'yellow custard' with red spots (P-6 exact), cough (P-1), and raw throat (P-15). The term 'pleuritic' is a reasonable clinical inference from the transcript without contradicting Gold. No factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: sputum description (yellow custard, red spots) fully; systemic symptoms (fever, chills) yes; chest pain location (right) and partial quality (worse deep breath, but misses constant, dull, worse with cough, present lying down); cough mentioned but misses timeline (Friday raspy, Sunday severe); sore throat yes; misses dyspnea on exertion, runny nose (resolved), no weight loss, sputum onset details. Covers approximately 60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., P-5 fever, P-6 sputum quote nearly exact, P-9 chills, P-17 pain location, P-18 deep breath). 'Pleuritic nature' is grounded in P-18 description. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question's focus on symptoms, sputum (color/appearance), chest pain (location/quality), and systemic symptoms (fever/chills), with additional relevant respiratory symptoms; no off-topic content."
