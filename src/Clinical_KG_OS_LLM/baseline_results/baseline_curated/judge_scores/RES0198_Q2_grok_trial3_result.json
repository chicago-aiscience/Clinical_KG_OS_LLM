  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the medication as 'decongestants' matching Gold [P-10]. Assessment is correctly quoted as 'working a little bit' and notes runny nose/not fully resolved, aligning closely with Gold's description though slightly less nuanced on ambiguity. Doctor's rec mentions Tylenol Cold correctly [D-39], but omits hydration and context; no contradictions, minor simplifications. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: 1) Tried OTC decongestants [P-10] - covered; 2) Assessment 'a little bit' with reasoning on runny nose [P-10] - partially covered (captures essence but less detail); 3) Supportive care/hydrated [D-39] - missed; 4) Tylenol Cold [D-39] - covered; 5) Viral, few weeks, limited treatment [D-39] - missed. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'decongestants' [P-10], 'working a little bit'/'runny' [P-10], 'Tylenol cold' [D-39]. No fabricated info; interpretations plausible and grounded in transcript text/citations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to answer the three-part question (med tried, assessment, doc rec) with no off-topic content or tangents."
