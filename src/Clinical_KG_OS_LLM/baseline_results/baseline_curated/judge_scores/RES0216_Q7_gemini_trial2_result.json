  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly implies that the symptoms have 'evolved into a significant respiratory issue,' suggesting a progression or worsening. However, the Gold Answer and transcript explicitly state the symptoms have been 'staying the same' and were 'pretty steady' [P-2, P-3]. It also incorrectly groups hoarseness and phlegm as an evolution of the tightness, whereas the patient describes these as separate or concurrent, but not necessarily an evolution of the chest tightness itself.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key requirements from the prompt: 1. It does not state whether the symptoms are getting better, worse, or staying the same (a direct prompt requirement). 2. It misses 'getting up out of a chair' as a specific exacerbating situation. 3. It fails to quantify the impact on the walking routine (reducing from twice daily to once daily), only stating it is 'challenging'. 4. It does not explicitly state the activity the patient was doing when symptoms *first* appeared (walking his dog [P-4]), though it mentions walking as a general trigger.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the transcript (hoarseness, phlegm, and breathlessness are mentioned), but the framing of these as an 'evolution' of the tightness is a slight interpretive stretch compared to the patient's statement that the condition is steady.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the general topic of chest tightness and its impact, but it omits several specific sub-questions asked in the prompt (specifically the trajectory/progression and the specific changes to the walking frequency)."
