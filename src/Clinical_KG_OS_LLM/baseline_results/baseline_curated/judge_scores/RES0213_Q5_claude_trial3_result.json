  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the three key factors (family history, smoking, psychosocial stressors) and accurately cites the transcript. The father's heart attack in his 50s, the smoking history (18 started, 10/day for 2 years, now ~5/day), and the Masters thesis stress are all correctly reported. The answer also accurately captures the patient's explicit connection between these factors and her heart disease concern.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer and actually expands on them with additional relevant detail. It includes: (1) the father's heart attack in his 50s and current cardiac care [P-8, P-30], (2) complete smoking history from age 18 to current reduction attempts [P-13, P-14, P-18], (3) Masters thesis deadline pressure and living alone [P-15, P-16, P-26, P-27], (4) the patient's explicit connection to stress [P-8], (5) anxiety symptoms and breathing changes [P-19], and (6) history of anxiety attacks potentially returning [P-22]. The answer also adds the important contextual detail about symptom triggers (alone vs. with others) [P-29].",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer includes proper transcript references [P-8], [P-13], [P-19], [P-29], etc. There are no hallucinated facts. The answer does reference a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the source material, but this appears to be a formatting artifact rather than substantive hallucination, as all clinical content is properly grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and thoroughly addresses the question, which asks how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors 'contribute to and interact with her concern about heart disease' and what details illustrate these connections. The structured breakdown (1. Family History, 2. Smoking, 3. Psychosocial Stressors) with 'Contribution' and 'Illustration' subsections precisely matches the question's requirements. There is no irrelevant content; even the conclusion synthesizes the interactions as requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer excellently addresses the question with complete accuracy, comprehensive coverage of all key points from the Gold Answer, perfect faithfulness to the source transcript with appropriate citations, and direct relevance to the specific question asked. The answer provides a well-structured analysis of how the three factors (family history, smoking, psychosocial stressors) contribute to and interact with the patient's heart disease concern, supported by specific transcript evidence. The minor reference to a 'knowledge graph' appears to be a formatting artifact and does not detract from the otherwise exemplary response."
