  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the sore throat as the first symptom starting ~4 days before the visit and notes failed self-treatment with salt-water gargles/painkillers. However, it contains several significant factual errors versus the Gold Answer/transcript: (1) It does not state that the sore throat progressively worsened (it does worsen per [P-4]) and omits the key swallowing difficulty detail (trouble swallowing food but can drink fluids per [P-2]). (2) It mishandles systemic symptoms: the transcript specifies muscle aches/tiredness started “immediately after” sore throat ([P-26]), but the Generated Answer says timing is not quantified. (3) It is incorrect about smell: the patient reports taste reduced “maybe… a little bit” but “not smell” ([P-19]); the Generated Answer states a total loss of smell. (4) It is incorrect/incomplete about dyspnea timing and trajectory: dyspnea started yesterday ([P-8]), is constant ([P-10]), and worsening ([P-9]); the Generated Answer does not give onset (yesterday), constancy, or worsening, and frames it only as a current concern.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: sore throat started 4 days ago; muscle aches/fatigue present; taste change present; difficulty breathing present; self-treatment ineffective.\nKey elements missed/insufficient: sore throat worsening over 4 days ([P-4]); dysphagia detail (food harder, fluids OK) ([P-2]); muscle aches/fatigue began immediately after sore throat ([P-26]) and characterization (tired, not weak) ([P-25]); taste started ~2 days ago and constant ([P-20], [P-21]) and smell not affected ([P-19]); dyspnea started yesterday, constant, worsening, and new/unlike prior ([P-8]–[P-11]). Overall, it captures less than half of the required chronological/severity-change detail.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are loosely grounded in the transcript (sore throat timing, attempted remedies, presence of muscle aches/tiredness, presence of breathing difficulty). However, there is a clear hallucination/contradiction: claiming total loss of smell when the transcript states smell is not affected ([P-19]). It also introduces imprecision that conflicts with explicit transcript timing (e.g., stating systemic symptom timing is unquantified despite [P-26]).",
    "relevance": "The response is largely aimed at symptom chronology and severity changes, which matches the question. It includes minor irrelevant framing (“medical knowledge provided”) and fails to deliver the requested day-by-day evolution, but it is still mostly on-topic."
