  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold identifies loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough as key symptoms; Generated matches exactly including 'mild dry cough' with correct citation [P-1]. Gold notes patient raised COVID concern [P-1]; Generated omits but does not contradict. Doctor's connection via [D-39] quote matches verbatim in both. Test as 'swab' [D-39] matches. No factual errors or contradictions in Generated's claims vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) symptoms (loss smell/taste/dry cough), (2) patient COVID worry [P-1], (3) doctor connection [D-39], (4) swab test [D-39], (5) confirmed absences (fever [P-10], SOB [P-11], etc.), (6) 'pretty well' summary [D-16], (7) narrow profile supports decision, (8) self-isolation [D-39]. Generated covers (1), (3), (4) fully (~40-50%); misses (2),(5-8). Partial coverage of core symptoms/connection/test but lacks fuller explanation of connection via ROS negatives and protocols. Score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: symptoms from [P-1], connection and swab quote from [D-39]. Citations accurate to transcript. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications. Fully grounded. Score 5.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for symptom combination, how doctor connected to diagnosis/test method. Generated directly states symptoms, quotes exact connection, specifies test method; no tangents or off-topic content. Perfectly focused. Score 5"
