  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient had tried over-the-counter decongestants and that the patient felt they worked \"a little bit\" (with lingering/runny symptoms). It also correctly reports the clinician’s OTC recommendation of \"Tylenol cold.\" These elements match the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key items asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) decongestants tried, (2) patient felt slight benefit/\"a little bit,\" (3) OTC recommendation: Tylenol Cold. It does not include the additional supportive-care advice (hydration) and time course expectations noted in the Gold Answer, though those details go beyond the specific OTC-treatment portion of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are directly supported by the transcript: decongestants and \"worked a little bit\" are in [P-10], and Tylenol Cold is in [D-39]. No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all components of the question (prior med tried, perceived effectiveness, and recommended OTC treatment) without extraneous detail."
