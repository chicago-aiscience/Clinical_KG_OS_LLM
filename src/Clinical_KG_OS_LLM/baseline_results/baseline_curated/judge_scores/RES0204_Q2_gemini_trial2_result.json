    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the COVID swab and the rationale provided in the transcript ('doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately'). It does not contain any factual errors regarding the information it provides.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is incomplete. The question asks for the diagnostic procedures (plural) proposed. The Gold Answer and transcript identify two procedures: a chest X-ray and a COVID-19 swab. The generated answer entirely omits the chest X-ray, which was the first procedure mentioned by the doctor.",

    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant to the question, specifically focusing on the diagnostic procedures and the rationale for the COVID swab without including extraneous information."
