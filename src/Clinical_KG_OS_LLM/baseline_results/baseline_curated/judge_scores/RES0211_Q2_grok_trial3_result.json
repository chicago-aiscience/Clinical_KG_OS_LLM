  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states Jessica is 'currently taking Claritin,' but the Gold Answer and transcript [P-25] clarify she carries it 'just in case' but is not actively taking it; it completely omits the birth control 'Deyo' (3-month oral pill) which is explicitly stated as currently taken [P-25-P-28]; for past treatments, it mentions allergy shots but omits dosing details ('once a week for a little while, like in the winter') [P-20]; it also denies EpiPen and details allergies not covered accurately. These are significant factual errors and omissions contradicting the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) Claritin (carries, not taking, allergies, citations); (2) Deyo (oral contraceptive, 3-month, details); (3) no med allergies; (4) allergy shots (dosing, timing); (5) no EpiPen, seasonal allergies details. Generated covers Claritin partially (~50% accurate) and allergy shots basically (~30% with no dosing), misses Deyo entirely, no allergies/EpiPen details; covers ~20-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like 'currently taking Claritin' contradict transcript [P-25]; hallucinates doctor's summary on symptoms flaring 'just before they normally start' [D-58 does not say this]; attributes dosing vaguely without transcript support; adds family history plausibly from [P-33] but not central; misses verifiable Deyo details; multiple inaccuracies and unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around 'Current Medications' and 'Past Treatments' matching question; includes indications and notes lack of dosing; minor tangents like family history and misquoted doctor summary but mostly focused on query."
