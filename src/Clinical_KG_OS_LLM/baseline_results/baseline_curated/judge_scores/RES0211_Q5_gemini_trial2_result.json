  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain information regarding Jessica's household living situation (living on a farm) or her schooling status (home-schooling during COVID). In reality, these are explicitly mentioned in P-41, P-42, and P-43. While it correctly identifies the brother's cold and the family history of allergies, this major error regarding the source text significantly impacts its accuracy.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses a key part of the Gold Answer: the synthesis of the isolated environment (farm/home-schooling) explaining why the brother's cold is the most likely source of transmission. It covers the family history and the brother's illness but fails to address the living situation and COVID context asked for in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a limitation, stating that certain information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present. It also references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question's components but fails to fulfill the request for the 'household living situation' and 'schooling' factors, effectively ignoring a significant portion of the prompt's specific requirements by claiming the data is unavailable. It also includes an unnecessary section on current diagnosis/symptoms not specifically requested by the prompt's focus on relationships of factors to symptoms.  "
