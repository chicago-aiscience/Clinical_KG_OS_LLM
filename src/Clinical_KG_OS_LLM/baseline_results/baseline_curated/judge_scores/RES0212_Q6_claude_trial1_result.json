  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the doctor stated they would 'review the story with the doctors' from [D-47]. It accurately describes the summary assessment including the cough present 'for a little while' that 'become bad in the last three days,' greenish sputum, nighttime awakening, and absence of blood. However, it adds an interpretation not stated in the transcript by calling it a 'respiratory infection' and references a 'knowledge graph' that doesn't exist in the source material. The Gold Answer correctly notes the absence of constitutional symptoms was explicitly stated, which the Generated Answer partially addresses but less clearly.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: the plan to review with doctors, the cough timeline, greenish sputum, nighttime awakening, and absence of blood. However, it misses several important details: (1) the explicit statement about 'no constitutional symptoms' lowering concern for TB/malignancy, (2) the context that this was a trainee encounter requiring supervision, (3) the patient's concern about missing exercise, (4) the doctor's response 'We'll see what we can do,' and (5) the explicit statement that no specific tests or treatments were ordered. The Generated Answer adds approximately 60-70% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations. It repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the source transcript. It characterizes the condition as a 'respiratory infection' - a diagnosis never stated by the doctor in the transcript. The doctor only summarized symptoms without providing a diagnosis. It also fabricates citation patterns like '[Knowledge Graph]' that appear nowhere in the source material. While the core facts about symptoms are grounded in the transcript, these hallucinations significantly compromise faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: the stated plan, the summary assessment, and what information would guide next steps. It stays focused on these topics without significant tangents. However, it includes irrelevant fabricated references to a knowledge graph that don't add value to answering the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's core components but contains critical flaws. It correctly identifies the plan to review with doctors and accurately describes key symptom details (greenish sputum, nighttime cough, timeline). However, it suffers from significant hallucinations, particularly the repeated fabricated references to a 'knowledge graph' and stating a diagnosis of 'respiratory infection' never mentioned in the transcript. It misses important contextual details about constitutional symptoms, the trainee-supervisor relationship, and the patient's exercise concerns. While relevantly structured and partially complete, the factual errors and hallucinations substantially undermine its quality."
