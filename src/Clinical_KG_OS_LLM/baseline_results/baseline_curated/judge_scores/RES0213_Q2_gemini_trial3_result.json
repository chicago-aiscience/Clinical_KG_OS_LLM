    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies all medications and supplements mentioned in the transcript (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer, and multivitamin) and accurately quotes the patient's feedback on their effectiveness.",
    "completeness": "While the generated answer covers the specific medications and supplements requested in the prompt, it misses several details provided in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the confirmation that the patient takes no prescription medications, as well as the non-medication stress management techniques (reading and running) and smoking status mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All points in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited using the provided labels (P-6, P-25).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and focused specifically on the question asked. It avoids the additional lifestyle context included in the Gold Answer that was not explicitly requested (such as smoking and running)."
