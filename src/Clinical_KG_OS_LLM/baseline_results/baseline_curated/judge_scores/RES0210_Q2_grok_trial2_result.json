  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies Lipitor for high cholesterol (correctly matched) and Tylenol (OTC) for symptom relief with partial effectiveness ('helps a little bit'), confirmed as only prescribed med, no others. Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for hypercholesterolemia/cholesterol but completely misses Tylenol mentioned in [P-14], incorrectly states no OTC meds, and hallucinates 'knowledge graph data'. Significant contradictions on OTC meds and additions not in transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) Lipitor (atorvastatin) for high cholesterol [P-25,26]; 2) only prescribed med [P-27]; 3) Tylenol OTC for fever/symptoms, 'helps a little bit' [P-14]; 4) non-med clearing gunk [P-13]; 5) no other meds. Generated covers only Lipitor/condition partially (~25-30% coverage), misses all OTC and effectiveness entirely.",
    "faithfulness": "Lipitor verifiable in [P-25,26]; however, 'knowledge graph data' is hallucinated/not in transcript. Claims no OTC despite explicit Tylenol in [P-14] ('I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit') – ignores verifiable evidence, effectively hallucinating absence. Minor misquote ('soar throat'). Multiple issues with grounding.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around prescribed/OTC meds, conditions, and OTC effectiveness per question, with no off-topic content or tangents – perfectly focused despite factual errors."
