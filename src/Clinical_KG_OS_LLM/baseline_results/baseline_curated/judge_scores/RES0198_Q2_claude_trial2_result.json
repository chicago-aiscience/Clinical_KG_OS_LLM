  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies decongestants as the medication tried, accurately captures the patient's assessment as 'working a little bit,' and correctly identifies Tylenol Cold as the doctor's OTC recommendation. All core facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key components of the question (medication tried, assessment, and recommendation). However, it lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the patient's reasoning about the nose transitioning from stuffy to runny, the doctor's mention of staying hydrated, and the timeline of 'a few weeks' for symptom resolution. These omissions represent approximately 20-25% of the Gold Answer's key details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-10] and [D-39]. The answer does not include any hallucinated information and stays grounded in the source material. The citation accuracy is excellent.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question without any irrelevant content. It is focused, well-organized, and provides a clear, structured response to each component of the multi-part question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-cited response to all three components of the question. It correctly identifies the decongestants tried, the patient's assessment of partial effectiveness, and the doctor's Tylenol Cold recommendation. While factually correct and highly relevant, it lacks some contextual details from the Gold Answer such as the patient's reasoning about symptom transition, hydration advice, and timeline expectations. The answer demonstrates strong faithfulness to the source material with appropriate citations and no hallucinations."
