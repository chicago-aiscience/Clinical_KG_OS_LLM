  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition and fever as the excluding factor, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. However, it inaccurately cites [D-44] instead of [D-45] for the doctor's statement, misphrases the exclusion as definitively 'ruling out' asthma (Gold notes it's not permanent), and introduces a non-existent 'knowledge graph' with fabricated supporting evidence, creating discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: condition (asthma), hypothetical addition if no fever with cough/SOB, exclusion due to fever (with temp details from [P-1,P-2]). Missed: exact quote/citation from [D-45], conclusion 'sounds like an infection', supporting details like no wheezing [P-7] and uncertain SOB [P-8], nuance that asthma is not permanently ruled out. Covers ~80% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims (asthma, fever exclusion) are verifiable in transcript [D-45], but citation is wrong ([D-44] discusses COVID swab, not asthma). Hallucinates 'knowledge graph' and claim that it shows 'fever rules out asthma medical history', which is not in transcript. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question (condition: asthma; excluding finding: fever) with focused response, minor irrelevant addition of knowledge graph."
