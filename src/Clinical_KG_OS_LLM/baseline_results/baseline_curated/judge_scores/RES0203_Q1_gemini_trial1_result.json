  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies the loss of taste as 'complete'. According to the transcript [P-4] and the Gold Answer, the taste loss was partial, as the patient could still perceive 'really, really salty foods'.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to include almost all specific details requested in the prompt. It misses the details of what the patient could still perceive (bad smells, salty foods) and could not perceive (bananas, 'normal things'). It also omits details about the cough being non-productive (no sputum or blood).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer relies solely on the patient's initial statement in [P-1] and ignores the clarification in [P-4]. While it cites the transcript, claiming 'complete loss' is unfaithful to the clinical reality established in the full dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the symptoms but completely ignores the second half of the prompt's instruction to 'Include any details the patient provided about what they could and could not still perceive.'"
