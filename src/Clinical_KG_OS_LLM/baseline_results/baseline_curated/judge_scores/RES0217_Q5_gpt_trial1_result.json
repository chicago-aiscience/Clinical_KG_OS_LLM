  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly explains the timing logic for estimating >72 hours of attachment: it cites the patient being outdoors Friday and Saturday and the clinician’s explicit statement that this implies “longer than at least 72 hours” [D-6]. However, it is factually incorrect about the geographic/map justification. The transcript explicitly includes the doctor referencing the Ontario Lyme distribution map and stating “Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point,” followed by moving forward with antibiotics [D-13]. The generated answer wrongly claims this detail is not present and incorrectly asserts the prophylaxis rationale relied on prior bullseye rash history; in the transcript, the clinician uses duration and geography, and notes absence of current bullseye rash as reassuring.",
    "completeness": "It covers the attachment-duration component (Friday hiking + Saturday gardening + discovery/removal today leading to >72 hours and prophylaxis). It fails to include the key second part of the gold answer: the doctor’s use of Strathroy’s location on the Ontario Lyme distribution map (“close enough…concerning point”) to further justify antibiotics [D-13]. It also omits the explicit linkage that the combination of prolonged attachment and geographic concern led to proceeding with antibiotics.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: (1) it claims the map-based justification is not present, directly contradicting [D-13]; (2) it suggests the doctor relied on the patient’s prior bullseye rash history to justify prophylaxis, which is not how the clinician frames the decision; (3) it adds a general claim about a ‘typical window’ for transmission prevention that is not stated in the transcript. These reduce grounding and introduce misleading elements.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely on-topic (tick attachment duration and prophylaxis rationale, plus geographic risk), but it does not actually answer the geographic-justification part correctly and instead negates it. This makes it only partially responsive to the full question."
