  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the symptoms mentioned (cough, sputum appearance, right-sided chest pain, fever, chills, and sore throat).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: the specific timeline of the cough (Friday/Sunday), the subjective nature of the fever (not measured, 'just felt hot'), the 'dull' and 'constant' quality of the chest pain, the mild dyspnea on exertion (getting winded on stairs), and the historical runny nose.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript. Citations like [P-5], [P-9], and [P-17] are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's specific requirements regarding sputum, chest pain, and systemic symptoms."
