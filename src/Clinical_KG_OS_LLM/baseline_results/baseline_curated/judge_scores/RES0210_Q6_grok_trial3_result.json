  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor's plan and self-care measures are not present in the transcript, contradicting Gold Answer's accurate citation of [D-43] for the plan and [P-13], [P-14], [P-10] for self-care (expectoration, Tylenol, rest); partially correct on aggravating factors like exertion [P-10] and deep breathing [P-18], but misattributes coughing effect to chest via wrong citation [P-15] (sore throat, not chest pain as in [P-19]); claims no alleviating factors despite evidence; mentions non-existent Knowledge Graph, leading to significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: doctor's plan [D-43] (missed), self-care Tylenol [P-14], expectoration [P-13], rest [P-10] (missed), aggravating deep breathing [P-18], coughing [P-19], exertion [P-10/11] (partially covered exertion and deep breathing, wrong on coughing), alleviating (missed), clinical relevance (missed); covers only ~25% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims plan/self-care absent despite [D-43], [P-13/14/10]; exertion [P-10] verifiable, deep breathing [P-18] verifiable, but coughing tied to [P-15] (throat rawness, not chest pain); no alleviating despite [P-13/14]; references 'Knowledge Graph' not in transcript (hallucination); multiple inaccuracies in claiming absence.",
    "relevance": "Addresses aggravating/alleviating factors directly with sections; notes 'missing' for plan/self-care, attempting to cover question parts despite errors; minor tangent with Knowledge Graph, but overall focused on query elements."
