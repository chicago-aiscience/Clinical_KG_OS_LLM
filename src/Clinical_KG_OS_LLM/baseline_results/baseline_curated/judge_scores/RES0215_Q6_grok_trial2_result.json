  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's three immediate next steps (physical exam, consultation with physician, follow-up discussion) directly from [D-58], consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies carpets as an assessed environmental factor with accurate citation [P-54]. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer or transcript; however, by presenting only carpets as the environmental factors assessed, it introduces a minor discrepancy as the Gold Answer lists multiple factors comprehensively.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: doctor's plan (physical exam, consult physician, return to discuss next steps) - fully covered (100%); no specific tests/imaging/medications named - not covered; offered questions to mother (declined) - not covered; environmental factors (smoking denied [P-53], new carpets [P-54], no pets [P-55], no wood-burning [P-56], air filters changed [P-57], townhouse [P-50], family context [P-49]) - only carpets covered (1 out of 7, ~14%). Overall coverage approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: physical exam, consultation, and follow-up from [D-58]; carpets from [P-54]. Citations are accurate. No hallucinated facts or unverifiable details; content is fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures its response around the two core parts of the question (doctor's plan and environmental factors), using clear headings and citations. No off-topic content or tangents; perfectly focused on addressing the query."
