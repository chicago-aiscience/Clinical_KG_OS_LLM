  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that eczema, EpiPen use, and night sweats were not addressed in the transcript, when in fact all three were explicitly discussed (D-9/P-9 for night sweats, D-18/D-21/P-18/P-21 for EpiPen/severe allergic reactions, D-32/D-33/P-33 for eczema). The answer also misrepresents the screening process, claiming it was limited to asthma and medication history when the Gold Answer shows extensive screening across multiple dimensions. The citation [D-58] is incorrect - this section is the summary, not the systematic screening questions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only approximately 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions asthma screening but omits: night sweats screening and response, productive cough/sputum screening, severe allergic reaction screening (breathing difficulty/facial swelling), EpiPen confirmation, family history of asthma details, eczema family history, rashes/skin changes, GI symptoms, and joint pain. The answer focuses narrowly on asthma and medication rather than the comprehensive systematic screening described in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains multiple instances of unfaithful representation. It claims the transcript 'does not contain patient responses regarding these specific conditions' when they are clearly present. The citation to [D-58] as the location of asthma screening is incorrect - this is actually the summary section. The answer also makes inferential leaps about diagnosis narrowing that are not grounded in the specific screening questions asked in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer partially addresses the question by discussing asthma screening, but fails to cover the systematic nature of the screening or the multiple other conditions mentioned in the question prompt (eczema, EpiPen/allergic reactions, night sweats). It spends significant space on clinical interpretation rather than answering what conditions were screened for and what Jessica's responses were."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates major deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It incorrectly claims that key screening questions (night sweats, eczema, EpiPen) were not in the transcript when they clearly were, covers only about 20% of the systematic screening described in the Gold Answer, uses incorrect citations, and makes claims not grounded in the transcript. While it correctly identifies asthma screening, it misses the majority of the systematic review of systems and fails to accurately represent Jessica's responses that helped narrow the differential diagnosis."
