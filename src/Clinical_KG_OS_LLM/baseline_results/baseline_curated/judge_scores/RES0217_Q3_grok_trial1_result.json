  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday [P-1]), tick attachment duration (>72 hours [D-6]), and prior history (tick bite with bullseye rash requiring antibiotics [P-3]), matching the Gold Answer. For geographic risk, it references the deer tick as the vector [D-5] and visual mismatch, but omits the specific Strathroy location [P-12], Ontario Lyme map consultation, and 'concerning point' assessment [D-13], representing a minor discrepancy while keeping core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: exposure history (hiking/gardening [P-1]), duration (>72 hours [D-6]), prior history (bullseye rash/antibiotics [P-3]), and partial geographic risk (deer tick vector [D-5]). Missed: specific Strathroy/creek location [P-12], Lyme map review and 'concerning point' [D-13], patient's comment on all ticks as carriers [P-5], lab identification plan [D-6/D-18], and 'safer than not' rationale [D-18]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [D-6] for duration, [P-1] for exposure, [P-3] for prior history, [D-5] for deer tick). No hallucinations; interpretive summary (e.g., factors 'outweighed' absence of rash) is grounded in doctor's decision-making [D-6, D-13, D-18]. Minor mention of 'knowledge graph' is extraneous but not fabricating transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures its response around the four specified factors (exposure, duration, geographic risk, prior history) from the question, addresses the 'even though' qualifiers (no deer tick resemblance, no current rash), and focuses solely on the doctor's recommendation rationale without off-topic content."
