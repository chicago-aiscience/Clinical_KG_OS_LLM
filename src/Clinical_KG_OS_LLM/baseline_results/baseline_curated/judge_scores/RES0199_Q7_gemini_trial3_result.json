  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the initial symptoms (headache/cough at 4 days) and the most recent symptom (loss of smell at 1 day). While it uses the patient's initial general phrase 'few days back' for GI symptoms instead of the specific '2 days ago' for diarrhea and 'yesterday' for vomiting mentioned later in the transcript and Gold Answer, it remains factually accurate to the patient's statements.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer and requested by the prompt. It does not mention the specific '2 days ago' timing for diarrhea, the 'yesterday' timing for vomiting, or the 'today' timing for nausea. It also omits the numerical pain scale for the headache (7/10) and the pertinent negatives (no fever/chills) included in the Gold Answer. Crucially, it only implies stability in severity ('persistent', 'present') rather than explicitly stating the symptoms 'stayed around the same' as the prompt specifically requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript. Every claim made is directly supported by the patient's dialogue, and there are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the onset, the timing of GI and sensory symptoms, and the status of the cough and headache. However, it is slightly less focused on the 'severity' aspect of the cough/headache compared to the Gold Answer."
