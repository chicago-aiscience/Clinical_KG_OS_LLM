  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the specific frequency of Ventolin usage was not mentioned in the transcript. However, in turn [P-12], the patient explicitly states they used it 'almost like 10 times this past week'. Other information regarding the medications (Ventolin, Spiriva, Atorvastatin) and the discontinued diuretic is correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to provide the specific frequency of Ventolin usage (10 times), which was a direct part of the question. It covers the names of the medications and the details of the discontinued diuretic well.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the frequency of Ventolin use was not stated is a hallucination of absence, as the information is clearly present in turn [P-12]. The rest of the answer is well-grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question, although it provides an incorrect negative response for the frequency component."
