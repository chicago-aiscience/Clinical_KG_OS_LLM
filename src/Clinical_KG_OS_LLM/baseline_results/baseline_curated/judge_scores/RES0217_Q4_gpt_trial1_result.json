  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main Lyme features the clinician asked about (erythema migrans/bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/illness, headaches) and correctly lists the proposed evaluations (physical exam, sending the tick for species identification, and bloodwork for titres/serology). However, it implies “definitively evaluate and exclude” Lyme disease (where the transcript only states serology/titres to gauge concern), and it includes a minor citation issue by referencing [D-6] for tick identification (tick ID is discussed at [D-5], [D-6], and especially [D-18], but [D-6] itself is about rash). It also adds “Ixodes” (not stated explicitly in the transcript, though consistent with “deer tick”). Overall, facts align with the Gold Answer with minor imprecision.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) erythema migrans asked about and denied with only local redness/tenderness; (2) screening for joint pain, fever/illness, headaches; (3) proposed tests: physical exam, tick sent to lab for species ID, bloodwork for titres/serology.\nKey points missed or under-specified: the question asks features “assessed for and found absent,” but the Generated Answer does not explicitly state the patient denied joint pain, fever/illness, and headaches; it also omits that the clinician confirmed the patient felt well otherwise, omits the “no other bites” confirmation, and omits the plan to consult the supervising physician. Therefore coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (questions about rash/joint pain/fever/headache; plan for physical exam; sending tick to lab; serology/titres). Minor ungrounded/overstated elements include mentioning a “knowledge graph,” adding “Ixodes,” and framing testing as “definitively exclude.” A minor citation mismatch is present. Still, there are no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the two requested elements: absent clinical features of active Lyme disease and proposed diagnostic tests. Aside from a brief, unnecessary mention of a “knowledge graph,” there is little extraneous content."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and on-topic regarding what was assessed and what tests were proposed, but it incompletely reports which symptoms were explicitly absent and omits several Gold Answer details (e.g., explicit denials for multiple symptoms, feeling well otherwise, no other bites, and planned physician consult)."
