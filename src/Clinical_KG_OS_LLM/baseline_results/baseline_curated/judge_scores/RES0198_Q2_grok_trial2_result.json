  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient tried 'decongestants' [P-10], matching the Gold. The assessment of 'working a little bit' with nose still runny and not fully resolved aligns closely with the transcript and Gold's description of ambiguity and partial effectiveness. The doctor's OTC recommendation of 'Tylenol cold' [D-39] is correct, though Gold includes additional supportive care details; no factual errors present.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) decongestants tried - covered; (2) assessment ambiguous/'little bit'/reasoning stuffy to runny - mostly covered ('little bit', runny persists, not fully resolved), but misses explicit reasoning quote; (3) rec hydrated + Tylenol Cold + viral context - partially covered (Tylenol Cold yes, misses hydration and context). Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: decongestants and assessment from [P-10], Tylenol cold from [D-39]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured to directly answer the three-part question (med tried, assessment, OTC rec) with bullet points, no off-topic content; perfectly focused."
