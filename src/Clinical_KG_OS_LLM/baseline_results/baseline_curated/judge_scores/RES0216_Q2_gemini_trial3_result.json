  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states that the patient 'maintains adherence' to his maintenance inhaler. While the patient does take it daily, he explicitly mentions in [P-19] that he is supposed to take it twice a day (morning and night) but has been skipping the night dose for a while. This constitutes a change in dosing frequency and an adherence gap that the generated answer fails to identify. Additionally, it omits Tylenol, which is listed in the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer: 1) It fails to mention Tylenol as an occasional medication. 2) Most significantly, it misses the specific change in dosing frequency for the maintenance inhaler (moving from twice daily to once daily), which was explicitly requested in the prompt. 3) It does not mention the doctor's summary about 'limiting' medication.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the transcript (e.g., mention of Ramipril, Salbutamol, and the lack of rescue inhaler), but it is unfaithful to the full context of the patient's statement in [P-19] regarding the maintenance inhaler frequency.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured well and addresses the main categories of the question, but by missing the specific 'changes to dosing frequency' detail, it fails to fully answer the specific sub-questions of the prompt."
