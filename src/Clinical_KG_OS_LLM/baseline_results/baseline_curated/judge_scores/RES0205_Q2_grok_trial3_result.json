  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states patient is not taking any prescribed medications overall [P-23], previously took anxiety meds 2-3 years ago [P-24], manages acid reflux with diet only [P-25], no treatment for hay fever [P-27], no meds for cough yet [P-35, D-37]. Generated Answer correctly notes no meds for cough, diet for reflux with specifics, no current anxiety treatment. Minor discrepancies: misses explicit overall no meds statement, past anxiety med detail, hay fever entirely; adds irrelevant 'knowledge graph' not in transcript. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) no current prescribed meds [P-23]; (2) past anxiety meds [P-24]; (3) reflux diet details [P-25]; (4) no reflux meds; (5) hay fever no treatment [P-27]; (6) cough no meds prescribed yet [P-35/D-37]. Covered: (3) fully, (4) fully, (1) implied for cough/anxiety, (6) partially (asks for meds, no current). Missed: (2), (5), explicit overall no meds, doctor plan. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptom/treatment claims verifiable: cough details [P-2/5/15/35], COVID [P-35], reflux diet [P-25], anxiety mention [P-22]. Citations accurate. Minor hallucination: 'provided knowledge graph' not in transcript. No other fabrications; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing current med/treatment status by condition (cough, reflux, anxiety), including reflux management and no prescribed meds where applicable. Symptom details contextualize cough status without derailing focus; highly relevant."
