  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several factual inaccuracies compared to the Gold Answer and transcript. It incorrectly states that the cough started 'a couple of days' ago, ignoring the patient's clarification in [P-3] that it was Friday. It claims there is 'no exact discrete day' for the chest pain, whereas the patient specifies in [P-20] that they noticed it 'over the last day' (Tuesday). Additionally, it misattributes the 'raw' sensation from the sore throat [P-15] to the chest pain.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the runny nose from a week prior. It also fails to provide the specific onset days for three of the five requested symptoms: the raspy cough (Friday), the fever (Monday), and the chest pain (Tuesday), using vague or incorrect timelines instead ('couple of days', 'next day', 'no exact day').",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded but contains a significant misinterpretation/hallucination regarding the 'raw' sensation being located in the chest instead of the throat. It also claims the patient does not specify a day for chest pain, which contradicts the transcript [P-20].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure of a timeline followed by a worsening clinical picture, directly addressing the prompt's intent."
