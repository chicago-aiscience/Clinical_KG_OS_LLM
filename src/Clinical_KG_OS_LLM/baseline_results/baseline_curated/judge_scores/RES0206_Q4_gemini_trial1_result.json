  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19), the test (COVID swab), and the specific social contact details (walking dogs with a sick friend and walking too close) as described in both the transcript and the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer addresses all three parts of the question. However, compared to the gold answer, it omits additional context such as the doctor's inquiry about the friend's COVID test status and the screening for other COVID-specific symptoms (loss of taste/smell, etc.) which provided the full clinical context for the doctor's consideration.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited using the provided identifiers.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and focused. It answers the specific questions asked without including the additional screening details present in the gold answer, though those details were relevant to the 'consideration' aspect of the prompt."
