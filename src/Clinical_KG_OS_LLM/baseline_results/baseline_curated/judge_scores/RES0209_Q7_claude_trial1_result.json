    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors when compared to the Gold Answer. Most critically, it states the patient is now experiencing 'nighttime symptoms occur every other day or like... every two days [P-18]' as evidence of near-daily use, but this misrepresents P-18 which discusses nighttime symptoms, not bronchodilator frequency. The Gold Answer correctly identifies bronchodilator use increased from 'once every two weeks' to 'almost everyday like five six times a week' based on P-8. The Generated Answer fails to mention the baseline frequency of 'once every two weeks' at all, which is central to the question. It also incorrectly frames the temporal evolution - the question asks about progression through three distinct periods (initial diagnosis, baseline with biweekly use, current exacerbation), but the Generated Answer only addresses two periods vaguely.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the specific baseline bronchodilator frequency of once every two weeks, (2) the explicit current frequency of 5-6 times per week, (3) the two-week duration of the current exacerbation, (4) the detail that wheezing episodes exceed bronchodilator use frequency, (5) chest tightness as a symptom, (6) that no precipitant was identified despite screening for infections. The answer covers approximately 40% of the key temporal and clinical details requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains claims not supported by the transcript. The statement about 'running around after gym during recess' being a trigger at age eight is an extrapolation - P-9 discusses current triggers, not historical ones at diagnosis. The characterization of nighttime symptoms occurring 'every other day or like... every two days' as indicating 'near-daily use' conflates symptom frequency with medication frequency. However, most claims are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question's focus on temporal evolution but does so incompletely. It structures the response around three time periods as requested, but fails to adequately characterize the baseline period (missing the crucial 'once every two weeks' detail) and conflates symptom frequency with medication frequency in the current period. The answer includes relevant trigger information but misses the quantitative progression central to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to trace the temporal evolution of asthma symptoms but contains significant factual errors and omissions. It fails to identify the baseline bronchodilator frequency (once every two weeks) and the specific current frequency (5-6 times per week), which are central to answering the question. The answer conflates nighttime symptom frequency with medication usage frequency, misrepresenting the data from P-18. While it correctly identifies some symptoms and triggers with appropriate citations, it misses approximately 60% of the key clinical details and temporal markers present in the Gold Answer. The structural attempt to address three time periods shows relevance to the question, but the execution lacks the specificity and accuracy needed for clinical documentation."
