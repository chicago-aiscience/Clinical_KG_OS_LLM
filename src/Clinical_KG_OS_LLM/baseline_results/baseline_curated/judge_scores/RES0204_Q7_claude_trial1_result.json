  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key timeline facts: dry cough onset 4-5 days ago, runny nose developing in 'the past couple of days,' making the cough precede the runny nose by 2-3 days. However, it contains a significant factual error regarding cough severity - it states the cough has 'persisted with consistent severity' but the Gold Answer clearly states it 'kind of stayed the same' [D-7, P-7], which is the same meaning but the Generated Answer fails to capture the nuance of 'neither worsening nor improving.' More importantly, it introduces irrelevant comparisons about fever history and asthma that were not part of the patient's 'prior experiences with similar symptoms' as requested in the question.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main timeline elements (cough 4-5 days, runny nose couple days, cough preceded runny nose by 2-3 days) but misses several key points from the Gold Answer: (1) characterization of discharge as 'pretty clear,' (2) the explicit statement about cough stability from [D-7, P-7], (3) the crucial comparison that the patient 'never had like a dry cough like this' before [P-24], (4) that previous runny noses 'never lasted this long' [P-24], and (5) that patient had been 'pretty healthy otherwise' [P-24]. The Generated Answer addresses roughly 50-60% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are verifiable in the transcript. The timeline details about cough (4-5 days) and runny nose (couple days) are accurate. However, the section on 'Comparison to Prior Experiences' introduces misleading content. The statement 'Unlike previous episodes where the patient has noted fevers [P-13]' is a misinterpretation - [P-13] actually says the patient 'has had fevers in the past' but NOT that these were associated with similar episodes. The asthma comparison, while factually drawn from the transcript, is irrelevant to comparing 'prior experiences with similar symptoms' as the question asks.",
    "relevance": "The answer partially addresses the question. It covers the symptom timeline and relative timing well, which are core to the question. However, it fails to adequately address 'changes in severity of the cough' (only briefly mentions persistence) and significantly diverges when discussing 'how the current episode compared to the patient's prior experiences' - instead of focusing on comparing to prior similar symptoms (which Gold Answer addresses with P-24), it discusses unrelated medical history about fever and asthma. About 60-70% of content is directly relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the basic symptom timeline (cough 4-5 days, runny nose couple days later) but has significant gaps. It misses key details about cough severity remaining stable, the characterization of nasal discharge, and crucially fails to properly address the comparison to prior similar episodes - instead introducing irrelevant medical history about fever and asthma. The answer covers approximately 50-60% of the Gold Answer's key points and contains some misinterpretations, particularly in the 'Comparison to Prior Experiences' section, though most basic facts remain grounded in the transcript."
