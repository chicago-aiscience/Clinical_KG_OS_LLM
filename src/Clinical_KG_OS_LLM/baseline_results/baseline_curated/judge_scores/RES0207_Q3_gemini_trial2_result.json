  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medication (Keppra) and the patient's statement regarding the missed dose. It accurately links the missed dose to the seizure. However, it references a 'knowledge graph' which does not exist in the source transcript, though the clinical conclusion remains accurate to the text.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary connection and the specific evidence from P-9. It misses several supporting details found in the Gold Answer: the specific reason for the missed dose (daughter's birthday/routine change), the fact that seizures are rare for this patient, and the context that this was volunteered without clinician prompting about adherence.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information. The rest of the claims regarding the patient's statements and the medication name are supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the connection between the missed dose and the seizure as requested by the prompt."
