{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most elements match the Gold Answer and transcript: COVID swab ordered with 24–48h turnaround, 14-day isolation, possibility of false negatives, alternative diagnosis of another circulating viral illness if negative, and ER red flags (high temp, neuro symptoms مثل seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). One minor inaccuracy/overstatement: the Generated Answer says the fever “ruled out” asthma as a primary differential; the transcript states asthma would be added if cough/SOB occurred *without* fever, implying fever makes infection more likely, not that asthma is ruled out entirely.",
    "completeness": "Covers the major required components: test + turnaround, isolation duration, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negatives, and detailed ER warning signs with examples (seizures). Misses two items present in the Gold Answer/transcript that contribute to a “complete” plan: (1) isolation including separation from the younger sister if possible; (2) explicit watchful-waiting/no-medications/“wait for the swab results” framing (though partially implied).",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by [D-44] and [D-45]. The only partially unsupported phrasing is that fever “ruled out” asthma, which is a stronger inference than stated. No major hallucinations or fabricated interventions/medications are introduced.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question’s requested elements (assessment, ordered test + turnaround, isolation period, alternative dx if negative, false negatives, and ER warning signs with examples). No meaningful tangents."
