  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states the patient takes only two medications (Salbutamol and Ramipril), omitting Tylenol which the Gold Answer and transcript [P-27] include as occasional for headaches. It misrepresents adherence to the maintenance inhaler as fully maintained, contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [P-19, P-20] where the patient reports skipping the evening dose and now taking only mornings, despite being prescribed twice daily. It correctly notes no rescue inhaler refill [P-17, P-18] but attributes conditions via a non-existent 'knowledge graph.' These are significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: Salbutamol for asthma (partial), Ramipril for high blood pressure/hypertension (yes), no rescue inhaler available/refilled in couple years (yes). Missed entirely: Tylenol for headaches; prescribed twice-daily maintenance inhaler now reduced to once daily with self-skipping of evening dose; justification of no problems with reduced dose; clinician confirmation and summary of adherence gaps. Covers roughly 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Cites transcript accurately for some quotes [P-17, P-25, P-26], but hallucinates 'knowledge graph' twice to confirm conditions (not in transcript). Misinterprets adherence: claims 'maintains adherence to daily maintenance' but transcript [P-19] shows reduction to morning-only, not full regimen. Distinguishes maintenance from Salbutamol but patient lists Salbutamol as current med [P-25] post-puffer discussion. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question with sections on current medications/conditions and asthma adherence changes, including dosing and rescue availability; minor extraneous note on maintenance but no major off-topic content."
