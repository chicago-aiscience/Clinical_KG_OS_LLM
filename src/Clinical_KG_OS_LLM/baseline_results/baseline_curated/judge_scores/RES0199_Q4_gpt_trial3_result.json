  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the main condition to rule out, the ordered diagnostic test as a swab, the expected turnaround as 24–48 hours, and the alternative diagnosis as another viral illness if negative—these match the Gold Answer. No clinically meaningful contradictions with the Gold Answer are present. The only mild issue is referencing a “knowledge graph” as support, which is not part of the Gold Answer (but does not make the stated clinical facts wrong).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) swab test, (3) 24–48h turnaround, (4) isolate 14 days while awaiting results, (5) public health contact tracing if positive, (6) alternative diagnosis = another viral illness if negative, (7) supportive management regardless. The Generated Answer covers (1), (2), (3), (6), and partially (7), but omits (4) and (5). This is ~5/7 key points (~71%), so not fully complete vs the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims (COVID-19, swab, 24–48h, alternative viral illness) are directly supported by the transcript at [D-52]. However, the answer adds “knowledge graph” justifications and a KG-style citation (e.g., \"KG: TREATMENT hydration...\") that are not in the transcript, making parts of the reasoning/citation structure unverifiable. Because there is some non-transcript content presented as support, faithfulness is reduced.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what was asked: condition to rule out, test and turnaround time, and alternative diagnosis if negative. The “knowledge graph” references are a minor tangent but do not distract substantially from answering the question."
