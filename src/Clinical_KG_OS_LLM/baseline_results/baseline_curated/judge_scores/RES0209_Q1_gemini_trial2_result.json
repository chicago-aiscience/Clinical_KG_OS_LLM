{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and consistent with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the patient's age (10), the nature of the cough (dry, nonstop), the breathing difficulties (shortness of breath), the presence of wheezing, and the relative frequency of symptoms between day and night.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few specific details found in the gold answer. Notably, it fails to mention 'chest sensations' (chest tightness) despite this being explicitly requested in the prompt. It also omits the duration of the cough (two weeks) and the detail that wheezing occurs more frequently than bronchodilator use.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. The use of direct quotes and citations [P-1], [P-15], [P-18] is accurate and verifiable against the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's requirements regarding cough character, breathing difficulty, wheezing, and frequency differences. However, the omission of 'chest sensations' is a slight lapse in addressing the specific multi-part structure of the question."
