  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correct: Notes onset 4–5 days and that wheeze was present at presentation (matches [P-1]). Notes slight cough present by time of consult (matches [P-1]). Notes single night-time wheeze that self-resolved (matches [P-43]). Notes cold weather makes it worse (supported by [P-38]).\n- Incorrect vs Gold: The **initial trigger** is stated as cold exposure, but the Gold Answer identifies the initial trigger as **physical activity (playing tag) leading to being quite out of breath** ([P-3]). Cold weather is an exacerbating factor, not the initial trigger.\n- Incorrect vs Gold: The **fluctuating/episodic pattern** is mischaracterized as prior viral infections “come and go” ([P-15]); the Gold Answer’s fluctuating pattern is **recurrent wheezy/SOB episodes triggered by activity and resolving with rest** ([P-5], [P-6]).\n- Missing/incorrect detail: Does not mention the cough being non-productive (Gold cites [P-31]) or the nocturnal episode causing trouble falling asleep ([P-44]).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements:\n1) Timing: 4–5 days before presentation — Covered.\n2) Initial trigger: exertion/playing tag — Missed (replaced with cold weather).\n3) Early symptoms: wheeze + difficulty taking deep breaths — Partially missed (wheeze mentioned; deep-breath difficulty not stated).\n4) Fluctuating episodic pattern: recurs with activity, resolves with rest, repeats — Missed (substituted with unrelated infection history).\n5) Cough emerged later; non-productive — Partially covered (cough timing covered; non-productive not mentioned).\n6) Single nocturnal episode; self-resolved; trouble falling asleep — Partially covered (night episode + self-resolved covered; trouble falling asleep missed).\n7) Pertinent negatives (no fever, no cyanosis, well between attacks) — Missed.\nOverall: captures some endpoints (timing, cough, nocturnal episode) but omits or misstates several core progression details (trigger and episodic pattern).",
    "faithfulness": "- Mostly grounded statements: 4–5 day wheeze ([P-1]), cold weather worse ([P-38]), slight cough ([P-1]), nocturnal wheeze self-resolved ([P-43]), prior viral infections over 2 years ([P-15]).\n- Unverifiable/hallucinated element: reference to “knowledge graph linking cold air to wheezing” is not present in the transcript.\n- The main issue is misinterpretation (using [P-15] to describe the wheeze fluctuation), which affects correctness more than grounding, since [P-15] is in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "- The response is largely organized around the requested features (onset, trigger, fluctuating pattern, cough, nocturnal episode).\n- However, it introduces and emphasizes prior infections ([P-15]) as the fluctuating pattern, which is not the asked symptom trajectory and detracts from directly answering how the current respiratory episodes fluctuated.\n- Still, most content pertains to respiratory symptom development/exacerbations."
