  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the major time anchors that match the Gold Answer: onset ~3 months ago, sleep disruption ~1 month ago, productive greenish sputum beginning ~3 days ago, and subjective “hot at night” fevers in the past couple of days. No direct contradictions to the Gold Answer are present. Minor issue: it does not explicitly state the sleep disruption became nightly (“pretty well every night”), which is part of the question/Gold timeline nuance.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) onset ~3 months ago; (2) sleep disruption beginning ~1 month ago; (3) productive green/‘gunk’ sputum starting ~3 days ago; (4) subjective fevers past couple of days. Key points missed/under-specified: (a) the cough was dry and intermittent for roughly the first ~2 months (it ‘comes and goes’); (b) sleep disruption is described as essentially nightly for the last month and explicitly not for the entire 3 months; (c) the pole-dancing class context for first noticing the cough (not strictly required by the question, but part of the Gold timeline). Overall, it captures most but not all timeline detail.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by transcript citations. However, the closing sentence introduces an inference and references a “knowledge graph” and “respiratory infection” not stated in the transcript; that portion is not grounded. Also, the claim that the doctor ‘confirms’ waking up at night with citation [D-47] is a summary rather than the primary confirmation (the explicit confirmation is [P-20]/[P-21]), though [D-47] does echo it. Net: mostly grounded with minor ungrounded/inferential content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on the requested cough timeline elements (onset, nightly sleep disruption onset, onset of green sputum, onset of subjective fevers) and does not significantly drift off-topic."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate and well-focused with the correct overall timeline, but it under-specifies the nightly nature of sleep disruption and omits the earlier dry/intermittent phase detail, with a small amount of ungrounded inference."
