  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with both the source transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies Tylenol, Advil, and Alka-Seltzer as the attempted remedies, notes their lack of effectiveness, and identifies the multivitamin as the regular supplement.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the specific medications and supplements mentioned (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer, Multivitamin) and their effectiveness. However, it misses several points included in the gold answer's interpretation of 'regular routine,' such as the patient's smoking reduction efforts, stress management techniques (reading and running), and the explicit confirmation that no prescription medications are taken.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using direct quotes ('hasn't really helped very much') and correctly attributing information to the specific dialogue turns (P-6, P-25).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is extremely relevant and focused. It sticks strictly to the 'medications and supplements' requested in the prompt, avoiding the additional lifestyle context included in the gold answer."
