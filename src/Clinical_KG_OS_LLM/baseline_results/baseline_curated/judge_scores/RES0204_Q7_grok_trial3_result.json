  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the cough onset at 4-5 days [P-2] as preceding the runny nose by 2-3 days [P-11], and notes consistent severity from P-2, aligning with Gold's 'stayed the same' [P-7]. However, it omits explicit dry/non-productive details beyond initial mention, misses Gold's emphasis on no gunk [P-6] and clear discharge [P-12], and significantly errs in prior comparison by focusing on unrelated fever [P-13, not tied to prior respiratory episodes] and asthma [P-28] instead of patient's direct statement of never having a dry cough like this and prior runny noses not lasting as long [P-24]; core timeline facts correct but comparison contradictory.",
    "completeness": "Covers: cough 4-5 days first, runny nose couple days later/relative timing, consistent severity. Misses: explicit dry/non-productive throughout [P-5,P-6], stayed the same verbatim [P-7], clear discharge [P-12], progressive pattern description, key prior details (never dry cough like this, runny noses shorter duration [P-24], novel acute event). Covers ~60% of Gold key points (strong on timeline/severity, weak on details/prior).",
    "faithfulness": "Timeline and citations [P-2,P-11] verifiable; severity from P-2 grounded. Fever claim ('previous episodes...fevers [P-13]') not directly verifiable—P-13 notes general past fevers not checked this time, no prior respiratory episodes specified; asthma [P-28] verifiable but tangential. No major fabrications but some plausible stretches on prior 'episodes'; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses timeline, relative timing/duration of cough vs runny nose, severity stability, and prior comparison; minor tangents in fever/asthma but overall focused on question without off-topic content."
