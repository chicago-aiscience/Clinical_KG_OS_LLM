  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript contains only patient statements (P-1 to P-35) with no doctor statements (D-xx), but the transcript includes full doctor-patient dialogue up to D-38. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer, which accurately cites D-37 and D-38 detailing the next steps (consulting another doctor, returning to discuss tests and plan). No facts match; entirely erroneous.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: doctor will review info with 'the doctor who's working today' (collaborative decision-making), return shortly to discuss next steps/tests/management plan (D-37/D-38), no specific tests ordered, patient agreement (P-37). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead fabricating absence of doctor input.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that 'there are no doctor statements' despite the transcript having 38 D utterances, including the critical D-37 where next steps are communicated. No claims are verifiable; purely fabricated misreading of the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question by claiming insufficient data but fails to do so accurately due to erroneous transcript analysis, providing irrelevant summary of patient symptoms instead of doctor communication; largely off-topic from actual content."
