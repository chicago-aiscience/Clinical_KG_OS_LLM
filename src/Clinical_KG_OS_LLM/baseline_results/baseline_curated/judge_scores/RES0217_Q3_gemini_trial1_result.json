{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly accurate regarding the duration of attachment, the activities (hiking/gardening), and the prior history of a tick bite. However, it misinterprets 'Geographic Risk Assessment' by discussing the tick species (D-5) rather than the specific geographic location and the doctor's map check mentioned in the transcript (D-12, D-13).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific location of 'Strathroy along the creek'; 2) The doctor's consultation of the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map; and 3) The patient's specific mention that they heard all ticks in that area are now considered potential carriers, which specifically addresses why they would proceed despite the visual mismatch.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript and does not contain hallucinations. The points it does mention are well-supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's requirements, though the geographic section is less focused on geography than the Gold Answer."
