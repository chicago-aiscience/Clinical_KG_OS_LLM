  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient's current statin therapy for cholesterol (consistent with Gold [P-14, P-15]) and the proposal for prophylactic antibiotics due to potential >72-hour attachment (consistent with Gold [D-6, D-18]). It includes correct citations from the transcript. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer; minor inference of 'high cholesterol' aligns with context, and knowledge graph references are extra but do not misstate facts present in Gold/transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: current statin for cholesterol management (100%), prophylactic antibiotics proposed with >72h reasoning and 'safer' quote (about 70%). Missed: past tick bite antibiotic treatment [P-3], denial of allergies [P-16, P-17], no specific antibiotic details, plan to consult physician [D-13, D-22], environmental insecticide suggestion [D-18]. Covers approximately 50-70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about statin and prophylactic antibiotics are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-14,15; D-6,18]. However, references to a 'knowledge graph' (e.g., statin--[TAKEN_FOR]--> high cholesterol; prophylactic antibiotics--[TAKEN_FOR]--> Lyme) and 'provided knowledge graph' are entirely fabricated—not present in transcript or Gold Answer—introducing multiple hallucinated elements, though the underlying facts are plausible and grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around current statin therapy and proposed prophylactic antibiotics for the tick bite, with a focused summary and no off-topic content."
