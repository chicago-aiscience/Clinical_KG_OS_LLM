  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 (phrased as 'Covid' or COVID-19) as the alternative diagnosis to exclude due to symptom overlap with COPD exacerbation, specifies the COVID swab as the test, and states the turnaround time as 24 to 48 hours, matching the Gold Answer exactly with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), reason (symptom overlap with COPD exacerbation), specific test (COVID swab), expected turnaround time (24-48 hours), and citations ([D-52]). No key points missed; extra details in Gold (e.g., specific symptoms) are not required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript: 'symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid', 'covid swab', 'hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours'. Citations are accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question (alternative diagnosis, test, turnaround time) with no off-topic content or tangents."
