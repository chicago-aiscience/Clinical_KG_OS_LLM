{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains mostly accurate information but underrepresents the duration of the cough (stating 'at least a month' when the transcript and Gold Answer specify three months). It correctly identifies the characteristics of the sputum and the subjective fever.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is significantly incomplete. It misses the initial dry/intermittent nature of the cough and the specific context of onset (pole dancing class). Most importantly, the prompt specifically asked for symptoms the patient 'explicitly denied'; the Generated Answer only lists two (pain and blood), whereas the Gold Answer and transcript list many more: night sweats, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript. The details provided (greenish gunk, sleep disturbance, subjective fever, fatigue) are all grounded in the provided text without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is directly relevant to the question, addressing all parts of the multi-part prompt (respiratory symptoms, sputum characteristics, and denied symptoms), even though the coverage of the latter part is sparse."
