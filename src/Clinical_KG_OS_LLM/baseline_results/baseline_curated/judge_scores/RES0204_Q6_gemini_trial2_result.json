{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the two planned diagnostic tests (Chest X-ray and COVID-19 swab) and the intent to consult with a supervising physician. It accurately describes the rationale for these tests as standard procedure or to see inside the body.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key components of the 'complete plan' mentioned in the transcript and Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the initial physical examination of the patient's lungs and heart mentioned in [D-1]. It also fails to specify the immediate follow-up step of the doctor returning with the supervising physician to discuss the next steps after arranging the tests, focusing instead on the long-term goal of returning to health.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The descriptions of the X-ray as a 'picture of the body on the inside' and the mention of 'Rollercoaster Tycoon' are directly supported by the text. Citations are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant to the question, focusing specifically on the doctor's plan, tests, and consultation, without introducing unrelated information."
