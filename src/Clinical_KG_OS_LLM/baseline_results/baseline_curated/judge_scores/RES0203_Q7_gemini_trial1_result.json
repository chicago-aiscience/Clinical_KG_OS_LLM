  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the patient's history. It states there is 'no evidence' in the transcript that the patient encountered these symptoms before and cites [P-33] (alcohol consumption) as a response to health history. However, the transcript explicitly shows the doctor asking if the patient had these symptoms before [D-3] and the patient responding 'No, no, nothing like this' [P-3]. Additionally, it misses the explicit confirmation that the cough started at the same time as the sensory loss [P-6].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer: the simultaneous onset of all three symptoms, the specific details of partial sensory loss (smelling bad odors/tasting salt), and the explicit mention that the symptoms were 'pretty consistent' (the Generated Answer says there was 'no indication' they fluctuated, rather than confirming they were consistent).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a lack of evidence for prior symptoms ('no evidence in the transcript') despite the transcript containing a direct question and answer on this topic at [D-3/P-3]. It also misattributes the dialogue flow by suggesting [P-33] was a response to general health history in the context of prior symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's prompts regarding timing, progression, and prior history, but the inaccuracies regarding the prior history and the omission of simultaneous onset reduce its effectiveness in answering how the symptoms developed over time relative to one another."
