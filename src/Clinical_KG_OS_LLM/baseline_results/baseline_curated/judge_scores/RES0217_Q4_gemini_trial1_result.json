  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer. It correctly identifies the clinical features assessed (bullseye rash, joint pain, fever, headaches) and their absence, as well as the proposed diagnostic tests (tick identification, blood serology, physical exam).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the majority of the key points. It misses the specific detail about the doctor confirming the patient was 'feeling well otherwise' and the check for other bites on the body. It also omits the mention of consulting a supervising physician as part of the clinical plan, which was included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. It mentions 'Ixodes species' which is not explicitly in the transcript (the transcript says 'deer tick'), likely pulling from the 'knowledge graph' mentioned in its preamble, but this is a minor detail that aligns with the context.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses the two parts of the question: clinical features assessed/absent and proposed diagnostic tests."
