{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition as a 'respiratory infection', which aligns with the Gold Answer's more specific 'acute lower respiratory tract infection'. It correctly maps the clinical features to the diagnosis. However, it repeatedly references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the provided source material.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all three clinical features (productive cough, sputum color, and subjective fever) requested in the question. It misses some of the deeper clinical reasoning provided in the Gold Answer, such as the significance of the 3-month cough history representing a transition from irritation to inflammation, and the importance of negative findings (no weight loss/night sweats) in narrowing the diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer attributes its reasoning to a 'Knowledge Graph' multiple times. This 'Knowledge Graph' is not part of the source transcript provided. While the clinical logic is sound, the attribution is a hallucination of the source material's context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's multi-part question, explaining how each feature contributes to the diagnosis."
