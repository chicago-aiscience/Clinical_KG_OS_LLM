  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the sequence of events (seizure at night, woke up with shortness of breath/cough, temperature check, and seeking care). The factual details regarding the temperature (37.4) and medication (Keppra) are correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer: 1) The specific context of the daughter's birthday/dinner disruption as the reason for the missed dose [P-24]. 2) The specific timeframe of symptoms starting three hours prior to consultation [P-11]. 3) The patient's comparative history of never having felt SOB before [P-3]. 4) The patient's uncertainty regarding the link between the seizure and respiratory symptoms [P-8].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer mentions a 'knowledge graph provided' which was not part of the source context; this is a hallucination of external structure. However, the clinical facts extracted from the transcript itself are faithful to the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the four specific timeline items requested in the prompt (seizure, respiratory onset, temperature, and care decision)."
