  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies partial loss of smell and mild cough but erroneously states the loss of taste as 'apparent complete loss,' contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [P-4] which specifies partial loss (can taste very salty foods but not normal items like banana). It misses duration (two days), consistency, cough being dry/non-productive, onset timing, and specific perceptual details, leading to significant factual discrepancies with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: symptoms (smell partial, taste loss, mild cough) - partial coverage; Missed: duration (two days), consistency over time, smell details (really bad odors), taste details (salty yes, banana no), cough dry/no sputum/blood/same onset/no triggers. Covers approximately 25-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in [P-1] for basic symptoms, but 'complete loss' of taste is not verifiable in full transcript ([P-4] states partial for both senses); misses 'dry' from same [P-1] citation; specific details absent despite being in transcript; one major ungrounded degree interpretation and omissions indicate multiple issues.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists sensory (smell, taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms with degrees of severity, matching the question's focus without any off-topic content."
