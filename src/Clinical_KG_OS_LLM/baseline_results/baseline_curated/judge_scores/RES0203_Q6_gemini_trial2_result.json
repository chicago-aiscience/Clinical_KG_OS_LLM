{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it states the transcript does not mention a plan to consult a supervising physician, when the doctor explicitly says 'we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today' [D-40]. It also fails to mention the possibility of 'additional tests' which was a requirement of the prompt and present in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two key components requested in the prompt: any mention of additional tests and the plan to consult with a supervising physician (which it incorrectly claims is missing). It covers the assessment, the COVID test method, self-care, and the timeline well.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinations the absence of a detail that is clearly present in the transcript. Claiming the transcript does not contain information that is actually at [D-40] is a failure of faithfulness to the source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in its structure, attempting to address every specific point requested by the prompt, even though it fails to find the information for some of those points."
