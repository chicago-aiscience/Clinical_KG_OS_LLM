  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the doctor's plan including the consultation with the supervising physician, the two diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID-19 swab), and their explanations, matching the Gold Answer's facts on these points. Minor discrepancies include not mentioning the physical exam of lungs and heart as part of the initial plan [D-1], overstating the tests as definitively 'arranged' or 'will proceed' when the transcript uses tentative language like 'might want' and 'should probably do', and not explicitly detailing the follow-up return with the supervising doctor to discuss next steps. Core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: consultation with supervising physician [D-37], chest X-ray [D-37], COVID-19 swab [D-39], age-appropriate explanations and reassurance [D-39]. Partially covered: overall plan structure and follow-up to return and discuss next steps [D-1, D-40]. Missed: explicit mention of chatting and examining lungs/heart before consultation [D-1], patient/mother acknowledgment [P-40], and concluding thanks [D-41, D-42]. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: consultation [D-37, D-40], chest X-ray purpose and description [D-37, D-39], COVID swab as standard and discomfort [D-39], reassurance on bravery [D-39], goal of returning to health [D-37]. Citations are accurate [D-37, D-39]. No hallucinations; all content grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly focused on describing the doctor's plan, structuring it around consultation, diagnostic tests, and communication elements directly addressing the question's requirements for tests, consultation, and follow-up steps communicated to patient/mother. No off-topic content."
