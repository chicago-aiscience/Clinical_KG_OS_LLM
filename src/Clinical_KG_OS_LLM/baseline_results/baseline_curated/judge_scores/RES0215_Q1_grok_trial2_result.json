  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the main respiratory symptoms (wheezing, cough, shortness of breath/difficulty taking deep breaths) reported at presentation, matching the Gold Answer's core symptoms from [P-1] and [P-2]. It correctly notes wheezing as an early symptom from [P-2] and cough as more recent from phrasing in [P-1]. Minor discrepancies include not explicitly listing both 'wheezing AND difficulty taking deep breaths' as the earliest per Gold [P-2], omitting details like activity-related out-of-breath [P-3], non-productive cough [P-31], hard time catching breath without cyanosis [P-32], but no major errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: three main symptoms at presentation (wheezy, short of breath, slight cough) [P-1]; earliest symptoms including wheezing [P-2]; cough more recent [P-1]. Partially covers difficulty taking deep breaths under SOB. Missed: specific activity example (playing tag) [P-3], episode details (hard time catching breath, no cyanosis) [P-32], non-productive cough [P-31], 'looks fine otherwise' [P-9]. Covers ~85% of key points, focusing on core symptoms and timeline.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable: wheezing in [P-1], [P-2], [P-43]; cough in [P-1]; shortness of breath/difficulty deep breaths in [P-1], [P-2]; earliest wheezing per [P-2] response to [D-2]; cough recent from [P-1] phrasing. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists the specific respiratory symptoms reported at presentation in bullet points with citations and explicitly addresses the earliest symptoms (wheezy breathing) with timeline, perfectly matching the question without off-topic content."
