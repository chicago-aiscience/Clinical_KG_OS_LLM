No factual errors or contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all five key components requested: (1) diagnostic tests ordered (chest X-ray and COVID swab), (2) physical examination planned (chest examination), (3) self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife), (4) expected timeline (24-48 hours), and (5) criteria for admission/discharge decision (based on test results).
