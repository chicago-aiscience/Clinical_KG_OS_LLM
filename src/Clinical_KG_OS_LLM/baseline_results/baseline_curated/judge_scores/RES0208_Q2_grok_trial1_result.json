  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists two current medications: Avodart for enlarged prostate (BPH) and Tums for reflux. Generated Answer only mentions Tums for reflux, completely omitting Avodart and its condition, which is a significant factual error and contradiction. The reflux change is accurately described, but the core list of current medications is incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Avodart (dutasteride) for BPH [P-25,P-26]; Tums for reflux [P-27]; stopped previous reflux med after figuring out foods [P-27]; doctor's positive response [D-28]; no allergies [P-28]. Generated covers Tums for reflux and the reflux change (why), but misses Avodart entirely, doctor's response, and allergies. Covers ~50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Tums for reflux verified in [P-27]; change to regimen (stopped prev med, figured out foods) verified in [P-27]. Slight paraphrase ('foods causing issues' vs. 'foods that were going to help') is minor. '[Knowledge Graph]' is an unverifiable hallucination not in transcript. No other fabrications, but omission of Avodart doesn't count as hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses current medications (partially), conditions, and the reflux regimen change with reason, staying focused on the question without off-topic content."
