  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant errors and omissions. It fails to specify that all three symptoms began simultaneously, which is explicitly confirmed in P-6. It misses the critical detail that symptoms remained 'pretty consistent' without worsening (P-5, P-8). Most importantly, it completely misrepresents the patient's prior history by citing P-33 (about alcohol), when the correct response about never experiencing similar symptoms is in P-3 ('No, no, nothing like this').",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only about 40-50% of key points. It mentions the two-day duration and general timing but omits: (1) simultaneous onset confirmed in P-6, (2) consistency of symptoms over time from P-5 and P-8, (3) partial nature of sensory losses (P-4), (4) clear statement about no prior similar episodes from P-3. The answer also fails to synthesize the clinical significance of these findings.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major hallucination. It claims P-33 relates to symptom history when P-33 is actually about alcohol consumption ('I have drank alcohol before but not not regularly'). This is a serious misattribution. The rest is grounded in the transcript but imprecise - for example, it vaguely states 'no specific indication' about worsening when the transcript explicitly states symptoms were 'pretty consistent.'",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the core question about symptom timeline but does so superficially. It mentions when symptoms began and attempts to address prior history, which is relevant. However, it fails to adequately address whether symptoms worsened or fluctuated (a key part of the question), providing only vague statements rather than specific findings from the transcript."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the basic timeline but contains serious flaws including a major citation error (referencing P-33 for symptom history instead of P-3), omission of key details about simultaneous onset and symptom consistency, and failure to capture the partial nature of sensory losses. The answer covers less than half of the Gold Answer's key points and misrepresents transcript content."
