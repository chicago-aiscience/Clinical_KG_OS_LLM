  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer accurately cites transcript evidence showing the doctor explored living situation (D-45/P-45: apartment in city alone), environmental triggers (D-46/P-46: carpets, dust, mold, etc., denied), sick contacts (D-47/P-47: mostly home, possible work lunchroom), workplace (D-48/P-48: car dealership; D-50/P-50: no one sick noticed), and travel (D-49/P-49: none). The Generated Answer falsely claims the doctor 'did **not systematically explore**' these exact areas, asserting no specific inquiries were made and only smoking (D-42) was probed, which is a complete factual contradiction with no alignment to Gold Answer's facts. Score: 1",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: post-P-38 confirmation, living (apartment alone), env triggers denied, sick contacts (home/work lunch), workplace (car dealership, no sick colleagues), travel denied, substance screening, no clear source. Generated Answer covers 0% of these points, instead denying all explorations occurred. Score: 1",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims 'no specific inquiries' into exposures and 'only background... smoking [D-42]' are not verifiable and directly contradicted by D-45 (living), D-46 (env), D-47 (sick contacts), D-48/P-48 (workplace), D-49 (travel), D-50 (sick at work). Misinterprets D-52 contact tracing as non-inquiry. Multiple hallucinated absences of transcript content. Score: 1",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by explicitly denying systematic exploration of the listed categories (living, workplace, travel, sick contacts), mirroring the query's phrasing, with minor tangents on symptoms (e.g., cough P-12, smell P-24) and COVID suspicion (D-52) that relate to infection context. Score: 4"
