  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies initial symptoms (headache and cough 4 days ago) matching Gold [P-1]. GI symptoms timed as 'few days back' aligns with P-1 but lacks Gold's precision (diarrhea 2 days ago [P-28], vomiting yesterday [P-32]). Loss of smell 1 day ago correct [P-24]. Headache described as persistent with location correct [P-3,P-5], but omits stability ('stayed the same' [P-9]), 7/10 severity [P-8], and atypical nature [P-10]. Cough noted as dry and 'remained present' [P-12], but misses explicit stability ('around the same' [P-11]). No major contradictions, minor omissions/discrepancies in detail.",
    "completeness": "Covers: initial symptoms (headache/cough 4 days ago), GI timing vaguely ('few days back'), loss of smell (1 day), headache persistence/location, cough dry/present. Misses from Gold: headache severity 7/10/stable/atypical, cough stability explicit, precise GI (diarrhea 2 days/5-6x, vomiting yesterday 2x food/nausea today), negatives (no fever, no resp worsening). Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: initial [P-1], GI vague but from [P-1], smell [P-24], headache persistent/location [P-3,P-5], cough dry [P-12]. 'Remained present' infers from context [P-11] without fabrication. No hallucinations; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around question elements: initial symptoms, GI/loss of smell timing relative to onset, headache/cough status over time. No irrelevant content; perfectly focused despite some detail gaps."
