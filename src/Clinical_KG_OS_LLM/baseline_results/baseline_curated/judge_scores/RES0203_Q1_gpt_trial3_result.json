  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the three relevant symptoms (smell change, taste change, cough) and correctly characterizes smell loss as partial. However, it incorrectly states the taste loss was complete; the transcript clarifies taste was partial (could taste very salty foods but not normal flavors like banana). It also omits that the cough was specifically described as dry/non-productive (though it does call it mild). Overall, there is a meaningful factual error regarding the degree of taste loss.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) decreased smell for 2 days, partial—can smell very bad/strong odors; (2) decreased taste for 2 days, partial—can taste very salty foods but not normal foods (banana example); (3) mild dry cough for 2 days, started same time as sensory symptoms; (4) cough non-productive/no sputum or blood; (5) symptoms consistent over two days (not intermittent); (6) no cough triggers identified. Generated Answer includes only: the three symptoms, partial smell (without the specific preserved perception details), and mild cough (without dry/non-productive details, timing, consistency, or triggers). Thus it covers well under half of the Gold Answer’s key details and misses the patient’s specific “could/could not perceive” descriptions.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in [P-1], but the claim of a “complete” loss of taste is not supported by the full transcript and conflicts with the patient’s later clarification [P-4]. The answer also ignores transcript details that qualify symptoms (partial taste loss, dry/non-productive cough), reducing faithfulness to the encounter as a whole.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked sensory and respiratory symptoms and attempts to describe degree. However, it fails to include the requested patient-provided details about what they could still smell/taste and misstates the degree of taste loss, so it only partially satisfies the question."
