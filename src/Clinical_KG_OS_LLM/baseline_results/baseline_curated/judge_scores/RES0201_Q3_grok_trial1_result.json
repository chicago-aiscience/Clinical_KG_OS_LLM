  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the doctor explicitly linked sore throat and difficulty breathing as the specific symptoms for COVID-19 suspicion, whereas the Gold Answer and transcript [D-43] state 'some of your symptoms' without specifying. It fabricates a 'loss of smell' when the patient reported 'maybe taste a little bit but not smell' [P-19], directly contradicting the Gold Answer and question's emphasis on reduced taste WITHOUT loss of smell. Introduces a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' linking symptoms to diagnosis. Omits fatigue/muscle aches and exposure details. These are significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered partially: doctor's statement [D-43] (misrepresented), sore throat, difficulty breathing, reduced taste [P-19]. Missed: sore throat progression (4 days, worsening) [P-2,P-4], dyspnea details (new-onset yesterday, constant, worsening) [P-8-P-10], taste details (2 days, persistent) [P-20,P-21], fatigue/muscle aches [P-25,P-26], doctor's screening [D-19], exposure (grocery/bank [P-12], no contacts/travel [P-12,P-13]), immunizations [P-14]. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: quotes [D-43] and [P-19] accurately, sore throat/dyspnea from transcript. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'loss of smell' (opposite of transcript), 'Knowledge Graph' (absent), 'patient admitted to loss of smell', diagnostic criteria fulfillment (not in transcript). Multiple hallucinations undermine grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom combination for COVID-19 suspicion and role of reduced taste (though misstates smell), structures response around clinical reasoning, with minor off-topic fabrication (Knowledge Graph)."
