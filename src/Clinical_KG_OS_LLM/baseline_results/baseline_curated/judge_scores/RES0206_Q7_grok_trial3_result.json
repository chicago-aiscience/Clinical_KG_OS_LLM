  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript on baseline (manageable with puffers/inhalers [P-1,P-26], lifestyle efforts), symptom evolution (worsening cough, green sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea [P-1], fever [P-9], exercise impact [P-4]), and overall worsening. It correctly infers decompensation but omits explicit patient quote on progressive worsening [P-2] and adds minor extras like smoking history [P-40] and doctor's summary [D-43], which are accurate but not central to Gold. No contradictions, just minor discrepancies in emphasis. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Covered: baseline manageability with puffers/inhalers/lifestyle [P-1,P-26,P-23]; 3-day symptoms (worsening cough/SOB/green sputum/hemoptysis/fever [P-1,P-9]); exercise decline [P-4]; implication of worsening. Missed: explicit progression 'getting a little worse, definitely haven't gotten better' [P-2]; daily dog walks as baseline activity detail [P-4]; 'worst that I've had' [P-3]; prior episodes worsened by illness/cough 'pretty bad' [P-3]; 2 ED visits/3 years, no hospitalizations [P-5,P-6]. Covers ~70% of key points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1] for worsening symptoms, [P-26] inhalers, [P-9] fever, [P-40] smoking). Doctor's characterization [D-43] matches transcript exactly. No hallucinations; inferences like 'decompensation' and symptom differentiation grounded in reported facts. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured with sections on baseline, 3-day evolution (including worsening implication), and severity comparison to baseline/typical exacerbations, directly addressing all question elements without off-topic content. Smoking history is relevant context. Score: 5"
