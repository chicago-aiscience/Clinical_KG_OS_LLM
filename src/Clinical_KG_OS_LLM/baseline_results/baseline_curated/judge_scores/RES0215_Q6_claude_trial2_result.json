  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three-step plan (physical exam, consultation with physician, discussion of next steps) from [D-58]. However, it significantly understates the environmental assessment. The Gold Answer details five environmental factors assessed: smoking (denied), carpets (new, 6 months ago), pets (denied), wood-burning fireplaces/stoves (denied), and air filter changes (confirmed). The Generated Answer only mentions carpets, omitting four other critical environmental factors explicitly discussed in [D-53] through [D-57]. This represents a factual incompleteness rather than an error in what is stated.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the immediate plan adequately but fails to capture the comprehensive environmental assessment. It mentions only 1 of 5 environmental factors explicitly assessed (carpets), missing smoking status, pets, wood-burning appliances, and air filter maintenance. It also omits contextual details like the townhouse setting [P-50] and household composition [P-49] mentioned in the Gold Answer. The answer covers approximately 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The three-step plan is accurately cited from [D-58], and the carpet detail is correctly referenced from [P-54]. However, the answer is incomplete rather than unfaithful—it doesn't hallucinate information but rather fails to include all relevant environmental factors that were discussed in [D-53] through [D-57]. The citations provided are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the doctor's stated plan for immediate next steps and environmental factors assessed. However, it provides an incomplete answer to the environmental factors portion. The content is relevant and focused, with no off-topic information, but it doesn't fully satisfy the question's scope."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's three-step plan (physical exam, physician consultation, follow-up discussion) but significantly under-represents the environmental assessment. While it accurately mentions carpets, it omits four other environmental factors explicitly assessed (smoking, pets, wood-burning appliances, air filters) and contextual details (townhouse, household composition). All stated information is accurate and grounded in the transcript, but the answer covers only about 40-50% of the key points, particularly failing in the completeness of the environmental factors assessment."
