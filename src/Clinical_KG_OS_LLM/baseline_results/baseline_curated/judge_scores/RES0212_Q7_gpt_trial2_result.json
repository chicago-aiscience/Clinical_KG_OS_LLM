  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies: (1) cough onset ~3 months ago (consistent with P-2/P-13), (2) sleep disruption beginning ~1 month ago (consistent with P-19/P-21), (3) productive cough with greenish sputum starting ~3 days prior (consistent with P-2/P-9/P-12), and (4) subjective nighttime “hot” feelings/fevers starting in the past couple of days (P-4). No major timeline elements contradict the Gold Answer. Minor issue: it does not explicitly state that awakenings were “pretty well every night,” though it does date sleep disruption to ~1 month.",
    "completeness": "It covers the four timeline milestones asked in the question (first appearance, sleep disruption onset, green/productive onset, subjective fever onset). However, it omits several clarifying Gold Answer details: the initial onset context (pole dancing class), the characterization of the first ~2 months as dry/intermittent, and the explicit “pretty well every night” wording and the clarification that it was not nightly for the full 3 months.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript and the cited turns are appropriate. The main ungrounded elements are references to a “knowledge graph” and the added interpretive statement that this ‘aligns with’/is ‘indicated by’ a respiratory infection in that knowledge graph—these are not present in the transcript and go beyond what was asked.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the requested cough timeline and directly addresses all queried timepoints. There is a minor tangent about infection/knowledge graph, but it does not substantially detract from answering the timeline question."
