  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual inaccuracies compared to the Gold Answer and transcript: it incorrectly states that the chronic cough onset 'does not specify the exact date or duration' despite [P-3] explicitly stating 'probably had a cough for the last 10 years'; it reports COPD diagnosis as 'a couple years ago' [P-1] without noting the clarification to 'almost, probably five years ago' [P-2] as in Gold; recent worsening of cough/sputum (past week) and SOB (few days) match Gold and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: worsening cough and sputum change past week, SOB intensification last few days (covers ~60%); missed: chronic cough 10 years [P-3], COPD diagnosis 5 years with clarification [P-2], intermittent baseline SOB [P-8], chills last couple days [P-29].",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded (e.g., past week cough [P-1,P-5], sputum [P-6], SOB few days [P-8]); however, 'transcript does not specify' chronic cough duration is false as [P-3] provides 'last 10 years'; COPD only cites initial [P-1] ignoring [P-2]; minor addition of doctor's diagnosis [D-52] is verifiable but not central; some misrepresentation of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures a timeline addressing the exact question elements (chronic cough onset, COPD dx, cough/sputum worsening, acute SOB), with bullet points perfectly focused despite inaccuracies."
