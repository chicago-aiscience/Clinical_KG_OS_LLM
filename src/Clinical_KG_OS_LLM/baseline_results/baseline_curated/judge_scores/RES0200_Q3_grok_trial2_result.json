  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (worsening cough from P-1, sputum changes from P-6, increased dyspnea from P-1) matching the Gold Answer's core facts, correctly cites the doctor's assessment in D-52 linking worsening symptoms to COPD history; minor discrepancies include not specifying COPD duration (5 years, P-2), inhaler use (P-11), or fuller symptom details (e.g., cough triggers in P-5, dyspnea severity in P-8), but no contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points: three symptoms (worsening cough, sputum changes, increased dyspnea) with citations; doctor's synthesis of worsening chronic symptoms in context of COPD history (D-52); misses finer details like cough frequency/exertional triggers (P-5), precise dyspnea progression (P-8), COPD timeline (P-2), and inhalers (P-11), covering ~85% of Gold's content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: exact quotes/paraphrases from P-1, P-6, D-52 accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details (minor mention of 'knowledge graph' not impacting content, as all sourced from transcript).",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by structuring response around exact symptom combination (worsening cough, sputum changes, dyspnea) plus COPD history and doctor's explicit linking logic in D-52; no off-topic content."
