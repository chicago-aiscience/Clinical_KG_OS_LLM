  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all major clinical features assessed (bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/systemic illness, headaches) and accurately reports they were found absent. It correctly identifies the three diagnostic tests proposed (tick identification, serology, physical exam). The facts align with the Gold Answer without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 90% of the Gold Answer's key points. It includes all major assessed symptoms and all three diagnostic tests. However, it omits some supporting details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the specific denial responses from the patient for each symptom, (2) the doctor's confirmation that patient was 'feeling well otherwise,' (3) the patient's affirmative response as 'totally fine,' (4) mention that patient checked herself and husband for other bites, (5) the detail about consulting a supervising physician, and (6) the note that no test results were available during consultation. These are supplementary details rather than core content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The citations provided ([D-6], [P-6], [D-7], [D-8], [D-19], [D-18]) are accurate. The mention of 'Ixodes species' appears to be an inference from the doctor's description of 'deer tick' but is medically accurate and not contradicted by the transcript. No hallucinated content is present. The reference to 'provided knowledge graph' suggests context outside the transcript but doesn't introduce false information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) specific clinical features assessed and found absent, and (2) diagnostic tests proposed. The content is well-organized under clear headings that map to the question structure. No irrelevant information is included. The answer is focused and complete."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-structured response that correctly identifies all major clinical features assessed for active Lyme disease (bullseye rash, joint pain, fever, headaches) and the three proposed diagnostic tests (tick identification, serology, physical exam). All information is faithful to the transcript with accurate citations. The answer loses minor points on completeness for omitting supplementary details like specific patient responses, the mention of checking for other bites, and the plan to consult a supervising physician, but these omissions don't affect the core accuracy or relevance of the response."
