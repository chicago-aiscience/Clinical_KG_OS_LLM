  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states assessment as viral infectious process consistent with COVID-19 ('symptoms align with COVID', 'sounds like an infection') [D-44,D-45], which Generated matches by saying 'infection' [D-45] and 'symptoms consistent with COVID-19' [D-44], including fever ruling out asthma [D-45]. Test, TAT, isolation period (14 days), false negatives, alternative diagnosis (another viral illness), and warning signs all match exactly. Minor discrepancy: Generated omits 'including from younger sister if possible' in isolation [D-44]; also doesn't explicitly state no medications/watchful waiting, but core facts are correct. No contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) assessment (COVID-like viral infection) - covered; (2) COVID swab 24-48h - covered; (3) 14-day isolation including sister - partially (misses sister); (4) false-negative possibility - covered; (5) alt dx another viral illness - covered; (6) warning signs (high temp, neuro/seizures, weak/dizzy, fainting) - fully covered; (7) asthma note if no fever - covered; (8) no meds, watchful waiting - implied but not explicit. Covers ~90% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from transcript: test/TAT/isolation/false neg/alt dx/warning signs/asthma note all cite [D-44]/[D-45] accurately. No unverifiable or hallucinated details; 'strict' isolation is reasonable paraphrase of context. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around question elements (test/TAT, assessment, isolation, alt possibilities/false neg, red flags) with clear headings, no tangents or off-topic content. Perfectly addresses the clinical question."
