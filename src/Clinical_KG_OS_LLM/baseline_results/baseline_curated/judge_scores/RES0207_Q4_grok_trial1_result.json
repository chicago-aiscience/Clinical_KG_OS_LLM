  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that chest pain was screened for and denied (from [D-7, P-7]), and links it to cardiac differentials, which aligns partially with the Gold Answer's mention of chest pain for cardiac causes. However, it has significant factual errors: incorrect citation of [P-34] (smoking denial) and misquotes the patient's response as 'I don't, no' which is not from the chest pain question (P-7 is simply 'No'). It ignores all other symptoms and only partially matches Gold's cardiac inference, leading to contradictions in completeness and evidence.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: denied chest pain, feeling faint (cardiac); loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel (infectious); nausea/vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea (GI); dry cough/no sputum; no prior episodes. Generated covers only chest pain (one point) and cardiac inference, missing 90+% of points including all infectious, GI, exposures, and other cardiac symptoms. Covers <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Chest pain denial is verifiable in [D-7, P-7], shortness of breath from [P-1] is accurate, and cardiac rule-out is plausible interpretation. However, hallucinates wrong quote ('I don't, no') and citation [P-34] which is unrelated (smoking). Other claims like standard procedure for cardiac are not directly in transcript but plausible; overall multiple inaccuracies in grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses part of the question by listing one denied symptom (chest pain) and linking to cardiac differential, with no off-topic content, but narrowly focused on only one aspect instead of the full scope of symptoms/exposures and multiple differentials."
