  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three main symptoms (partial loss of smell, loss of taste, mild dry cough) but inaccurately describes the loss of taste as 'apparent complete loss' based only on [P-1], contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [P-4] which specifies partial loss (can taste really salty foods but not normal items like banana). It also omits duration (two days), consistency, and detailed perceptions for smell/taste, and full cough details (dry, non-productive, onset timing). This represents significant factual errors/contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: identification of sensory symptoms (smell partial, taste loss) and respiratory symptom (mild dry cough) from [P-1]. Missed: duration of two days [P-2]; smell details (not totally gone, can smell really bad odors) [P-4]; taste details (can taste really salty foods, cannot taste banana/normal things) [P-4]; consistency of sensory symptoms [P-5]; cough details (dry/non-productive/no sputum/blood [P-7], same onset [P-6], consistent severity [P-8], no triggers [P-21]). Covers ~30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in [P-1] with accurate citations and quotes ('can't smell things as well', 'seem to have lost my sense of taste', 'mild dry cough'). However, 'apparent complete loss' of taste is not verifiable as complete per full transcript [P-4 clarifies partial], representing a plausible but selective interpretation; no outright hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists the requested symptoms with degrees of severity and cites transcript, perfectly matching the question's focus on sensory/respiratory symptoms, partial vs. complete loss, and perception details (though incomplete). No off-topic content."
