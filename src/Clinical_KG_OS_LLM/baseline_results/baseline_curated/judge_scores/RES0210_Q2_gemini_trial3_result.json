  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for cholesterol. However, it incorrectly states that no over-the-counter (OTC) medications were mentioned. The Gold Answer and transcript [P-14] explicitly mention Tylenol (acetaminophen) and its effectiveness ('helps a little bit'). The Generated Answer also misses the non-medication relief (clearing 'gunk') mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two out of the three main components regarding medications: it fails to identify the OTC medication (Tylenol) and fails to report its effectiveness. It also misses the supplemental information about expectoration providing relief.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims that the transcript does not mention any specific OTC medications. This is unfaithful to the source text, as [P-14] explicitly names 'Tylenol'. While the transcript text contains a likely ASR error ('haven't' vs 'have'), the medication is named and its effectiveness is described, which the Generated Answer ignores entirely.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing the categories requested in the prompt (Prescribed, OTC, Effectiveness)."
