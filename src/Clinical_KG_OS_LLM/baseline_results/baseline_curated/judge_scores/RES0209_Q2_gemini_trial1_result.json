  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medication (bronchodilator) and administration (puffer). However, it fails significantly on the third part of the question. It incorrectly claims the transcript does not contain dialogue about a daily controller, whereas D-5 explicitly asks 'do you have one that you take every day no matter what?'. It also incorrectly applies the patient's statement about not being formally diagnosed with allergies (P-12) to their asthma, which was diagnosed at age 8 (P-2).",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the current medication and its administration. However, it fails to describe the specific type of daily controller the doctor asked about, instead claiming the information is missing from the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a major hallucination by claiming the doctor did not ask about a daily controller medication when this occurred in exchange D-5/P-5. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source transcript. It misattributes the quote about formal diagnosis (P-12) to asthma when it was about allergies.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address all parts of the question, but the final section is largely irrelevant or incorrect due to the failure to find the specific dialogue requested."
