  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the three triggers with correct citations matching Gold and transcript (exercise P-9, cold air P-9/P-11, pollen P-11). It correctly notes increased bronchodilator use, symptoms of exacerbation, family history of sister's asthma (P-32), and links pollen to allergy suspicion. Minor discrepancies: cites P-1 for increased use instead of precise P-8 frequencies; infers allergy suspicion from pollen without Gold's specific clinician dialogue (D-12/13/31); introduces non-existent 'knowledge graph' references; states 'clinical suspicion of asthma' despite prior diagnosis at age 8, but core facts align with Gold's emphasis on exacerbation context and allergy suspicion.",
    "completeness": "Covers: all three triggers; link to exacerbation via symptoms and increased inhaler use; pollen-allergy connection; family history (sister's asthma). Misses: patient reports no other triggers (P-10); detailed clinician allergy probing and 'that would make sense' (D-12/13/31); no other family allergies/breathing issues (P-33/34); exact inhaler frequency shift (P-8); clinician's medication change suggestion indicating insufficient rescue therapy (D-43). Covers ~85% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable in transcript (triggers P-9/11, symptoms P-1/15, family P-32, increased use P-1/8). Accurate citations where provided. Hallucinations: repeated 'knowledge graph' references linking pollen/family to allergies/asthma (not in transcript); minor overstatement of 'diagnosis' suspicion when asthma is pre-diagnosed. Some plausible inferences (allergic component from pollen) but unverifiable additions lower score.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by structuring response around exacerbation symptoms, triggers' role, specific pollen-allergy link, family history contribution, and summary tying to doctor's allergy suspicion; no off-topic content."
