  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies the loss of taste as 'complete.' While the patient initially says they 'lost' their sense of taste in [P-1], they clarify in [P-4] that they can still taste 'really, really salty foods,' making it a partial loss. The gold answer correctly identifies both smell and taste as partial losses.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details requested by the prompt, specifically the patient's descriptions of what they could and could not perceive (e.g., being able to smell 'really bad' odors, being able to taste salty foods but not bananas). It also omits the duration (two days) and the consistency of the symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that there was a 'complete loss' of taste is contradicted by statement [P-4] in the transcript. The model relied solely on the initial statement in [P-1] and ignored the clarification provided later in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and directly addresses the question asked, though it provides a superficial summary that lacks the specific details requested in the second half of the prompt."
