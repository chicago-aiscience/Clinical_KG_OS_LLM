  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the primary shift toward COVID-19 and the secondary consideration of influenza. However, it incorrectly suggests the patient is 'likely spreading them to her husband' in point 4, whereas the transcript [P-1, P-19] indicates the husband was ill for a week before the patient's symptoms began (household transmission from husband to patient).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses a specific component of the prompt regarding 'limited outside contact.' The Gold Answer details how working from home and the hiking trip limit exposure to household transmission, while the Generated Answer focuses only on the husband's illness and the flu shot, neglecting the supporting details of their isolated lifestyle.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally grounded in the transcript but includes meta-commentary references like 'Knowledge Graph' and 'KG' which are not part of the provided source. Additionally, as noted in correctness, it misinterprets the direction of transmission between the husband and patient.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the core of the question, explaining how the risk factors (husband's illness, lack of flu shot) impact the doctor's prioritization of COVID-19 over influenza."
