  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most statements match the transcript and Gold Answer: dry cough x2 weeks, chest soreness after coughing, negative COVID test, no current meds for cough, dietary avoidance for reflux (acidic foods/chocolate), and history of anxiety. However, the anxiety section is somewhat misleading: it says the transcript does not indicate current treatments/meds for anxiety, whereas the transcript does state the patient is not currently taking medications and previously took an anxiety medication 2–3 years ago and stopped. No direct contradictions beyond that omission/wording issue.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) not taking prescribed meds for the cough and requesting meds; (2) reflux managed with diet avoidance; (3) acknowledges anxiety.\nKey points missed: (1) explicit statement that the patient is currently on zero prescribed medications overall (not just for cough); (2) prior anxiety medication stopped 2–3 years ago; (3) hay fever is present and no treatment described; (4) clinician plan (exam/consult before next steps) and that no cough medication was prescribed/recommended in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all claims are directly supported by quoted transcript segments. The phrase “provided knowledge graph” is not in the transcript (minor ungrounded framing). Also, the anxiety-treatment statement is not fully faithful to the transcript’s clear “used to, not anymore,” though it does not invent a medication or therapy.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on medication/treatment status across conditions and specifically addresses acid reflux management and whether prescribed medications are being taken. No meaningful tangents."
