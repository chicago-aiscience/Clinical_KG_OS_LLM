  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the main timeline points from the Gold Answer: 3-month onset [P-2], 1-month sleep disruption [P-19, P-21], 3-day productive greenish sputum [P-2, P-9, P-12, D-47], and couple-days subjective fevers [P-4]. Minor discrepancies include omitting the specific pole dancing onset [P-13], initial dry/intermittent nature explicitly [P-2], precise 'every night' sleep disruption [P-21], and fatigue cause [P-19]; also lacks the acute-on-chronic summary phrasing, but core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: 3mo onset, 1mo sleep disruption, 3d productive green sputum, couple d fevers, D-47 summary. Missed/less detailed: pole dancing onset [P-13], dry intermittent for first 2mo [P-2], 'pretty well every night' [P-21], fatigue [P-19], full acute-on-chronic pattern description. Covers ~85% of details, including all question-specified timings.",
    "faithfulness": "All timeline claims verifiable: 3mo [P-2], sleep 1mo [P-19, P-21 implied, D-20-21], 3d green gunk [P-2, P-9, P-12, D-47], fevers [P-4]. Citations accurate. Minor issue: references non-existent 'knowledge graph' and 'respiratory infection indicated by... knowledge graph', which is unverifiable/hallucinated as no KG in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures timeline directly addressing question's required elements (onset, sleep disruption timing, productive sputum timing, fevers timing) with no off-topic content beyond minor closing phrase."
