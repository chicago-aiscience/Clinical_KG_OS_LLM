  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly reflects that the mother suspected a school-related source (possible COVID) and that symptoms began after returning from school Wednesday [P-1, P-2]. It correctly reports that there were no known sick contacts outside of school [P-38], that at-school contacts were uncertain (“hard to say”) [P-38], and that the school had not contacted them about exposures [P-39]. Minor issue: it frames the motivation for testing partly using the doctor’s wording/counseling [D-44] rather than the mother’s stated school-return requirement [P-41].",
    "completeness": "Covers most key Gold Answer points: (1) school as suspected source, (2) onset after school, (3) no known sick contacts outside school, (4) uncertainty about in-school exposures, and (5) no school notification. It misses an important Gold Answer detail: the mother said the school requires a COVID test to return and to enable notification of other families about exposure [P-41]. It also omits the Gold Answer’s additional narrowing context (no travel/environmental exposures), though that is less central to the user’s question.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate citations [P-1, P-2, P-38, P-39]. Minor faithfulness concern: it introduces “knowledge graph,” which is not in the transcript, and leans on [D-44] to characterize the mother’s intent for testing, whereas the mother’s explicit school policy reason is [P-41]. These are minor rather than major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how school attendance factored into suspected source and what the mother reported about sick contacts at school vs outside, including lack of school notification. No substantial irrelevant content."
