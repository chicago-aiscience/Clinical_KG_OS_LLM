  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer and transcript regarding medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), supplements (multivitamin), and their lack of effectiveness.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the core medications and supplements. However, it misses several contextual points included in the Gold Answer: the explicit confirmation that no other medications are taken, the mention of stress management techniques (reading and running), and the patient's smoking status. While these are not strictly 'medications', the Gold Answer includes them as part of the patient's routine/management.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript with correct citations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and stays strictly focused on the specific question about 'medications and supplements', avoiding the lifestyle tangents included in the Gold Answer."
