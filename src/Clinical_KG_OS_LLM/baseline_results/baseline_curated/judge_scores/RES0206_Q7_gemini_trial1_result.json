  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the gold answer and source transcript. It correctly identifies the patient's baseline, the symptoms that evolved (cough, sputum, blood, fever, dyspnea), and the fact that the condition worsened.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer. Specifically, it omits the patient's functional baseline (walking the dog), the patient's explicit statement that this is the 'worst' episode she has experienced, and the comparative history of visiting the emergency room twice in three years without being hospitalized. These omissions weaken the 'severity comparison' part of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript, using correct speaker tags and attributing symptoms accurately to the patient's reports.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured to directly answer the three components of the user's question."
