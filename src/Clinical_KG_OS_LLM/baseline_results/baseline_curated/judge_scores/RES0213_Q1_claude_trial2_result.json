  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the main facts accurately. It correctly identifies the pain as sharp/strong occurring with deep breaths [P-3], lasting ~20 minutes [P-6], occurring when walking alone or studying [P-29], and resolving when engaged with others or hands-on tasks [P-9, P-29]. However, it adds an interpretive element not explicitly in the Gold Answer - attributing the pain to 'feelings of nervousness' and linking breathing difficulty to nervousness [P-19], which the Gold Answer does not characterize as a quality of the pain itself. The Gold Answer more neutrally presents the facts without this interpretation.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: sharp/strong pain quality, deep breath trigger, 20-minute duration, occurrence when alone (walking/studying), resolution when engaged with others/activities, and occurrence at rest. However, it misses several details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the initial description as 'uncomfortable' and 'odd' before clarifying as sharp pain [P-2], (2) intermittent nature 'here and there' rather than constant [P-6, P-7], (3) specific mention of sitting and studying [P-4], (4) no worsening with exercise [P-10], (5) no preceding injury [P-5], and (6) no prior occurrence [P-17]. These omissions reduce completeness score.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, there is a significant interpretive overreach in stating the pain is 'attributed to feelings of nervousness' and describing it as occurring 'specifically' when taking a deep breath due to nervousness [P-19]. The transcript shows the patient gets nervous about the pain (which then causes faster breathing), but doesn't establish that nervousness causes the pain itself. The sharp pain with deep breaths [P-3] is described separately from the anxiety response [P-19]. This represents a subtle but important mischaracterization of the temporal/causal relationship in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all aspects of the question: quality (sharp/strong with deep breaths), duration (20 minutes), situations of occurrence (walking alone, studying), and situations of resolution (engaged with others, hands-on tasks). The structure mirrors the question's components well. The inclusion of stress/anxiety context, while interpretive, relates to the 'situations' aspect of the question. No off-topic content is present."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a well-structured response that accurately captures the main characteristics of the chest pain with appropriate citations. It correctly identifies the sharp quality, 20-minute duration, and situational triggers/resolvers. However, it loses points for: (1) adding interpretive elements about nervousness causing the pain that overreach what the transcript establishes, (2) missing several details present in the Gold Answer including the initial 'uncomfortable/odd' description, intermittent nature, specific activities, exercise response, and no prior occurrence. The response remains highly relevant and largely faithful to the source material."
