  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer's medical reasoning. It correctly identifies the symptoms present (dry cough, fever, scratchy throat, headache) and those absent (sputum, GI issues, joint pain) and relates them to the URI diagnosis as described in the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses one significant detail present in the gold answer: the epidemiological link regarding the brother's recent cold, which supports a viral exposure. It also excludes the specific mention of malaise and fatigue as supporting factors.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript, but it references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the prompt or source text. This is a hallucination regarding the provided source material, though the clinical logic remains sound based on the transcript itself.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question by breaking down how both the presence and absence of specific symptoms support the doctor's assessment."
