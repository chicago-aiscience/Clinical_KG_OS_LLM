  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition both patient (citing P-1) and doctor (citing D-39) wanted to rule out, matching Gold's emphasis on P-1, D-2, and D-39. It correctly states the COVID swab test (D-39), 48-hour turnaround (D-39), and isolation instructions (D-39), with no factual errors or contradictions compared to Gold, though it omits minor details like 'today' for the test and public health follow-up.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: COVID-19 identified by both patient (P-1) and doctor (D-39/D-2), COVID swab test (D-39), 48 hours turnaround (D-39), stay isolated/not see anyone (D-39). Missed: explicit 'today' for test performance, 'further instructions from public health' (D-39), and minor contextual elaboration on pandemic/symptom overlap. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-1, D-39); no hallucinations, fabrications, or unverifiable details—e.g., COVID concern from patient, doctor's swab order, timeline, and isolation instructions all match D-39 and P-1 exactly.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses all four question elements (condition, test, turnaround time, instructions) in a structured bullet-point format with no off-topic content or tangents."
