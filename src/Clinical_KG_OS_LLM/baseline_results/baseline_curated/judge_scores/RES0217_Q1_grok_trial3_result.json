  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the local symptoms of redness, tenderness, and soreness at the tick bite site behind the left knee, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [P-1, P-6]. However, it has significant factual errors in the systemic symptoms section: it incorrectly interprets P-1's clarification ('not the joint itself') as a denial of systemic joint pain instead of referencing the explicit screening denial at D-7/P-7; misattributes the headaches denial to P-6 (which is about rash, not headaches) instead of D-19/P-19; and falsely claims no explicit fever denial despite P-8 ('No, no, I've been fine') responding to D-8. These contradictions to the Gold Answer's accurate citations and facts warrant a score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness, location behind left knee) - yes; denial of bullseye rash - no; 'stuck pretty good' - no; 'totally fine' aside from tenderness/'pretty healthy' - partially implied but not stated; systemic screenings and denials for joint pain, fever, headaches - listed but with incomplete/erroneous support. Covers core symptoms (about 60-70% of details), missing some local specifics like rash denial and additional qualifiers, so 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Local symptoms claims verifiable in transcript [P-1, P-6]. Systemic: joint pain partial ground in P-1 but misapplied to systemic; headaches citation [P-6] incorrect (P-6 denies rash, headaches denial in P-19); fever screening [D-8] verifiable but denial [P-8] explicitly contradicted by claim of 'no explicit denial'. Multiple inaccurate citations and interpretations indicate hallucinated associations, score 2.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around local symptoms at the tick bite site and systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, headaches) screened and denied, perfectly matching the question with no off-topic content, score 5."
