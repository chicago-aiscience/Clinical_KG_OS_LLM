  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the grandson exposure from [P-23] and links it to the doctor's assessment of infection in [D-36], but introduces a hallucinated 'Knowledge Graph' reference not present anywhere. Critically, it incorrectly states that the transcript 'does not contain evidence' for exploration of travel or client visits, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence ([D-24,P-24] for travel; [D-32,P-32] and [P-31] for clients), which were explicitly explored and excluded. This represents significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: grandson visit, cold, daycare [P-23] (partial, misses family not knowing illness and symptom onset timing [P-1]); doctor acknowledgment [D-24] (implied but not explicit); infection assessment [D-36]. Missed entirely: precise timing linkage, travel exclusion [D-24,P-24], occupational exposure details and exclusion [P-31,D-32,P-32], conclusion that these make grandson the likely source. Covers roughly 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about grandson [P-23] and infection [D-36] are verifiable in transcript. However, 'Knowledge Graph' is fully hallucinated/not in transcript. Assertion that transcript lacks evidence for travel/client exploration is false—directly contradicted by [D-24,P-24,D-32,P-32,P-31]. Symptoms correlation is plausible but overstates 'diagnosis confirmation' and COVID link beyond transcript. Multiple inaccuracies and hallucinations present.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses grandson connection to infection assessment and mentions other pathways (travel, clients), though incorrectly denying their exploration; no major off-topic content, focused on question elements."
