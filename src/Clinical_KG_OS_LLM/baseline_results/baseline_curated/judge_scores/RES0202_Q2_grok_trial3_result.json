  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation due to COVID-compatible symptoms, and specific isolation from the younger sister, all precisely matching the facts in the Gold Answer and transcript [D-44]. There are no factual errors, discrepancies, or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered from Gold Answer: COVID swab test and results timeframe [D-44], isolation for 14 days [D-44], isolation specifically from younger sister [D-44]. Key points missed: full household composition including parents and sister [P-35], ER precautions for high temperature, neurological symptoms (seizures), weakness, dizziness, or fainting [D-44], possibility of false-negative results and alternative viral illness [D-44], no medications/supportive observational approach [D-44], mother's acknowledgment of limited intervention for viruses [P-41], school requirement for test results [P-41]. Covers the question-specified elements (test, isolation details, who to isolate from) but misses other important management measures, estimating 50-79% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims (COVID swab/24-48 hours, 14-day isolation, separation from younger sister) are directly verifiable in transcript [D-44] with accurate citations; no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer uses bullet points to directly and concisely address the exact elements of the question—diagnostic tests, isolation instructions/duration, and specific household member (younger sister) to isolate from—with no off-topic or extraneous content."
