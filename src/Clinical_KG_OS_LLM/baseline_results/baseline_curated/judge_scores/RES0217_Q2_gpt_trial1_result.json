  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the patient is on an unspecified statin for cholesterol management and that the clinician discussed starting prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72 hours of tick attachment. It also correctly notes no antibiotic name/dose/duration was given (implicitly by not specifying any). Minor issues: it frames prophylactic antibiotics as a treatment “for Lyme disease” (the visit discussed prevention/risk reduction rather than a confirmed diagnosis), and it introduces “knowledge graph” assertions not present in the transcript, though they do not materially change the main clinical facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: (1) current statin use with unknown name; (2) proposal to start prophylactic antibiotics for the tick bite based on time attached and Lyme prevention. Key points missed: (1) denial of allergies/no drug allergies; (2) prior tick bite history with bullseye rash treated with antibiotics; (3) plan to consult supervising physician before finalizing; (4) discussion of sending the tick for species identification and possible bloodwork/serology; (5) environmental prevention suggestion (insecticide/yard measures).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript (statin use; prophylactic antibiotics discussion; rationale of possible >72 hours). However, references to a “knowledge graph” and its claimed relationships are not in the transcript, and framing prophylaxis as being taken for a Lyme disease ‘diagnosis’ is not strictly grounded. Overall, the answer is largely transcript-faithful with minor non-transcript embellishment.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments discussed (statin and prophylactic antibiotics). It does not substantially drift off-topic, though it omits other relevant treatments (tick testing/bloodwork/insecticide)."
