  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis age and the general increase in symptoms. However, it misattributes the 'near-daily use' descriptor to nighttime symptoms specifically (which occur every other day), whereas the transcript and prompt use 'near-daily' to describe the overall 5-6 times per week usage. Most other facts align with the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key quantitative and clinical details present in the gold answer: the specific baseline frequency (once every two weeks), the specific current frequency (5-6 times per week), the patient's current age (10), the symptom of chest tightness, the detail that wheezing episodes exceed bronchodilator use, and the clarification of the two-week duration. It covers less than 50% of the key points compared to the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the provided transcript. It correctly cites the relevant sections [P-9, P-1, P-15, P-18, P-11]. It mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the prompt, but the actual content remains faithful to the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the evolution of asthma symptoms and bronchodilator usage as requested by the question, organizing the response chronologically."
