  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis and accurately states the test was negative. However, it contains a factual error stating the cough 'worsened into a dry cough' when the transcript shows the cough remained 'kind of the same' in intensity [P-7]. The core facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers key points including: COVID-19 investigation, hospital worker status, persistent cough, resolution of other flu-like symptoms, coworker concern, and negative test result. However, it omits several details present in the Gold Answer: specific timeline of test (approximately two weeks ago at symptom onset [P-36]), the patient staying home since testing [P-36], PPE use and carefulness [P-17], specific flu symptoms mentioned (sore throat, runny nose), and the social/occupational pressure context. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The statement about the cough 'worsening' is an interpretation error rather than fabrication, as the transcript does discuss cough progression from productive to dry [P-5, P-6]. No hallucinated content, but one minor mischaracterization of cough intensity progression.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated (COVID-19), what evidence prompted investigation (hospital worker status, persistent cough, coworker concern), and what testing revealed (negative result). All content is relevant and focused on answering the specific question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis and provides accurate core information with proper citations. It addresses all components of the question relevantly. However, it lacks several contextual details present in the Gold Answer (timing, PPE use, staying home, specific symptoms) and contains one minor factual mischaracterization about cough intensity worsening. The answer is substantially correct but could be more comprehensive."
