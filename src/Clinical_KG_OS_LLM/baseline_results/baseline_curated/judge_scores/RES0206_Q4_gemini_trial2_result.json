  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is fully consistent with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19), the test (COVID swab), and the specific social contact details (walking dogs with a sick friend and walking too close).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the three primary components of the question. However, it omits some supplementary details found in the gold answer, such as the doctor's inquiry regarding the friend's test status and the systematic screening for other COVID-19 symptoms (taste/smell/travel). While it captures the main 'prompt', it is slightly less comprehensive than the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript with accurate citations for the doctor's statements and patient's history.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and concise. It addresses each part of the multi-part question directly without including unnecessary information."
