  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the duration (three days), the nature of the symptom (tightness, not pain), and the primary trigger (walking/breathing in). It accurately notes the patient's history of asthma and the difference in sensation. No false information was provided.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points explicitly requested in the prompt and present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to state whether the symptoms are getting better, worse, or staying the same (the patient stated they were 'staying the same'). It omits 'getting up out of a chair' as a specific exacerbating activity. It also fails to provide the specific detail of the functional impact on the walking routine (reducing from two walks to one daily) and the lack of impact on work.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It uses direct quotes and citations correctly. It does not hallucinate information, though it includes details about hoarseness and phlegm which, while in the transcript, are tangential to the specific development of the chest tightness.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but ignores specific components of the multi-part prompt, such as the better/worse/same status and the specific quantitative impact on the walking routine. It includes some tangential information about hoarseness and phlegm that wasn't strictly asked for regarding the 'chest tightness' development itself."
