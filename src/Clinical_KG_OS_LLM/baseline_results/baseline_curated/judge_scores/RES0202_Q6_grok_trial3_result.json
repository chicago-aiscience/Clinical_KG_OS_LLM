  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. All mentioned elements (COVID swab with 24-48 hour TAT, assessment as infection with fever ruling out asthma, 14-day isolation due to COVID-like symptoms, false negatives, alternative viral illness, specific warning signs) match exactly, including citations. No contradictions or errors; interpretive words like 'strict' isolation are minor and do not alter facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab and TAT (100%), isolation period (partial, misses 'including from younger sister if possible'), false negatives (100%), alternative diagnosis if negative (100%), warning signs with examples (100%), assessment as COVID-aligned infection (covered via 'symptoms consistent with COVID-19' and 'infection'), asthma consideration (100%). Missed: explicit 'no medications; watchful waiting with return precautions' and precise isolation phrasing for sister. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [D-44] for test, isolation, false neg, alt dx, warnings; [D-45] for infection and asthma). No fabricated facts from transcript. Minor unverifiable detail: mentions 'knowledge graph' not present in source materials.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around diagnostic test/TAT, assessment, isolation, alternatives/false neg, and specific warning signs with bullet list; no off-topic content or tangents."
