  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient's current statin therapy for cholesterol management, matching Gold Answer's description [P-14, P-15]. It accurately describes the proposed prophylactic antibiotics for Lyme disease prevention, including the rationale of potential >72-hour attachment [D-6] and the 'safer than not' reasoning [D-18], consistent with Gold. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer; references to knowledge graph align with plausible facts but do not contradict.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Current medications - cholesterol management and unnamed statin [P-14, P-15] (covered); no allergies [P-16, P-17] (missed); (2) Past treatment - prior tick bite with bullseye rash and antibiotics [P-3] (missed); (3) New prophylactic antibiotics - recommendation due to >72h [D-6], 'safer' [D-18], 'moving forward' [D-13], no specifics, consult physician [D-13, D-22] (partially covered: main rec and some rationale, misses D-13/consult/no specifics); (4) Environmental prevention - insecticide [D-18] (missed). Covers approximately 50-60% of key points (core statin and prophylactic abx), misses allergies, past history, full details on prophylaxis, and prevention.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript claims are verifiable: statin for cholesterol [P-14, P-15], prophylactic abx discussion [D-6, D-18], 72h risk from outdoor activities [D-6]. Citations accurate. However, repeated references to a 'knowledge graph' (confirms statin for cholesterol, supports abx for Lyme) are not present in the transcript, introducing unverifiable details that are plausible but constitute minor hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by listing current statin therapy and proposed prophylactic antibiotics for the tick bite, with relevant citations and a focused summary; no off-topic content."
