  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the symptoms it lists (cough, breathing difficulty, wheezing) and the frequency differences between day and night. It correctly identifies the cough as dry and the specific frequencies mentioned in the transcript. However, it fails to mention 'chest sensations' (chest tightness), which was explicitly requested in the prompt and confirmed in the transcript [P-20].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most of the key points from the Gold Answer and transcript: the dry cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing, along with the day/night frequency comparison. It misses one specific category requested by the prompt: 'chest sensations' (chest tightness).",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript and includes accurate speaker tags/citations. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question. However, by omitting the 'chest sensations' portion of the multi-part question, it is slightly less than perfectly focused on the full scope of the inquiry."
