{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the two-week duration, the initial flu-like symptoms, the 4-5 day duration of mucus production, the 'whitish clear' appearance of the mucus, and the transition to a dry cough.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several points from the gold answer. Notably, it fails to address the prompt's specific requirement to describe how the cough's intensity and frequency changed over time (which the transcript identifies as stable/unchanged). It also omits details regarding the absence of fever, the specific symptoms of sore throat and runny nose, and the negative COVID test result mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely faithful to the transcript. All claims regarding the timeline, mucus description, and chest soreness are supported by specific patient statements (e.g., [P-2], [P-5], [P-6], [P-14], [P-15]).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to address the specific components of the question. However, it is slightly less relevant for the specific part of the prompt asking about intensity and frequency changes, as it glosses over these details."
