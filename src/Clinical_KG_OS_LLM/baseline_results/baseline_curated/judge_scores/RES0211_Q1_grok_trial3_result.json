  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies dry cough, scratchy throat, and headache as reported symptoms with accurate citations from the transcript (matching Gold). However, it inaccurately attributes 'fever' solely to the doctor's summary [D-58] without noting the patient's report of feeling 'really hot' [P-7, P-9]; adds post-nasal drip [P-18] as a primary symptom, which Gold attributes to allergies rather than the 3-4 day history; misses key reported symptoms like malaise ('crappy/icky'), persistent hot flashes day/night, and tiredness. For denials, it wrongly claims no explicit denial of sputum (contradicts [P-5, P-6]) and asserts 'no information' on nausea, joint pain, rashes (contradicts explicit denials in [P-10, P-11, P-13]), introducing significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key reported symptoms: dry cough/scratchy throat, headache, feeling hot day/night, malaise/crappy/icky, tiredness (5 points). Generated covers dry cough, scratchy throat, headache (3/5). Gold denied: sputum/phlegm, rashes/skin changes, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, joint aches (5 points, plus breathing). Generated covers 0/5 correctly, misstates all. Total coverage ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims for dry cough, scratchy throat, headache verifiable [P-1, P-2, P-4]; 'fever' loosely grounded in [P-7, P-9, D-58]; post-nasal drip verifiable [P-18] but contextually about allergies. However, hallucinated absence of explicit sputum denial (verifiable [P-5, P-6, D-5]); falsely claims 'transcript does not contain information' on nausea [P-11/D-11], rashes [P-10/D-10], joint pain [P-13/D-13]—multiple hallucinated facts about content absence.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists reported symptoms and addresses denied symptoms (including examples), structured to match question's two parts; minor tangent in implying sputum absence without explicit denial and adding post-nasal drip, but overall focused."
