  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (worsening cough from P-1, sputum changes from P-6, increased dyspnea from P-1) and links them to the patient's COPD history and the doctor's assessment in D-52, matching the Gold Answer's core facts without contradictions or errors, though it provides less detail on symptom triggers (e.g., exertion in P-5/P-8) and COPD duration/inhalers.",
    "completeness": "Covers all three key symptoms (worsening cough, sputum changes, increased dyspnea) and the doctor's synthesis in D-52 with COPD history; misses finer details like cough triggered by stairs (P-5), specific SOB progression on walks (P-8), 5-year COPD diagnosis (P-2), and inhalers (P-11), achieving about 80-90% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-1, P-6, D-52); no hallucinations, though introductory mention of 'knowledge graph' is extraneous but not a factual claim.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response around the exact symptom combination and doctor's linking logic as queried, with no off-topic content."
