  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor's concluding remarks and the stated plan are not included in the text, claiming the transcript ends at [P-29]. In reality, the transcript extends to [D-33], which contains the specific plan ('I'll pass it on to the doctor who'll take a look at you'). While the clinical information summarized in the second half is factually accurate regarding the patient's symptoms, the foundational error regarding the text's content is a significant factual failure.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the first half of the question (the stated plan). Regarding the clinical information, it misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including: failed OTC treatments (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), pertinent negatives (no trauma, no fevers, no asthma), and specific psychosocial details (living alone, multivitamin use).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination regarding the provided source material, claiming the transcript is truncated when it is not. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the context. However, the clinical details it does mention are grounded in the text up to [P-29].",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. It fails to address the specific request for the 'stated plan' due to its error about the transcript length. It focuses well on the clinical information but misses the primary instruction to use the concluding remarks."
