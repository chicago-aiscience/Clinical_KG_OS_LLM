  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and their general timing (cough ~4–5 days; runny nose past couple of days). However, it contains major factual inaccuracies by stating that the transcript does not specify whether the cough is productive/non-productive and does not describe nasal discharge appearance. In the transcript, the cough is explicitly described as dry and non-productive (no “gunk”/sputum), and the nasal discharge is described as “pretty clear.” These errors conflict with the Gold Answer and source transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) cough present ~4–5 days; (2) runny nose present past couple of days. Key points missed: cough characterized as dry; explicitly non-productive; cough unchanged (stayed the same); nasal discharge described as clear; historical note that he’s never had a dry cough like this and prior runny noses didn’t last as long; pertinent negatives (no sore throat, chest pain; no wheeze/SOB per mom). Overall, it captures less than half of the required details.",
    "faithfulness": "While it does not invent new symptoms, it incorrectly claims the transcript lacks information that is plainly present (dry/non-productive cough; clear nasal discharge). This is a form of unfaithfulness to the source because it misrepresents available evidence, despite otherwise grounded quoting of cough duration.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question (respiratory symptoms and their characteristics) and does not add irrelevant material. However, it fails to provide the specific requested characteristics (productive vs non-productive; discharge appearance), which reduces how well it addresses the question."
