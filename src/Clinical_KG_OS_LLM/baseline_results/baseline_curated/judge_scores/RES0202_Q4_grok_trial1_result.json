  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition and fever as the excluding clinical finding, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. It accurately paraphrases the doctor's statement about adding asthma if there was no fever. However, it has minor discrepancies: incorrect citation of [D-44] instead of [D-45], references a non-existent 'knowledge graph,' and states 'fever rules out the asthma medical history' which overstates exclusion (Gold notes it's not permanently ruled out). Core facts are correct, so score 4.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: condition (asthma), hypothetical presentation (cough/SOB without fever), excluding finding (fever with citations to [P-1],[P-2]). Misses Gold's details like exact [D-45] quote, no wheezing [P-7], uncertain SOB [P-8], and nuance that asthma is not permanently ruled out but deprioritized for infection workup. Covers ~80-90% of key points, score 4.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded in transcript: doctor's statement [though wrong citation [D-44] vs actual [D-45]], fever reports [P-1,P-2]. However, hallucinates 'knowledge graph provided' and 'fever rules out asthma medical history' (transcript doesn't mention KG or 'medical history' for asthma; child has no history). Citation error and fabrication make it partially ungrounded, score 3.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses the question by naming asthma and fever as the key elements with transcript support. Minor irrelevant mention of knowledge graph, but overall perfectly focused, score 5."
