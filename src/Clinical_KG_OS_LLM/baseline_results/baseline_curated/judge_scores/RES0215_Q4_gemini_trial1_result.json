  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by claiming the doctor did not ask about fever, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, rashes, or phlegm. These questions are explicitly present in the transcript at turns D-7, D-8, D-10, [D-11, D-13, and D-31 respectively. Consequently, it fails to explain the medical reasoning behind these questions provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points regarding the screening logic (e.g., screening for pneumonia, bronchitis, URI, or systemic conditions). It provides a general assessment of asthma but ignores the specific differential diagnosis narrowing requested by the prompt's specific question set.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a significant failure in faithfulness by hallucinating that information is missing from the source transcript when it is clearly present. This is a direct contradiction of the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant because it denies the premise of the question based on a false reading of the transcript. While it discusses the patient's condition (asthma/bronchitis), it fails to address the specific inquiry about the doctor's screening questions."
