  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly accurate but contains a minor factual discrepancy. It states the doctor noted the patient 'takes' a rescue puffer, whereas the transcript (P-17, P-18, D-34, D-35) clarifies that the patient has not refilled the rescue inhaler in years and is currently limiting medication. The doctor's reasoning was based on the fact that the patient *wasn't* using it effectively, rather than the fact that they were.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific mention of the patient limiting/skipping asthma medication (evening maintenance dose and rescue inhaler), which the doctor explicitly summarized as part of his reasoning in D-34. 2) The exclusion of new environmental triggers (P-33). 3) The patient's own admission that the symptoms might be asthma-related despite feeling different (P-16). It covers approximately 60% of the logic points provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It uses specific citations for symptoms and the absence of cardiac pain. The interpretation of the doctor's logic is faithful to the dialogue provided.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the combination of symptoms/history and the logic used to link them. It remains focused on the diagnostic process without irrelevant information."
