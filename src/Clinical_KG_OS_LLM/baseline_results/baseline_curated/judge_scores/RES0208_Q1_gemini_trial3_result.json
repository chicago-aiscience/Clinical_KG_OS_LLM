  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer has some factual and categorization discrepancies compared to the Gold Answer. It categorizes 'Headaches' as 'Sensory Changes', whereas the Gold Answer correctly identifies the sensory changes as loss of taste and smell. Additionally, it attributes a 'dry throat sensation' to P-8, but the transcript actually refers to a dry cough. It misses the most significant clinical findings mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the subjective fever and sensory losses.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly incomplete. It misses 100% of the actual sensory changes mentioned (taste and smell), the constitutional finding of subjective fever/warmth, and the specific reporting of a sore throat. It covers only approximately 45% of the specific symptoms detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript in that it does not invent symptoms. However, it slightly misinterprets P-8 (describing a 'dry throat' instead of a dry cough) and miscategorizes headaches, but no outright hallucinations of non-existent facts were found.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, organizing the information according to the specific categories requested in the prompt."
