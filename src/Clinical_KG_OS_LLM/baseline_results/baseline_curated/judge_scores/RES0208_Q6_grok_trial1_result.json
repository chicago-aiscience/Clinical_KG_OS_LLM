  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate to the Gold Answer and transcript for all core management plan elements (physical exam, diagnostics, self-isolation, timeline, criteria), with minor additions like clinical impression from [D-36] that are correct but not emphasized in Gold; however, 'knowledge graph' is an unsubstantiated reference not in transcript or Gold, creating a minor discrepancy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: physical exam (chest focus and proceeding), diagnostics (CXR and COVID swab), self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone incl. wife, self-isolate), timeline (24-48h), criteria (based on results); missed: public health nurse contact if positive, explicit note on no numerical thresholds, and encounter proceeding to exam explicitly.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about management plan verifiable in [D-37-38] with accurate citations; clinical impression grounded in [D-36]; sole hallucination is reference to 'knowledge graph' not present in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around exact components of management plan (exam, tests, isolation, timeline, criteria), with relevant contextual impression; no off-topic content."
