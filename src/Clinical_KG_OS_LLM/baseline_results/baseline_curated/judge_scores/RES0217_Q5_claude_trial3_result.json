  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient's outdoor activities on Friday and Saturday and accurately quotes the doctor's 72-hour attachment calculation [D-6]. However, it makes a critical factual error by claiming that Strathroy's position on the Lyme disease distribution map is 'not present' in the transcript. The Gold Answer clearly documents that the doctor referenced the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map at [P-12] and [D-13], stating 'Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.' This is a significant factual error contradicting information explicitly present in both the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the required content. It adequately addresses the attachment duration calculation based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening. However, it completely fails to address the second major component of the question regarding the doctor's use of Strathroy's geographic position on the Lyme disease distribution map. The Gold Answer provides specific citations [P-12, D-13] showing the doctor's geographic risk assessment, which the Generated Answer incorrectly claims is absent from the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination by asserting that information about Strathroy's position on the Lyme disease distribution map is 'not present' in the transcript. This directly contradicts verifiable statements in the source material at [P-12] where the patient states 'We were uh in Strathroy along the creek' and [D-13] where the doctor explicitly references the Lyme disease distribution map and Strathroy's position on it. The claim of absence is fabricated and contradicts the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses only half of the two-part question. It provides relevant information about the attachment duration calculation but then explicitly denies the existence of information that directly answers the second part of the question about geographic mapping. The denial itself is relevant to the question but provides incorrect information, making the response only partially useful."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly addresses the tick attachment duration calculation (72+ hours based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening) but contains a critical factual error. It incorrectly claims that information about Strathroy's position on the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map is absent from the transcript, when this information is explicitly present at [P-12] and [D-13]. This represents both a completeness failure (missing 50% of required content) and a faithfulness issue (hallucinating the absence of verifiable information). The answer covers only half the question adequately while providing demonstrably false information about the other half."
