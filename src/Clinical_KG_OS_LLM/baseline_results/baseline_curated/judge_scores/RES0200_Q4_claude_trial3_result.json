  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, COVID swab as the specific test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three required components: (1) alternative diagnosis (COVID), (2) specific test (COVID swab), and (3) turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, it lacks the additional context provided in the Gold Answer about which symptoms specifically overlapped (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) and the patient's presentation details. This additional context enriches understanding but the core answer is complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The citations are accurate and specific. No hallucinated information is present. The answer is fully grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis to exclude, what test was ordered, and the expected turnaround time. The response is focused and concise with no irrelevant information."
