  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53], matching the Gold Answer. For rationale, it accurately quotes the doctor's explicit prioritization due to the husband's symptoms [D-53, P-19], aligning with Gold's core epidemiological focus. However, it introduces symptoms (fever, sore throat from [P-1]) as a primary reason for prioritization, whereas Gold emphasizes household transmission over symptom overlap with flu; minor discrepancy in emphasis but no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: test (swab [D-53]), household transmission (husband [P-19]), explicit quote [D-53], prioritization over influenza. Missed: self-isolation instruction as reinforcing urgency [D-53], influenza mentioned secondarily after no flu shot [P-53, D-54]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: swab [D-53], symptoms [P-1], husband [P-19], quote [D-53], infectious rule-out [D-53]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses both question parts (test ordered, rationale prioritizing COVID over influenza) with focused structure, no off-topic content."
