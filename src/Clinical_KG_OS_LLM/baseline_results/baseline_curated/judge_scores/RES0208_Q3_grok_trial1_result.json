  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies 'fevers and fatigue and muscle aches' as evidence of general infectious process in D-36, and 'difficulty breathing' plus 'sore throat and cough' as additional symptoms preventing ruling out COVID-19. Generated Answer incorrectly includes 'difficulty breathing', 'sore throat', and 'cough' in the general infection evidence alongside fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches, misaligning with Gold's separation. For COVID-19, Generated attributes 'loss of taste' and 'loss of smell' (not cited by doctor in D-36 per Gold), relying on a non-existent 'knowledge graph' instead of transcript, introducing significant factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: general infection - fevers, fatigue, muscle aches; additional for COVID - difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough; taste/smell elicited but not cited in assessment; respiratory focus. Generated covers fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (but wrongly grouped), mentions dyspnea/sore throat/cough (wrong category), ignores taste/smell not being cited by doctor, misses respiratory focus explanation; covers ~20-49% accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated quotes D-36 partially but misinterprets grouping; introduces 'knowledge graph' (absent from transcript) to justify symptoms and COVID markers like loss of taste/smell, which doctor elicited (P-4,P-6) but did not cite in D-36 assessment; multiple hallucinations via external unverifiable source and incorrect symptom attribution.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response around general infection evidence and additional COVID symptoms, directly mirroring question's two parts, though with errors; minor tangent via 'knowledge graph' but overall focused."
