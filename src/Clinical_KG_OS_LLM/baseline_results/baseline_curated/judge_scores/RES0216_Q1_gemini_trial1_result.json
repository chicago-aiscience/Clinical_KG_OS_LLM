  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error. It claims that symptoms like fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, sweating, and cough were not mentioned in the transcript. However, the transcript shows the doctor specifically asked about these in turns D-6 and D-11 through D-15, and the patient explicitly denied them in turns P-6 and P-11 through P-15. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these as denied symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is incomplete. It misses several reported symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as hoarseness, increased phlegm, and throat clearing (P-11). It also fails to list 7 out of the 8 specifically asked-for 'commonly screened symptoms' that were denied by the patient.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It explicitly states that certain symptoms 'were not mentioned in the transcript,' which is a hallucination of absence. These symptoms were a significant part of the clinical screening dialogue (D/P 6-15).",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to address both reported symptoms and denials, but the failure to accurately capture the content of the transcript makes the response largely unhelpful for the specific question asked."
