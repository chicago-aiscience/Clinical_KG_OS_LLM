  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three risk factors and cites relevant transcript segments (e.g., [P-37] for smoking, [P-33] for occupation, [P-42] for family history). However, it omits key details from Gold like smoking start at age 15 [P-38], specific mechanisms (mucociliary clearance impairment, pneumonia predisposition, COPD risks), hemoptysis [P-4,P-6], and occupational mitigators (safety measures, engineering side not direct plant work [P-34]). It overstates occupational risk without noting patient's reassurance and includes irrelevant cannabis mention [P-40]. Core relations to symptoms are accurate but less precise than Gold's focus on infection vs. malignancy vigilance. Minor discrepancies overall.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Smoking (pack/day [P-37], age 15 [P-38], impairs clearance/immune -> pneumonia/COPD/bronchitis/malignancy, re: cough/hemoptysis); Occupational (consultant Sarnia [P-33], safe/engineering side [P-34], mitigates pneumonitis but low-level possible); Family (grandpa smoker lung ca [P-42], genetic risk); Collective (infection likely but hemoptysis+history -> malignancy vigilance). Generated covers basics of each factor's details and general relations to cough/pain, but misses smoking age/onset specifics/mechanisms, full occupational details/mitigation, hemoptysis emphasis, and precise collective vigilance post-treatment. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited transcript references ([P-37],[P-40],[P-33],[P-18],[P-42],[P-1],[P-15],[P-17]) are accurate and verifiable. Symptom links (cough, pain, throat) grounded in transcript. Interpretations like smoking causing mucosal damage or occupational irritants are plausible inferences but not directly stated; occupational exacerbation slightly stretches patient's minimization [P-34]. No major fabrications, minor overreach on 'strong genetic predisposition' from single smoker grandfather. Mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the three specified risk factors, elicits details with citations, explains relations to respiratory presentation (cough, pain, etc.), and summarizes collective high-risk impact, perfectly matching question focus with no off-topic content."
