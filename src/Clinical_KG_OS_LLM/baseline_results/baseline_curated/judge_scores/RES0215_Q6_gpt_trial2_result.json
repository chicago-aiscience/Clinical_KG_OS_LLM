  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The stated immediate plan (physical exam → talk to the physician → return to discuss next steps) matches the Gold Answer and is consistent with [D-58]. The environmental factor mentioned (carpets/new carpets) is also accurate per [P-54]. However, by listing only carpets under “Environmental Factors Assessed,” the response is somewhat misleading because multiple additional environmental exposures were explicitly assessed in the transcript (smoke, pets, fireplaces, air filters, etc.). No direct false statements are made.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) physical exam, (2) consult with physician, (3) return to discuss next steps.\nMissed from Gold Answer: (1) doctor’s offer to take questions before proceeding; (2) explicit note that no tests/imaging/medications were named; (3) multiple assessed home environmental factors—household smoking, pets, wood-burning fireplace/stove, air filters; (4) home context (townhouse; who lives at home). Overall, it includes the core plan but only ~1 of several environmental factors.",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are supported by the transcript (plan in [D-58]; carpets in [P-54]). No invented exams/tests/medications or environmental exposures are added. The main issue is omission rather than fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question (immediate next steps and environmental assessment), though the environmental portion is significantly underdeveloped."
