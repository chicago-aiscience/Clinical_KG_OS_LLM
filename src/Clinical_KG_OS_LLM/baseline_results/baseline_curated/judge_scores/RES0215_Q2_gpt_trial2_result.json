{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the only medication used is occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies (supported by [P-35], [P-36]) and correctly notes that there are no prescribed medications in her management ([P-36]). It does not introduce incorrect medications or treatments.",
    "completeness": "It captures the key points about Reactine/OTC antihistamines and explicitly no prescribed medications. However, it omits several Gold Answer elements asked by the question: (1) that nothing is given for the current wheezing/SOB episodes and they resolve with rest ([P-33], [P-34]); (2) that she is on no regular medications ([P-46], [P-47]); and (3) the past viral infections did not require antibiotics ([P-16]). Thus, coverage is substantial but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (seasonal allergies, occasional Reactine/OTC use, and no prescribed medications). No clear hallucinations or unverifiable details are present.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on medications/treatments and whether any prescribed medication is part of management, which directly answers the question. It could be more fully responsive by mentioning the lack of treatment for the respiratory episodes."
