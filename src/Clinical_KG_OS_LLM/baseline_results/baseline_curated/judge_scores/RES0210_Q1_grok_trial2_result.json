  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer where it overlaps; all described symptoms (fever from P-5, chills P-9, right chest pain P-17, worse with deep breath P-18, yellow custard sputum with red spots P-6, cough P-1, raw throat P-15) match the transcript and Gold's details without contradictions or errors, though it uses 'pleuritic' as a reasonable clinical interpretation supported by the description.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: sputum description (yellow custard with red spots), chills, right-sided chest pain (location and partial quality - worse with deep breath/cough), fever (briefly), cough; partially covers chest pain quality (misses constant, dull, present lying down), systemic fever details (start Monday, subjective, persisting); misses cough timeline (Friday raspy, Sunday severe), sputum start simultaneous, full dyspnea on exertion details, sore throat as additional (included but Gold lists it), runny nose, no weight loss; covers ~60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the cited transcript sections: fever in P-5 ('started getting fever'), chills P-9, right pain P-17, deep breath P-18, sputum quote from P-6, cough P-1, raw throat P-15; no hallucinations, 'pleuritic' is a grounded inference from description; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by structuring around systemic symptoms (fever/chills), chest pain (location right, quality pleuritic/worse deep breath), sputum (yellow custard with red spots), and relevant respiratory symptoms like cough and raw throat, with no off-topic content."
