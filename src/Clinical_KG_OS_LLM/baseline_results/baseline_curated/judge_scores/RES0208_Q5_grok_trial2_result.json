  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately details the grandson exposure [P-23], symptom timing [P-1], doctor's acknowledgment [D-24], exclusion of travel [D-24, P-24], exclusion of recent client visits [D-32, P-32], and conclusion supporting infection [D-36]. Generated Answer correctly identifies grandson exposure [P-23] and links to infection assessment [D-36], but hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph' not present, and factually errs by claiming no evidence in transcript for exploring/excluding travel or client visits, directly contradicting transcript (D-24 for travel, D-32/P-32 for clients) and Gold Answer. Significant contradictions on key exposure exclusions warrant score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: grandson visit/daycare/cold details [P-23]; symptom onset post-visit [P-1]; doctor acknowledgment [D-24]; travel excluded [D-24/P-24]; recent client visits excluded [P-31/D-32/P-32]; grandson as likely source for infection [D-36]. Generated covers grandson exposure and general infection link but misses symptom timing, doctor acknowledgment phrasing, all details on travel and client exclusions (claims absent), and explicit conclusion on source. Covers ~30-40% (mainly grandson), misses core exclusions. Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verifies grandson cold/daycare [P-23], symptoms [P-1/P-4/etc.], infection assessment [D-36]. Generated citations [P-23/D-36] accurate, but 'Knowledge Graph' fully hallucinated (absent). Claims 'no evidence' for travel/client exploration false—transcript has D-24 (travel outside province?), D-32 (recent client visits?). Multiple inaccuracies/hallucinations (denial of clear transcript content). Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Question has two parts: grandson connection to infection assessment; other pathways (travel/clients) explored/excluded. Generated addresses both directly (first well, second incorrectly but attempts answer), structured response, no major tangents. Score: 4."
