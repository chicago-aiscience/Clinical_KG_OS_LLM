  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the mother-reported respiratory symptoms present in the transcript: wheezing [P-1, P-2], slight cough [P-1], and shortness of breath/difficulty taking deep breaths [P-1, P-2]. It correctly states that wheezing (and difficulty taking deep breaths) were the earliest symptoms at onset [P-2], and appropriately infers the cough appeared later from “and now she has a slight cough” [P-1]. No statements conflict with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer covers the core symptom triad at presentation (wheeze, SOB, cough) and the earliest symptoms (wheeze + difficulty taking deep breaths). However, it omits additional respiratory symptom descriptions emphasized in the Gold Answer: exertional dyspnea/“quite out of breath” with activity [P-3], “hard time catching her breath” during episodes and denial of cyanosis [P-32], and the cough being non-productive (no phlegm) [P-31]. Thus it captures the main points but not all key symptom details included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript and the provided citations are appropriate (wheeze [P-1/P-2/P-43], cough [P-1], SOB/deep breaths [P-1/P-2], onset timeline [P-2], cough later [P-1]). No clear hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on respiratory symptoms and which appeared earliest, directly answering the question without tangential content."
