  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the quality as 'sharp and strong' pain on deep breath (matches Gold [P-3]), duration of episodes as 20 minutes (matches Gold [P-6, P-7]), occurrence during walking alone or studying (matches Gold [P-4, P-29]), and resolution when engaged socially or in tasks (matches Gold [P-9, P-29]). Minor discrepancies include omitting the overall 1.5-week duration, initial 'uncomfortable/odd' description, at-rest occurrence, no worsening with exercise, no injury, and first-time nature; it adds a link to nervousness/rapid breathing [P-19] which is plausible but not emphasized in Gold as part of quality. Core facts align without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covered: quality (sharp/strong on deep breath), episode duration (20 min), intermittent nature implied, occurrence (walking/studying alone), resolution (when engaged with people/manual tasks). Missed from Gold: total symptom duration (1.5 weeks), initial quality descriptors ('uncomfortable/odd'), explicit at-rest confirmation, no worsening with exercise/walking same, no preceding injury, no prior episodes. Covers core question elements (~80-90% of Gold's key points focused on quality/duration/situations).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: sharp pain on breath [P-3], nervousness/breathing [P-19], 20 min [P-6], stress/father [P-8], situations [P-29], resolution/manual tasks/talking [P-29, P-20 contextually supports anxiety link]. No hallucinations; interpretations grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question's specified aspects (quality, duration, occur/resolve situations) with bullet points directly addressing each; no off-topic content."
