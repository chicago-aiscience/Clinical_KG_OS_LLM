  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states Jessica is 'currently taking Claritin' when the transcript and Gold Answer clarify she carries it 'just in case' but is not actively taking it [P-25]. It completely omits the birth control 'Deyo' (oral contraceptive pill for three months) [P-25-P-28], a key current medication. Past treatments mention allergy shots correctly but omit dosing details ('once a week for a little while, in winter') [P-20] and no EpiPen [P-21]. Minor stretch on doctor's note about allergies flaring [D-58] is not fully accurate. Significant factual errors and omissions contradict Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: Claritin for seasonal allergies (partial, wrong status), allergy shots from allergist in some years. Missed: Deyo birth control (name, indication, dosing), Claritin carrying status, no medication allergies, allergy shots dosing/frequency/timing, no EpiPen, allergy severity details. Covers roughly 20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in transcript: Claritin [P-16, P-25], seasonal allergies [P-16], shots [P-16], family history [P-33]. Doctor's summary reference [D-58] is mostly accurate but interpretive. No hallucinations, citations correct where used, minor unverifiable phrasing on allergy timing but plausible.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses current medications (Claritin) and past allergist treatments (shots) with structure matching question's request for names, indications, dosing. No off-topic content, perfectly focused despite incompleteness."
