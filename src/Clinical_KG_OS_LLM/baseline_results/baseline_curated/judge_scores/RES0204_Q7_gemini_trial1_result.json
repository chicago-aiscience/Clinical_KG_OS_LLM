  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript and gold answer. It correctly identifies the duration of the cough (4-5 days), the onset of the runny nose (past couple of days), and the static severity of the cough. It also correctly notes the lack of fever and asthma symptoms during this episode compared to medical history.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a specific detail from the gold answer regarding the comparison to prior experiences. Specifically, it misses the patient's statement in [P-24] that he had never had a dry cough like this before and that while he had runny noses in the past, they never lasted as long as this one. The generated answer instead focuses on fever and asthma history.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript. Citations for the cough [P-2], runny nose [P-11], fever history [P-13], and asthma history [P-28] are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the development of symptoms over time, the relative timing of the cough and runny nose, the severity of the cough, and comparisons to prior health history."
