  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID swab, the 14-day isolation period, the condition for contact tracing (positive result), and all supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics, and Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses all four specific components requested in the prompt. Compared to the Gold Answer, it misses the specific timeframe for test results (24-48 hours) mentioned in [D-52], which is a relevant detail of the diagnostic plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript, specifically [D-52]. It even preserves the transcript's spelling of 'anseads' (though the Gold Answer correctly identifies these as NSAIDs), showing no hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response is perfectly relevant, structured according to the specific categories requested in the question without any extraneous information."
