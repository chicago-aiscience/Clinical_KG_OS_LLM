  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated answer correctly links Jessica’s dry, non-productive cough, scratchy throat, subjective fever/feeling hot, and headache to a URI pattern and correctly uses absence of sputum, GI symptoms, and joint pain to support the assessment, broadly consistent with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces an unsupported claim that a “knowledge graph explicitly defines dry cough and fever as indicators” and that these are “sufficient” for diagnosis—this is not part of the Gold Answer and overstates diagnostic certainty. Minor imprecision: it frames D-58 as the doctor “asking” about bringing anything up, whereas the transcript earlier clearly documents no sputum at P-5/P-6 (and D-58 is a summary).",
    "completeness": "Covers: dry cough duration, scratchy throat, subjective fever/feeling hot, headache, absence of sputum, absence of GI symptoms, absence of joint pain.\nMisses from Gold: explicit mention of malaise (P-14/D-15), fatigue (P-13), the typical URI timeline framing, the household exposure (brother’s cold) as supportive context, and that the doctor summarized/framed next steps accordingly. Overall partial but not full coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the provided transcript: references to a “knowledge graph” and its definitional claims are fabricated; discussion of ruling out bronchitis/pneumonia and influenza is plausible clinical reasoning but not explicitly stated in the transcript. Core symptom citations (dry cough, feeling hot, scratchy throat, headache, no GI symptoms, no joint pain, no sputum) are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response largely addresses how the symptom pattern and notable negatives support a URI assessment. The “knowledge graph” section is a minor tangent/unnecessary for answering the question but does not derail the overall focus."
