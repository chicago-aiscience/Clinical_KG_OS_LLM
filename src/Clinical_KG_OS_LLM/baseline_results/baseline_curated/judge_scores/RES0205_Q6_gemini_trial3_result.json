  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the doctor's plan, the physical examination components (heart and lungs, quick physical exam), and the process for next steps (consulting the supervising physician, reviewing the discussion, and returning to the patient). These facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all the primary components asked for in the question (exam parts and the consultative process). It misses some contextual details provided in the Gold Answer, specifically the reference to the plan being foreshadowed at the beginning of the encounter (D-1), the patient's agreement (P-37), and the observation that no diagnosis was yet provided due to the doctor's trainee status.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, specifically referencing D-37 for its claims without any hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly relevant and focused. It answers the three specific parts of the prompt without including any extraneous information."
