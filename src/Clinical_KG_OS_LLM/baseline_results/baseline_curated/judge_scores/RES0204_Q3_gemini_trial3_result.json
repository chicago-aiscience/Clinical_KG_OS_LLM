  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the reasoning for the chest X-ray (persistent cough, needing a 'better look') and the COVID swab (institutional protocol for respiratory symptoms). It accurately reflects the patient's lack of asthma history and the pertinent negatives regarding fever and chest pain.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but omits several pertinent negatives mentioned in the gold answer, such as the absence of a sore throat, muscle pain, headaches, sick contacts, and travel history. While it addresses the core logic, it is less exhaustive in listing the specific absent findings that the prompt requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It uses direct quotes correctly (e.g., [P-2], [D-37], [D-39]) and accurately attributes the source material. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question. It structures the response specifically around the two diagnostic tests requested (CXR and COVID swab) and explains the clinical reasoning for each."
