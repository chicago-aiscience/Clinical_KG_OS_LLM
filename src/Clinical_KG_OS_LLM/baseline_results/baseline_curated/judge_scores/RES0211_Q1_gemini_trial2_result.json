  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies several reported symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, fever). However, it fails significantly on the second part of the question. It claims the transcript contains no information regarding nausea, joint pain, or rashes, and that Jessica did not explicitly deny them. In reality, the transcript shows explicit denials for sputum/phlegm [P-5, P-6], rashes [P-10], nausea/vomiting [P-11], and joint aches [P-13]. It also incorrectly attributes 'post nasal drip' as a current symptom when the patient was describing her typical allergy symptoms which she stated she does not have 'right now' [P-16].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key reported symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as feeling 'crappy/icky' (malaise) and feeling 'tired'. More importantly, it completely fails to cover the list of denied symptoms, which was a specific requirement of the prompt, covering 0% of that section of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant negative hallucination by claiming that information regarding nausea, joint pain, and rashes is not in the transcript. These are explicitly discussed and denied by the patient in the source text. It also misinterprets the discussion of post-nasal drip as a current symptom.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly attempting to answer both parts of the question (reported vs denied symptoms), even though the content of the second part is factually incorrect based on the provided text."
