{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to be ruled out and correctly states that a COVID swab was ordered for that purpose, consistent with D-43. It also accurately cites the prompting social-contact history: meeting friends for outdoor dog walks, one friend being sick, and sometimes walking too close (P-20). No statements contradict the transcript or Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core elements in the Gold Answer that directly answer the question: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) order COVID swab, (3) sick friend during outdoor dog walks with close proximity. It omits the additional Gold Answer detail that the patient was unsure whether the friend had a COVID test (P-21) and does not mention other COVID screening questions (smell/taste, travel, etc.), though those are not strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the cited transcript lines (D-43, P-20). No apparent hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the asked items (condition, test, and social-contact detail) with no extraneous content."
