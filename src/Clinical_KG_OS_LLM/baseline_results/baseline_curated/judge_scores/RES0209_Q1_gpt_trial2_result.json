  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient’s dry cough (“pretty dry,” “almost nonstop throughout the day”), shortness of breath, and wheezing (“wheezing a lot”), and correctly contrasts daytime predominance with less frequent nighttime symptoms (“every other day / every two days”). A minor issue is framing nighttime symptoms as “specifically wheezing,” whereas the transcript indicates nighttime “symptoms” generally (with later discussion linking episodes to coughing/wheezing and breathing difficulty). No direct contradictions with the Gold Answer otherwise.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) dry, near-nonstop daytime cough; (2) shortness of breath; (3) wheezing; (4) daytime vs nighttime frequency including every-other-day/every-2-days nighttime pattern and that nights are less frequent than days. Missing from Gold Answer: (a) cough duration (~2 weeks) and explicit non-productive characterization (“bringing up gunk” discussion); (b) description of breathing difficulty during episodes/when wheezing is severe (“hard time breathing”); (c) wheezing occurring more frequently than bronchodilator use; (d) chest tightness confirmation. Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements made are grounded in cited transcript lines (P-1, P-15, P-18). The only slight over-specification is labeling nighttime symptoms as ‘nighttime wheezing’ rather than general nighttime symptoms, but it remains broadly consistent with the transcript and does not introduce clear fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested symptom domains (cough character, breathing difficulty, wheeze) and day vs night frequency. However, it omits the requested ‘chest sensations’ component (chest tightness), reducing how fully it addresses the prompt."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate and on-topic but misses several key symptom details from the Gold Answer—most notably chest tightness and other qualifying descriptors—making it only partially complete."
