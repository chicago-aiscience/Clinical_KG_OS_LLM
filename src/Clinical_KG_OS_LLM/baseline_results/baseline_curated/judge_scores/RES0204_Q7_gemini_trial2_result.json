{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript and Gold Answer regarding the timeline (4-5 days for the cough, past couple of days for the runny nose) and the severity (persisted without getting better or worse). The mention of fever history vs. current state and asthma history are also factually supported by the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points: the onset of the dry cough, the relative timing of the runny nose, and the static severity of the cough. However, it misses the specific direct comparison provided by the patient in [P-24] regarding this being his first experience with a dry cough of this type and the fact that his prior runny noses never lasted this long. These were key comparative details in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. It correctly identifies the duration of symptoms and references specific sections like P-2, P-11, P-13, and P-28. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question, organizing the response into logical sections that match the query's requirements."
