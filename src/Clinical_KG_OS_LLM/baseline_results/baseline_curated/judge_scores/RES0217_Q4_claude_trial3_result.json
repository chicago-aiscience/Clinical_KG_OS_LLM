  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all clinical features assessed by the doctor (bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/illness, headaches) and correctly identifies them as absent. It also accurately lists all three proposed diagnostic tests (tick species identification, serology blood work, physical exam). The specific dialogue citations match the Gold Answer and are factually correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major clinical features and diagnostic tests mentioned in the Gold Answer. However, it omits a few minor details: (1) the patient's confirmation of 'feeling well otherwise' and being 'totally fine' as summarized assessment, (2) the mention of no other bites found on patient or husband, (3) the doctor's plan to consult a supervising physician, and (4) the note that no test results were available during consultation. These represent approximately 15-20% of the Gold Answer's detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The dialogue references [D-6], [P-6], [D-7], [D-8], [D-19], [D-18] all correctly support the statements made. No hallucinated facts are present. The answer appropriately uses specific transcript evidence and the 'knowledge graph' reference appears to be a formatting artifact rather than hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) specific clinical features assessed and found absent, and (2) diagnostic tests proposed. The response is well-organized with clear headers separating these two components. All content is directly relevant to the question with no tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and highly relevant response with precise citations from the transcript. It correctly identifies all major clinical features assessed (bullseye rash, joint pain, fever, headaches) as absent and accurately lists the three proposed diagnostic tests (tick identification, serology, physical exam). The response loses only minor points for completeness, omitting some contextual details like the patient's overall wellness confirmation, absence of other bites, physician consultation plan, and note about test availability. No factual errors or hallucinations are present, and the structure effectively addresses both parts of the clinical question."
