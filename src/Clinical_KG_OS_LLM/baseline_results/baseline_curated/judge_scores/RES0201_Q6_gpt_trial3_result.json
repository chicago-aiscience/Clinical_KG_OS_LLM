{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer on all core factual elements: (1) assessment that symptoms are in line with common COVID-19 symptoms [D-43]; (2) plan for a COVID swab [D-43]; (3) plan for a chest X-ray [D-43]; (4) instruction to isolate until results return [D-43]; and (5) continued isolation may be needed even if the test is negative if symptoms persist [D-43]. No contradictions or clinically important errors relative to the Gold Answer were identified.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key items asked in the question and reflected in the Gold Answer: overall COVID-symptom-consistent assessment, the two diagnostic tests (COVID swab + chest X-ray), isolation until results, and continued isolation if still symptomatic despite a negative test. It omits secondary/contextual points present in the Gold Answer (e.g., that the clinician would consult with the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps [D-1, D-44], and patient acknowledgment), which slightly reduces completeness versus the full Gold Answer narrative.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, particularly [D-43]. It does not introduce additional unsupported tests, diagnoses, or instructions. No hallucinated details detected.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by summarizing the assessment and management plan, explicitly listing diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, and the condition for continued isolation after results. No notable off-topic content."
