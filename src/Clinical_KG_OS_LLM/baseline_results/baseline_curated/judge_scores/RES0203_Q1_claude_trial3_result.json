  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding taste loss. It states 'complete loss of taste' when the Gold Answer (and transcript P-4) clearly indicates partial loss - the patient could taste 'really, really salty foods.' The smell loss characterization as 'partial' is correct but incomplete, lacking the specific detail that very strong bad smells could still be detected. The dry cough description is accurate but lacks details about consistency and onset timing.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only 40-50% of the Gold Answer's key points. It misses: (1) the 2-day duration, (2) specific examples of what could/couldn't be perceived (very bad smells, salty foods, banana), (3) consistency of symptoms over time, (4) simultaneous onset of all symptoms, (5) non-productive nature of cough with no sputum/blood, (6) consistent severity without worsening, and (7) absence of cough triggers. Only basic symptom categories are mentioned.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript but contains one critical misrepresentation. The claim of 'complete loss' of taste contradicts P-4 where the patient explicitly describes partial taste ability ('I can taste really, really salty foods'). The other statements are verifiable in P-1, though they omit important qualifying details found in subsequent exchanges (P-4, P-5, P-6, P-7, P-8).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying sensory and respiratory symptoms and attempting to characterize their degree. However, it fails to include the critical second part of the question asking for 'details the patient provided about what they could and could not still perceive,' which is central to the question's intent."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three main symptoms but contains a critical factual error by stating taste loss was 'complete' when it was actually partial. It severely lacks completeness, missing specific details about perception thresholds (very bad smells, salty foods, banana example), symptom duration, consistency, onset timing, and cough characteristics. While mostly grounded in the transcript, the taste loss mischaracterization and omission of key qualifying details from P-4 reduce faithfulness. The answer partially addresses relevance by naming symptoms but fails to adequately answer what the patient could and could not perceive, which was explicitly requested."
