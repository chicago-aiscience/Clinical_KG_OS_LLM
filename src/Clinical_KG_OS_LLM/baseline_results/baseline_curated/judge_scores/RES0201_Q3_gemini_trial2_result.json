  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual contradiction. It states the patient 'admitted to loss of smell,' whereas the transcript [P-19], the Gold Answer, and even the question itself explicitly state there was no loss of smell (only reduced taste). It also incorrectly interprets the doctor's statement in [D-43] as referring specifically to only sore throat and breathing, while the Gold Answer notes the doctor screened for a wider constellation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it omits the generalized muscle aches and fatigue [P-25], the specific durations and onset timings of the symptoms (e.g., 4 days for sore throat, 1 day for breathing), and the potential exposure settings like grocery stores and banks [P-12].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates. It references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source transcript or context. More importantly, it claims the patient reported a 'loss of smell,' which is a direct fabrication contradicting the transcript [P-19] where the patient says 'but not smell.'",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it fails to address the specific condition of the question: 'how does the presence of reduced taste WITHOUT loss of smell... support this reasoning?' Instead of answering this, it provides an answer based on the opposite (and false) premise that there was a loss of smell."
