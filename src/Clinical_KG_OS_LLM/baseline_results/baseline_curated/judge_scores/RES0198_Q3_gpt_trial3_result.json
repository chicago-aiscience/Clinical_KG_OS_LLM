  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the clinician’s conclusion of a viral URI/common cold (cites [D-39]) and accurately repeats key timeline elements (about 1 week; cites [P-1]) and the daycare-related exposure history ([P-11]). However, it overstates the role of daycare as a “critical factor” and, more importantly, it does not correctly substantiate the *viral vs allergic vs bacterial* distinction using the visit’s discriminating symptom features (e.g., clear discharge, absence of fever/cough/sore throat). The introduction of a “knowledge graph” and claims about what it links are not part of the case and thus undermine factual grounding (though this is primarily a faithfulness issue). Overall, core facts it does state are mostly accurate, but the differential-supporting evidence is not correctly developed.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key supports include: (1) absence of cough and other systemic/lower respiratory symptoms (no cough, sore throat, SOB, fever/chills, post-nasal drip), (2) clear nasal discharge/no colored discharge, (3) duration/constancy consistent with viral URI, (4) progression stuffy→runny, (5) against allergy: no allergen exposures and no known allergies and no similar recurrent episodes, (6) against bacterial: no fever/headache and clear (not colored) discharge, (7) daycare exposure as possible viral source.\n\nGenerated Answer covers: duration (partial), daycare exposure, and the doctor’s explicit assessment. It omits nearly all the discriminating symptom/absence features (clear discharge; no fever/cough/sore throat; no allergen exposure; no allergies; no headache; symptom progression). This is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated references to a “provided knowledge graph,” claims that the knowledge graph explicitly links daycare exposure to viral infection, and that Tylenol cold/supportive care are linked to viral infections in that knowledge graph. These elements are fabricated relative to the provided transcript. The rest of the content (symptoms, duration, daycare attendance, clinician conclusion) is supported by cited lines.",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally on-topic (attempts to justify viral vs other causes), but it does not directly address the question’s requested evidence set (discharge quality; absent features; allergic/bacterial distinguishing points) and includes a minor tangent about a knowledge graph. Still, most of what it discusses is related to the diagnostic reasoning."
