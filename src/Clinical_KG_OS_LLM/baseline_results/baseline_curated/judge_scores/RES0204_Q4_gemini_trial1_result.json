  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition as asthma and lists the specific clinical findings (shortness of breath and wheezing) correctly. It also correctly notes the context of physical activity. However, it contains a factual error regarding the transcript citation, attributing the family history report to turn [P-13] (which is about fevers) rather than [P-28].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key requirements of the prompt: the condition (asthma), the reason it was considered (family history), and the specific findings used to rule it out (absence of SOB and wheezing during physical activity). It misses the supplementary point in the Gold Answer regarding the patient's statement about his history of dry coughs ([P-24]), but the core requirements are met.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is mostly grounded in the transcript, but the citation [P-13] is an error/hallucination as that turn discusses fevers, not family history of asthma. The rest of the claims regarding the 'work up' and activity-related symptoms are faithfully extracted from [P-28].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question with clear bullet points and bold text for emphasis."
