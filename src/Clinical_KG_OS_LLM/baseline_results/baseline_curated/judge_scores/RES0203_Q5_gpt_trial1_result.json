  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key exposure event noted in the Gold Answer: hiking with their partner ~2 weeks prior and having close proximity contact (“some people kind of brushed by us”) [P-18]. It also correctly links suspicion for COVID-19 to the patient’s symptoms (anosmia/ageusia and dry cough) and the clinician’s statement that symptoms are consistent with COVID-19 [D-39]. However, it introduces an unsupported claim about a “Knowledge Graph” explicitly indicating hiking exposure -> COVID-19, which is not present in the transcript or Gold Answer and could be misleading.",
    "completeness": "It captures the main exposure event (hike with brief close contact) and connects suspicion to symptom consistency. It omits several Gold Answer elements that contextualize the exposure history: the patient is attending high school online and has mostly stayed home [P-36–P-38], denied known contact with anyone sick [P-17], could not identify other exposures (“don’t see where else…”) [P-18], lives with parents/sibling without reported household illness [P-29], and that testing/self-isolation was recommended due to symptoms [D-39].",
    "faithfulness": "The hiking exposure and symptom-based rationale are grounded in the transcript. The “Knowledge Graph Link” statement is hallucinated/unverifiable (not in transcript) and reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements (specific exposure event and how it relates to suspected COVID-19). The “Knowledge Graph” content is unnecessary and slightly distracting but still tangentially tied to the diagnosis."
