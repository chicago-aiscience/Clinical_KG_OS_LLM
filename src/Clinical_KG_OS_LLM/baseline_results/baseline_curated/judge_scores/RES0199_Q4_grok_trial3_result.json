  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab as the test, 24-48 hours as TAT, and another viral illness as the alternative, all matching the Gold Answer's core facts and transcript [D-52]. No contradictions or errors in factual content compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) rule out COVID-19 ✓, (2) swab test ✓, (3) 24-48h TAT ✓, (4) isolate 14 days ✗, (5) public health contact tracing if positive ✗, (6) alternative viral illness ✓, (7) supportive management either way ✗. Covers ~57% (4/7 key points), fitting 50-79%.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims (condition, test, TAT, alternative) verifiable in [D-52]; symptoms mentioned (headache, cough, loss of smell) are in transcript (e.g., [P-1],[P-12],[P-24]); citations accurate. However, 'knowledge graph' references and links (e.g., symptoms to COVID, hydration treatment via KG) are not in transcript, though plausible—minor unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured in bullets directly addressing each part of the question (condition, test, TAT, alternative); minor tangents (symptom explanation, KG) do not detract significantly."
