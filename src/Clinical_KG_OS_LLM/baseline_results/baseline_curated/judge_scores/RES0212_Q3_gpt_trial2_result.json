  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s overall diagnostic direction (“respiratory infection”) is broadly consistent with the Gold Answer’s conclusion of an acute lower respiratory tract infection (acute bronchitis vs early community-acquired pneumonia). However, it is less specific than the Gold Answer and overstates the significance of green sputum by implying it indicates infection (and by leaning on an unspecified “Knowledge Graph”), whereas the Gold Answer explicitly notes green sputum is not definitive for bacterial infection. It also implies the doctor in D-47 reached a clinical conclusion of infection; in the transcript D-47 is a summary, not a diagnostic statement.",
    "completeness": "It addresses all three requested features (productive cough, green sputum, subjective fever) and links each to an infectious process. It misses several key Gold Answer elements: (1) specifying acute lower respiratory tract infection with likely acute bronchitis vs possible early pneumonia, (2) noting this is superimposed on a pre-existing chronic cough, (3) clarifying that green sputum alone does not confirm bacterial infection, (4) using absence of night sweats/weight loss/hemoptysis as supporting context to distinguish from more serious chronic disease, and (5) noting lack of vitals/exam/imaging/labs to confirm diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated references to a “Knowledge Graph” and claims that it explicitly states green sputum/subjective fever indicate respiratory infection. The transcript contains no knowledge graph and does not provide those interpretive rules. The statement that D-47 “arrive[s] at the clinical conclusion of a respiratory infection” is also not directly supported (D-47 summarizes symptoms).",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the question: it proposes a unifying diagnosis and explains how productive cough, sputum color, and subjective fever support it. The main minor distraction is the repeated, unnecessary reliance on a non-provided “Knowledge Graph.”"
