{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the duration of the cough (4-5 days), its lack of improvement, the doctor's rationale for the chest X-ray ('get a better look'), and the institutional protocol for the COVID swab. It accurately reflects the patient's lack of asthma despite family history.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the major key points: the persistent cough, the lack of fever/chills/anosmia, the institutional protocol for COVID swabs, and the rationale for imaging. However, it misses several 'pertinent negatives' mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of sore throat, back/muscle pain, headaches, abdominal pain, sick contacts, and travel history.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All citations (e.g., [P-2], [D-37], [D-39]) are accurate and the interpretation of the dialogue (such as the doctor's validation of smell/taste) is grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, focusing specifically on how the combination of present symptoms and absent symptoms led to the specific diagnostic workup requested in the prompt."
