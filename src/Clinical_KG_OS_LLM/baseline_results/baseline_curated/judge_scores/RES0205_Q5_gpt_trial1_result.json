  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Matches Gold Answer on the three main potentially relevant factors: reflux, hay fever/allergic history, and hospital workplace exposure.\n- Correctly notes reflux is managed with dietary avoidance and that reflux can contribute to cough.\n- Correctly notes hospital setting implies higher infectious exposure and acknowledges PPE use.\n- Minor/meaningful overstatement: it claims the occupational environment “likely served as the initial trigger” and that infection “may not have fully cleared,” which is not supported by the transcript or Gold Answer (Gold is more cautious and emphasizes a post-viral pattern rather than ongoing infection).\n- Also implies hay fever is likely contributing/prolonging, whereas Gold explicitly notes no current allergy symptoms described.\nOverall: core facts align, but there are some speculative causal statements beyond Gold/transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered:\n- Acid reflux history and potential contribution to persistent cough (covered).\n- Hay fever history as airway sensitivity (covered).\n- Hospital clerk occupational exposure and PPE use (covered).\n- URI symptoms resolved while cough persisted (covered).\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed or weakened:\n- Gold emphasizes reflux is not pharmacologically treated (patient not on meds), suggesting incomplete control (Generated mentions diet but does not clearly highlight absence of medication as a reason control may be incomplete).\n- Gold explicitly states there are no current allergy symptoms described (Generated instead implies likely contribution).\n- Gold includes the post-viral cough framing explicitly (Generated implies it but mixes in “not fully cleared infection”).\n- Gold includes anxiety/context for care-seeking and coworkers’ fear (Generated omits anxiety and the social/anxiety context).\n\nOverall coverage is good for the main clinical factors but misses several important qualifiers/context points from Gold.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are grounded in transcript (duration, dry cough, resolved URI symptoms, reflux history and diet changes, hay fever, hospital job, PPE, COVID test).\n- However, it introduces several inferences not supported by the transcript: that the hospital was likely the initial trigger, that the infection may not have fully cleared, and that hay fever likely contributed to prolongation. These are plausible but not directly evidenced and go beyond Gold’s more cautious framing.\n- No direct fabrication of new concrete events, but multiple causal attributions are speculative.\nOverall: partially grounded with some notable unsupported inferences.",
    "relevance": "- Directly addresses how reflux, hay fever, and hospital work could relate to a cough persisting after other URI symptoms.\n- Minimal tangential content; stays focused on the question."
