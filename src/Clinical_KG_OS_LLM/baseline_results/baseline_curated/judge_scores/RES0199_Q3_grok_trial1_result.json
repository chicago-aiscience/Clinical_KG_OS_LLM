  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's suspicion of COVID-19 based on symptom overlap [D-52] and lists headache, cough, and loss of smell as part of the combination, which aligns with the Gold Answer's core facts. It accurately notes loss of smell as the characteristic symptom. Minor discrepancies include omitting gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), fatigue, and pertinent negatives from the Gold Answer's constellation, and introducing a 'knowledge graph' not present in the Gold or transcript, but no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points covered: doctor's explicit statement to rule out COVID [D-52] (covered), symptoms including dry cough (cough mentioned but not specified as dry), persistent headache with location (covered), loss of smell/anosmia as characteristic (fully covered). Missed: full GI symptoms details (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea [P-1,P-28,P-32]), fatigue [P-19], doctor's question on smell/taste [D-24], alternative viral illness [D-52], pertinent negatives (no fever, no runny nose, no aches). Covers approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like headache location [P-5], cough onset [P-1], loss of smell [P-24], doctor's statement [D-52] are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. Cough is dry [P-12] but not specified as such. Hallucination: 'knowledge graph explicitly links loss of smell to covid-19 diagnosis' not in transcript. Symptom overlap reasoning is plausible and grounded, but the external 'knowledge graph' reference is unverifiable, leading to some ungrounded details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by specifying the symptom combination (headache, cough, loss of smell) leading to COVID suspicion and identifying loss of smell as the characteristic symptom versus other virals, with structured focus and no off-topic content."
