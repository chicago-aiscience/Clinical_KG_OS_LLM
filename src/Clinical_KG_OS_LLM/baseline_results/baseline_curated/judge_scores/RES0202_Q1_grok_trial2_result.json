  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures most reported symptoms like dry cough (with progression), fever details, fatigue, runny nose, loss of taste, and reduced appetite, matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly lists 'trouble swallowing' as a reported symptom when the Gold notes uncertainty [P-15]. Critically, it wrongly states that none of the specific symptoms (wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, GI complaints) were explicitly asked about and denied, directly contradicting the Gold and transcript where the doctor did ask and mother denied them (e.g., wheezing [D-7/P-7], sore throat [D-14/P-14], chest pain [D-13/P-13], chills [D-19/P-19], GI [D-22/P-22, D-23/P-23]). It also fabricates denials for seizures/dizziness with incorrect citations [D-44 misapplied, P-32 unrelated]. Misses shortness of breath uncertainty [P-8] and many pertinent negatives. Significant factual errors and contradictions warrant a score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Key reported points from Gold covered: dry cough/progression, fever, fatigue, runny nose, decreased appetite, possible loss of taste (6/7, misses SOB uncertain). Adds uncertain swallowing as positive. For denied symptoms (core second half of question): covers 0% of Gold's explicit list (sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, rashes, GI specifics, etc.), instead listing irrelevant future warnings. Covers ~40-50% overall key points, score of 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Most reported symptoms verifiable with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-16], [P-17]). Runny nose/mild per [P-16]. However, swallowing not affirmatively reported. Major issues: falsely claims specific symptoms not asked (verifiable asks/denials exist, e.g., [D-7/P-7 No wheezing]); hallucinates current denials for seizures/dizziness/fainting from [D-44] (future advice, not history) and mis-cites [P-32] (allergies, not relevant). Multiple unverifiable/wrong claims and citations indicate score of 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and doctor's questions/denials, mirroring the question's two parts with relevant headings. No off-topic content, minor confusion on denials doesn't derail focus. Score of 4."
