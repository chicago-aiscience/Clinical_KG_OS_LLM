  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error regarding the most bothersome symptom. It identifies shortness of breath as the primary/most bothersome symptom, whereas the transcript [P-12] and Gold Answer explicitly state the cough was the most bothersome. It also fails to mention sinus pressure, headache, and reduced exercise tolerance as reported symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key symptoms included in the Gold Answer, specifically sinus pressure, headache, and reduced exercise tolerance (walking the dog). It also omits all pertinent negatives (denial of sore throat, nausea, etc.) which were part of the comprehensive Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contradicts the transcript. While the patient does emphasize her difficulty breathing in [P-1], she explicitly identifies the cough as the 'most bothersome' in [P-12]. The generated answer's claim about the 'primary symptom' is a hallucination of the patient's stated priority.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the structure of the question, providing sections for respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, and the most bothersome symptom, though the content within those sections is flawed or incomplete."
