  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states symptoms began about a week prior and that both congestion and runny nose were present. However, it misidentifies/weakly supports key chronological details: (1) it cites decongestant use [P-10] to justify that congestion was first, when the transcript explicitly answers this at [P-3] (“stuffy at first, but now it’s mostly running”); (2) it implies the shift to rhinorrhea is mainly evidenced by [P-10] rather than the clear statement at [P-3]; and (3) it states symptoms were “on and off rather than constant,” contradicting the patient’s clarification that symptoms have been “pretty constant for the past week” [P-8]. These are significant factual discrepancies relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key elements from the Gold Answer are missing or inadequately captured: the explicit first symptom (stuffy first) and predominant-symptom shift (now mostly running) should be based on [P-3]; the important constant-vs-intermittent clarification ([P-1] ‘on and off’ vs [P-8] ‘pretty constant’) is not included and is instead contradicted; the notion that symptoms were not improving/prompted the visit is not mentioned; the possible influence of decongestants is not framed as partial influence and is overused as primary evidence. Overall, it captures only part of the required progression.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not well-grounded or are grounded incorrectly: reference to a “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript; the causal/temporal reasoning that decongestant use shows congestion was first is not supported; and the statement that symptoms were on-and-off rather than constant conflicts with the direct transcript statement of being constant [P-8]. Citations are misapplied (e.g., using [P-10] instead of [P-3] for symptom order/predominance).",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested timeline (onset, first symptom, change over the week, constant vs intermittent). There is little extraneous content, but the key points are answered incorrectly/incompletely."
