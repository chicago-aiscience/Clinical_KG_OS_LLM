  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the symptom cluster (loss of smell, loss of taste, mild/dry cough) from P-1 and correctly states that the doctor linked these symptoms to COVID-19 in D-39 and ordered a swab test in D-39. No statements contradict the Gold Answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: (1) the three symptoms driving suspicion (anosmia, ageusia, dry cough), (2) explicit physician linkage to COVID-19 (“consistent with some common covid symptoms”), and (3) the chosen test method (swab). Missed key points from the Gold Answer: (a) that the patient themselves raised concern about COVID-19 in P-1, (b) the doctor’s systematic confirmation of absent associated symptoms (fever, dyspnea, sore throat, chest pain, etc.), and (c) the self-isolation guidance while awaiting results mentioned in D-39. Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript citations (P-1 and D-39). No hallucinated symptoms, tests, or counseling content were added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question: which symptom combination led to COVID-19 suspicion and what diagnostic test was ordered, including how the doctor connected symptoms to diagnosis and test choice. No irrelevant tangents."
