  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several factual errors. It misquotes P-11, stating 'live with who goes to daycare' when the actual text says 'I have um a nephew who I live with who goes to daycare.' It incorrectly references a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not exist in the provided materials. While it correctly identifies some key points like symptom type, duration, and daycare exposure, it omits critical diagnostic evidence such as clear discharge quality, absent features (fever, cough, colored discharge), and the distinction from allergic/bacterial causes.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers approximately 50-60% of the gold answer's key points. It mentions symptom type and duration, and daycare exposure. However, it fails to cover: (1) discharge quality being 'mostly clear' - a critical distinguishing feature, (2) absent features like fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath that rule out bacterial infection, (3) lack of allergy exposure history (no fumes, dust, animals), (4) no known allergies, (5) symptom progression from stuffy to runny, (6) absence of headache, and (7) the specific comparison against allergic and bacterial etiologies requested in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains significant unfaithful content. It references a 'Knowledge Graph' and 'provided knowledge graph' multiple times, which does not exist in the source materials. It misquotes P-11. It fabricates the claim that the knowledge graph 'explicitly links daycare exposure to viral infection/common cold.' The accurate citations it does provide (P-1, P-11, D-39) are correct, but the hallucinated knowledge graph references significantly undermine faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant. It attempts to address why the diagnosis was viral rather than allergic or bacterial, but does so incompletely. It focuses on symptom profile, duration, and exposure history, which are relevant. However, it fails to adequately distinguish viral from allergic causes (missing discussion of allergy exposure history and lack of allergies) and from bacterial causes (missing discussion of absent fever and clear vs. colored discharge). The question specifically asked for evidence supporting viral 'rather than' allergic or bacterial, requiring comparative analysis that is largely absent."

  "summary": "The generated answer partially addresses the question but has significant weaknesses. It correctly identifies some supporting evidence (symptom duration, daycare exposure, doctor's assessment) but contains factual errors (misquoting P-11), includes hallucinated content (repeated references to a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph'), and omits critical distinguishing features like clear discharge, absent fever, and lack of allergy exposures. Most importantly, it inadequately addresses the comparative aspect of the question - explaining why viral rather than allergic or bacterial - missing key evidence that rules out these alternative diagnoses. The answer covers only about half of the gold answer's key points and lacks the clinical reasoning depth needed for thorough evaluation."
