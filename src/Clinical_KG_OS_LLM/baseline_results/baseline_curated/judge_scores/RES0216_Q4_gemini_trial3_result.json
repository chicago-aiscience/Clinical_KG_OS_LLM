{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemia) and the primary symptoms (tightness vs. pain, lack of exertional breathlessness). However, it incorrectly states that these findings 'rule out' cardiac ischemia, whereas the gold answer and transcript more accurately state they place it 'lower on the differential.' Furthermore, the reference to a 'Knowledge Graph' is a hallucination of an external source not present in the provided transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the core reasoning provided by the doctor in D-36 (tightness, lack of pain, lack of breathlessness). However, it misses the additional 'pertinent negatives' cited in the gold answer, specifically the absence of anxiety, sweating, and the feeling of impending doom which were also screened to deprioritize the condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph' as the basis for its logic, which is not mentioned in the transcript. While the symptom descriptions are mostly grounded in the text, the claim that the doctor used a knowledge graph to reach a conclusion is entirely fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question (the condition and the supporting evidence)."
