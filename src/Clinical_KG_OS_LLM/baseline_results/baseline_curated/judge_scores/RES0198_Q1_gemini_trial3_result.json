  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the reported nasal symptoms (stuffy nose and runny nose). However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain a description of the nasal discharge; the transcript [P-5] explicitly describes it as 'mostly clear.' Furthermore, it incorrectly claims there is no evidence of denied symptoms, whereas the transcript shows the patient explicitly denied coughing [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat [P-7], and loss of taste/smell [P-16].",
    "completeness": "The answer only covers the first part of the question (nasal symptoms). It fails to provide the character of the discharge and fails to list any of the denied symptoms requested in the prompt, both of which are present in the Gold Answer and the source text.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits 'negative hallucinations' by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present. Specifically, it claims no qualitative descriptors or denials exist, which is contradicted by segments P-4, P-5, P-6, P-7, and P-16.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it directly addresses each component of the multi-part question. Although its conclusions are factually wrong regarding the content of the transcript, it remains focused on the prompt."
