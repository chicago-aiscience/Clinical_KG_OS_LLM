  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states all three symptoms began simultaneously two days prior, confirmed specifically for cough [D-6,P-6]; sensory losses consistent [D-5,P-5], cough consistent [D-8,P-8], no fluctuation, partial nature [P-4], no prior [D-3,P-3]. Generated Answer correctly notes all three began two days ago [P-1], no worsening/fluctuation, no prior experience, but fails to explicitly confirm simultaneity via [P-6], uses incorrect citations for prior history ([D-23,P-33] unrelated to symptoms), and overlooks direct denial in [P-3] and specific consistency statements. Core facts mostly align but with notable omissions and citation errors, warranting a 3.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: simultaneous onset of all three [P-1,P-2,D-6,P-6]; consistent sensory [D-5,P-5]; consistent cough [D-8,P-8]; no fluctuation/variable; partial sensory persisted [P-4]; no prior [D-3,P-3]. Generated covers: onset all three two days ago (~60%); no worsening/fluctuation; no prior. Misses explicit relative timing confirmation, specific consistency citations, partial nature details, doctor's COVID note. Covers 50-79% of key points, score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Onset claim grounded in [P-1]; cough mild in [P-1,P-7]; 'no specific indication' of worsening overlooks direct 'consistent' statements [P-5,P-8], but not fabricated; no prior claim grounded but citations inaccurate ([D-23] chronic conditions, [P-33] alcohol—not symptom history; direct evidence in [P-3] missed). Some claims plausible but citations wrong and key transcript evidence ignored, score 3.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly describes onset timing (all together implied), lack of worsening/fluctuation, and no prior experience, aligning with question's focus on temporal development, relative onset, changes over time, and history; minor citation issues but no off-topic content, score 4."
