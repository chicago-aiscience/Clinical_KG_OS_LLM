  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication for epilepsy, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-23, P-8]. It accurately notes the patient forgot the dose [P-9]. However, it fails to specify the detailed circumstance (daughter's birthday celebration altering dinner routine [P-24]), instead vaguely stating 'forgot' as the circumstance, which is a minor discrepancy from the Gold's precise details but core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: Keppra for epilepsy [P-23, P-8]; forgot med [P-9]; specific circumstance - daughter's birthday, early celebration, no usual dinner, completely forgot [P-24]; doctor's acknowledgment [D-25]; isolated lapse [D-24, P-24]; seizure link [P-9]. Generated covers Keppra/epilepsy and basic forgetting [P-9, P-23], but misses birthday details, dinner routine, doctor's comments, and full context (~30-40% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Keppra [P-23] and forgetting [P-9] are directly verifiable in transcript. Epilepsy context from [P-8, P-22] is grounded. However, references to 'knowledge graph link' and 'knowledge graph supports' are not present in the transcript, constituting hallucinated elements not verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by naming the medication (Keppra for epilepsy) and the reason for missing dose (forgetting), with no off-topic content."
