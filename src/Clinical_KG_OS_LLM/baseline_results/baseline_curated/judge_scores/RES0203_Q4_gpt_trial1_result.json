  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer includes some correct negatives (fever, headache, chest pain, allergies, chronic conditions) but contains several factual inaccuracies relative to the transcript/Gold Answer. It incorrectly states that dyspnea was not explicitly denied; the patient clearly answered “No” to difficulty breathing [P-11]. It similarly claims the sore throat denial is not explicit, but the patient clearly denied sore throat [P-13]. It treats chills/night sweats and muscle aches/weakness as only “likely absent,” when they were explicitly denied [P-14, P-15]. It also introduces unsupported clinical assertions (e.g., “infection…present,” “milder/earlier stage,” and ruling out meningitis/encephalitis) that are not established in the encounter. These errors meaningfully reduce factual accuracy even though the overall direction (many ROS negatives) is aligned.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer negatives missing from the Generated Answer include: no sputum production and no blood/hemoptysis with cough [D-7, P-7]; no environmental/cold triggers for cough [D-21, P-21]; no chills/night sweats and no myalgias/weakness are not properly captured as confirmed negatives (they are downgraded to “likely”); and it omits other pertinent denials noted in the Gold Answer (no medications, no prior surgeries/hospitalizations, no relevant family history). It also does not explicitly include the doctor’s summary that the patient is otherwise well [D-16] as part of the negative ROS synthesis. Overall, it covers only a subset of the full negative findings.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript and amount to speculation/hallucination: references to a “knowledge graph,” asserting that an infection is present, inferring early/mild stage based on absent fever, and suggesting absence of meningitis/encephalitis. It also incorrectly characterizes explicit denials (dyspnea, sore throat, chills/night sweats, myalgias/weakness) as non-explicit or merely implied. Because multiple claims go beyond what was said, faithfulness is substantially compromised.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the question (negative ROS findings and their clinical significance), but it includes some tangential/unsupported differential-diagnosis commentary (e.g., meningitis/encephalitis, bacterial superinfection framing, “knowledge graph”) that is not needed to answer which symptoms were screened and absent. Still, most content aims at the requested list and interpretation."
