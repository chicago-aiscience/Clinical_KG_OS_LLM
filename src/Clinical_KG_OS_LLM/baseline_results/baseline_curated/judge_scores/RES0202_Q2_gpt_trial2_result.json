{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reports the COVID swab test, the 24–48 hour turnaround time, the 14-day isolation recommendation, and that isolation should include separation from the younger sister. These are consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript (D-44). No incorrect statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "It includes the key items explicitly asked for (diagnostic test, isolation instructions and duration, and the specific household member to isolate from). However, compared with the Gold Answer’s full set of management measures, it omits several doctor-recommended elements: (1) counseling about possible false-negative swab and alternative viral illness, (2) explicit return-to-care/ER precautions (high temperature, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, fainting), and (3) the supportive/observational plan of waiting for swab results/no medications. These omissions reduce completeness versus the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (D-44). No evident hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on management, especially the diagnostic test and isolation guidance, and directly answers who the child should isolate from. No irrelevant material."
