  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly describes the key day-by-day progression consistent with the Gold Answer: cough onset Wednesday night (dry), persistence/worsening on Thursday with tiredness, and further worsening on Friday with first noted fever (~100.1–101°F) and reduced appetite with possible taste change. A minor issue is phrasing the taste symptom as more definitive (“was losing his sense of taste”) whereas the transcript reflects parental suspicion (“I wonder if he’s losing… a little bit”). It also does not explicitly distinguish that fatigue was emphasized again on Friday in the ROS, though it is mentioned as “really tired” on Thursday.",
    "completeness": "Covers most Gold Answer elements: (1) Wednesday evening/night cough onset and dry quality, (2) Thursday cough worse + tiredness, (3) Friday cough worse + fever onset with approximate temperature, (4) decreased appetite and suspected taste change. Missing/under-covered items from the Gold Answer include: mild runny nose on Friday, explicit mention of fatigue again as a systemic symptom (P-25), the mother’s explicit stepwise summary (P-12), and the correction from “five days” to “three days” (P-4).",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by the transcript citations used. The only mild overstatement is presenting loss of taste as an observed fact rather than the mother’s suspicion; however, it remains closely grounded in P-17 and not an added fabricated symptom. No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by laying out a day-by-day timeline from Wednesday evening through Friday, specifying cough onset, worsening trajectory, and timing of fever and additional symptoms. No meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "The generated answer is largely accurate, well-grounded, and focused, but misses a few timeline details from the Gold Answer (runny nose, explicit 3-days correction, and Friday fatigue emphasis) and slightly overstates the taste-change symptom."
