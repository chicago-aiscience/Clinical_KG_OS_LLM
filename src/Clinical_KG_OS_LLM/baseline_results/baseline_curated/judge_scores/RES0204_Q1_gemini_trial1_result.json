  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the content of the transcript. It explicitly states that the transcript does not provide information on whether the cough is productive or the appearance of the nasal discharge. However, the transcript clearly records the patient confirming a 'dry cough' [P-5] with no 'gunk' [P-6] and describing the nasal discharge as 'pretty clear' [P-12].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete as it misses the specific details requested in the prompt (nature of cough and appearance of discharge). It also fails to mention pertinent negatives and the patient's comparison to previous illnesses, which were included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a 'hallucination of absence' by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is present. This is a failure to ground the response in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer identifies the symptoms but fails to address the specific sub-questions regarding the characteristics of those symptoms, providing incorrect excuses instead of the requested data."
