    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points. It misses a few minor details present in the Gold Answer: the assessment for other bites on the patient and her husband, the patient's general statement of 'feeling well otherwise,' and the doctor's plan to consult a supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited. There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the prompt (clinical features assessed/absent and proposed diagnostic tests)."
