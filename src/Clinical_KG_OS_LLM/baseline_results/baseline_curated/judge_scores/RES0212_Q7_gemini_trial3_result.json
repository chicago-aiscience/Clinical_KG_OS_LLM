  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer regarding all specific durations (3 months for onset, 1 month for sleep disruption, 3 days for sputum, and 'past couple of days' for fevers). All clinical facts align with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the requested milestones in the timeline. However, it misses a few specific details included in the Gold Answer, such as the initial onset occurring during a pole dancing class and the characterization of the cough as 'dry and intermittent' during the first two months.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript. However, it hallucinates a source by mentioning a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the provided context. The clinical information itself is faithful to the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested chronological structure to trace the cough's progression."
