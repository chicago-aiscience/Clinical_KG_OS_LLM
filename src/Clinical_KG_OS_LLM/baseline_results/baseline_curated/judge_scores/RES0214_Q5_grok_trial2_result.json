  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core epidemiological factors from the Gold Answer: husband's week-long illness influencing prioritization of COVID-19 (citing P-19 and D-53 correctly, matching Gold's P-19/P-20 and D-51/D-53), limited household transmission implication, and lack of flu shot keeping influenza possible (D-53/P-53). However, it introduces minor discrepancies by emphasizing symptom overlap and adding unsubstantiated 'Knowledge Graph' elements not in Gold or transcript, though these do not contradict the main facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: husband's similar symptoms for past week and doctor's acknowledgment prioritizing COVID (fully covered); no flu shot and doctor's consideration of influenza (fully covered). Key points missed or partially covered: detailed limited outside contact (works from home P-23/P-42, staying home P-22, hiking P-18, no other sick contacts P-17) supporting household transmission—mentioned as 'household transmission' but without specifics or citations, reducing coverage to ~70%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about husband sick contact, doctor's prioritization of COVID, flu shot question, and isolation are verifiable in transcript (P-19, D-53, D-54). However, multiple hallucinations include 'Knowledge Graph' links, '[KG]' references for symptoms and infectiousness, and implication of patient spreading to husband (husband sick first); symptom overlap is plausible but cited to non-existent KG, indicating multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses how epi factors (husband's illness, implied household, no flu shot) shape COVID vs. flu differential, with a focused breakdown prioritizing COVID and keeping flu secondary. Minor tangents on symptom overlap and isolation are somewhat off-topic from strict epi focus but do not derail the core response."
