  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and the negative test result, matching the Gold Answer. It accurately notes the patient's hospital worker status, persistent cough, initial flu-like symptoms resolving, and coworker fear as prompting factors, all grounded in the transcript. Minor discrepancy: states the cough 'worsened into a dry cough,' but transcript indicates it transitioned from productive to dry with stable intensity (P-7), not explicitly worsened—core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: COVID-19 diagnosis (✓), patient disclosure of test (✓), hospital worker (✓, partial cites), flu-like symptoms (✓, via P-14), persistent cough (✓), coworkers scared (✓), negative result (✓). Missed/partial: specific symptoms like sore throat/runny nose listed separately (P-13), PPE use despite care (P-17), test timing at symptom onset two weeks ago (P-36), staying home post-test (P-36). Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript: hospital worker (P-17, P-34), cough duration/persistence (P-2, P-35), dry cough (P-5, P-6), flu-like initial (P-14), coworkers scared (P-35), negative COVID test (P-35). Citations accurate. 'Worsened' is a minor interpretive stretch (transition to dry, but intensity stable P-7), but plausible and not hallucinatory.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses all question parts: specifies COVID-19 investigation, lists prompting evidence (hospital work, cough persistence, symptoms, coworker fear), and test result (negative)—no off-topic content, perfectly focused."
