    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main elements the clinician used: exertional/diffuse chest tightness with some breathlessness, a known history of asthma, de-emphasis of cardiac ischemia due to lack of pain/typical cardiac features, and the proposed trial of a rescue bronchodilator to support the diagnosis. However, it contains notable inaccuracies/overstatements: (1) it implies the patient currently uses/has a rescue puffer, whereas the patient explicitly said he has not refilled the PRN inhaler and doesn’t have it available (P-17–P-18); (2) it suggests the doctor ‘ruled out’ cardiac ischemia, while the transcript states it was lowered on the differential, not excluded (D-36); (3) it states the doctor noted a maintenance inhaler in D-35, which is not said there. These errors reduce factual accuracy, though the core diagnostic reasoning remains aligned with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: asthma history; symptoms of chest tightness/difficulty taking a full breath and exertional worsening; absence of chest pain/cardiac red flags lowering ischemia; therapeutic trial with rescue puffer. Key points missed or insufficiently addressed: the clinician’s explicit linkage to suboptimal asthma regimen (skipping evening controller dose and not refilling rescue inhaler) as summarized in D-34/P-19/P-17–P-18; lack of new environmental exposures/triggers (P-33); the patient’s statement that it feels different but could be asthma-related (P-16); and the broader absence of systemic/infectious symptoms that also supports a noninfectious respiratory etiology. Overall coverage is partial rather than complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to ‘knowledge graph information’ and ‘knowledge graph classification’ are external; claiming the patient has/uses a rescue puffer currently contradicts the transcript; and attributing mention of a maintenance inhaler to D-35 is unsupported. Most other claims (tightness, difficulty taking a full breath, no pain, lower cardiac concern, plan for rescue puffer trial) are supported. Because there are multiple ungrounded/contradictory elements, faithfulness is moderate.",
    "relevance": "The answer largely stays focused on the requested synthesis (symptoms + asthma history + clinical reasoning linking to asthma exacerbation). The added ‘knowledge graph’ framing is tangential and not needed for the question, but it does not overwhelm the response."

  "summary": "Captures the main asthma-vs-cardiac reasoning and bronchodilator trial, but misses several key supporting links (medication underuse, no new exposures, patient’s own framing) and includes multiple ungrounded or transcript-inconsistent claims (especially about rescue inhaler availability and ‘knowledge graph’ references)."
