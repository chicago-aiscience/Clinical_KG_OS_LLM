  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the points it includes. It correctly identifies the two-week duration, the initial flu-like symptoms, the 4-5 day duration of mucus production, its 'whitish clear' appearance, and the transition to a dry cough. It also correctly notes the resulting chest soreness.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details found in the gold answer and requested by the prompt. Specifically, it fails to address the prompt's requirement to describe how the cough's 'intensity and frequency changed over time' (which remained stable/the same). It also omits the specific names of the flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose), the absence of fever, and the negative COVID test result.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. Every claim made is verifiable through the provided patient statements, and there are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant as it follows the requested timeline format. However, it completely ignores one specific instruction within the prompt: to describe changes in intensity and frequency over time."
