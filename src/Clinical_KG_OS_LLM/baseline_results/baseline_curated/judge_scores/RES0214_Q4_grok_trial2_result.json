  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53], matching the Gold Answer. For rationale, it accurately captures the sick contact (husband [P-19]) and key quote from [D-53], which is central to Gold's emphasis on epidemiological context and household transmission. It includes symptoms (fever, sore throat [P-1]) as part of prioritization, which aligns with the doctor's mention of presentation prompting infectious rule-out [D-53], with no contradictions. Minor difference in emphasis (symptoms vs. pure epi), but all facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) Test (swab [D-53]) - covered; 2) Household transmission ([P-19], quote [D-53]) - fully covered; 3) Self-isolate instruction [D-53] reflecting urgency - missed; 4) Reinforcing quote [D-54] - missed; 5) Flu as secondary possibility after COVID rule-out, no flu shot [P-53, D-54] - partially implied but not explicitly covered. Covers core test and primary rationale (epi/quote ~80%), misses supporting details on isolate and flu contrast.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: test/quote [D-53]; symptoms [P-1]; husband [P-19]; general protocol [D-53] ('rule out anything infectious'). Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to question with sections on test and rationale for prioritizing over influenza, using transcript evidence; no off-topic content."
