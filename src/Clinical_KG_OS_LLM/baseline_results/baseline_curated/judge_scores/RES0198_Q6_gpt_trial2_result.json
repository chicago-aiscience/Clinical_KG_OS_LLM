{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s end-of-visit plan in [D-39]: working diagnosis of a viral infection/common cold; supportive care with hydration and OTC medication like Tylenol Cold; COVID swab performed today with results in ~48 hours; isolate at home and await further public health instructions after results. No statements contradict the Gold Answer. Minor wording differences (e.g., “immediately” vs “today”) are consistent with the transcript’s meaning.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key required elements: diagnosis, both specific supportive care recommendations (hydration; OTC Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (COVID swab today with 48-hour turnaround), and public health guidance (isolate at home, avoid others, follow public health instructions after results). However, it omits one aspect included in the Gold Answer: expectation-setting that symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve and that there is not much beyond supportive care for viral illness.",
    "faithfulness": "All included recommendations and guidance are directly supported by [D-39]. No clear hallucinated tests, treatments, or counseling beyond what appears in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by summarizing the end-of-visit management plan with diagnosis, supportive care, ordered test, and public health advice, without tangential content."
