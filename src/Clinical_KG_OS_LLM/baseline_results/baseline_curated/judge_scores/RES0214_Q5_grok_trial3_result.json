  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer focuses on three epi risks: husband's week-long illness suggesting household transmission (cited P-19/20, D-51/53), limited outside contact (P-17/18/22/23/42 supporting household over independent exposure), and no flu shot (P-53/D-53) keeping flu viable but prioritizing COVID. Generated correctly captures husband as prioritizing COVID (P-19/D-53) and no flu shot keeping flu possible (D-53/54), with doctor's quotes accurate. However, it downplays limited outside contact (only implied via household), adds irrelevant symptom overlap and KG hallucinations not in Gold/transcript, minor discrepancies but core epi facts match.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Husband's prior similar symptoms → household tx → COVID priority (full coverage). 2) Limited contacts (work home, staying home, hiking only, no other sick) → supports household tx (partial/implied in Generated via sick contact, misses specifics P-17/18/22/23/42). 3) No flu shot → flu possible alongside COVID (full coverage). Covers ~85% (strong on 1 and 3, weak on 2 details).",
    "faithfulness": "Verifiable: husband sick [P-19], doctor prioritizes COVID [D-53], flu shot Q [D-53], isolation [D-53/54], symptoms [P-1]. Inaccurate/hallucinated: 'Knowledge Graph' and [KG] references not in transcript; symptom overlap 'both cause fever/sore throat [KG]' plausible but not cited from transcript. Multiple unverifiable additions (KG), but core clinical claims grounded with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses epi factors shaping COVID vs flu differential: husband → COVID priority, no flu shot → flu possible. Minor tangents: symptom overlap (not epi risk per Q), isolation (containment, not shaping differential), KG (irrelevant). Mostly focused on question's specified risks."
