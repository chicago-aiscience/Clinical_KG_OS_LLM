  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies anxiety-related chest pain as the diagnosis, which aligns with the Gold Answer's assessment of 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' However, it contains a factual error in citation [P-20] where it states the patient 'explicitly connects the current sensation to a history of anxiety attacks' - the actual P-20 states palpitations only occur 'if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack' in the past tense, not that current chest pain feels like previous attacks. The core diagnosis is correct but this specific claim misrepresents the source material.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer including: situational triggers (isolation vs. social engagement), resolution with distraction, history of anxiety attacks, current thesis stress, breathing symptoms related to nervousness, and patient's consideration of stress as a cause. However, it omits several important supporting details present in the Gold Answer: the specific 8-year gap since last anxiety treatment [P-21, P-22], the patient's acknowledgment that anxiety 'could maybe return' [P-22], the Masters thesis deadline and time pressure specifics [P-15, P-16], and importantly, the pertinent negatives that rule out cardiac/pulmonary causes (no fevers, no exertional worsening, pain at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety, no asthma). These omissions represent approximately 30-40% of the Gold Answer's supporting evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations for most claims. However, there are concerns: (1) The P-20 citation mischaracterizes the patient's statement about anxiety attacks - she was describing past palpitations during anxiety, not connecting current chest pain to those attacks. (2) The claim about 'hands-on activities' [P-29] is accurate. (3) All other citations appear verifiable. The interpretation of 'psychosomatic response' is a reasonable clinical inference from the evidence, though not explicitly stated in the transcript. Overall, one clear misrepresentation of source material and otherwise faithful content.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about what diagnosis the combined findings point toward and provides specific clinical observations supporting the reasoning. All content is focused on answering the question, with systematic presentation of evidence from the consultation. The structure (diagnosis followed by supporting observations) matches what was requested. No irrelevant tangents are present."

  "summary": "The generated answer correctly identifies anxiety-induced chest pain as the diagnosis and provides relevant supporting evidence from the consultation. However, it contains one factual error in citation [P-20] that mischaracterizes the patient's statement about anxiety attacks. The answer covers approximately 60-70% of the key supporting points from the Gold Answer but omits important details including the 8-year treatment gap, specific thesis deadline pressures, and critical pertinent negatives that rule out organic causes. Despite these limitations, the answer is well-focused, mostly accurate, and directly addresses the question with appropriate clinical reasoning."
