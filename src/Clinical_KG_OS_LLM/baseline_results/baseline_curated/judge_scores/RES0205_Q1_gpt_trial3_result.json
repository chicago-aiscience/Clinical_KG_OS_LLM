  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the main persisting symptom (cough for two weeks, now dry) and that earlier mucus resolved, and it accurately notes chest discomfort/soreness with excessive coughing. It does not introduce clear factual errors compared with the Gold Answer. However, it is imprecise/vague about the specific resolved “flu-like symptoms” (Gold specifies sore throat and runny nose) and omits key qualifiers (e.g., productive cough with whitish/clear mucus for 4–5 days). Inclusion of anxiety/acid reflux as “background conditions” is accurate but not part of the acute two-week illness symptoms asked for.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: persistent 2-week cough; earlier mucus that resolved; current dry cough; chest soreness with coughing.\nKey points missed: sore throat (first 2–3 days) and runny nose (initial days); mucus description (whitish/clear) and duration (first 4–5 days); current cough frequency (3–4 times/hour); spontaneous/no triggers; stable intensity and frequency; clarification that they denied independent chest pain; explicitly denied symptoms (no dyspnea, no fever, no N/V, no abdominal pain). Overall, the answer captures less than half of the Gold Answer’s symptom details.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are grounded in the transcript: persistent cough and dry nature ([P-2], [P-5]); earlier mucus ([P-5]/[P-6]); early “flu symptoms” resolving ([P-14]); chest soreness with coughing ([P-15]/[P-16]); anxiety and reflux ([P-22]). No major hallucinated symptoms are added, though the phrasing ‘flu-like symptoms for the first two to three days’ is a mild generalization of the more specific transcript details.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on symptoms during the illness (resolved vs ongoing), but it adds ‘background conditions’ (anxiety, acid reflux) which are not part of the question asking about the two-week illness symptoms. It also omits several symptom specifics that are directly relevant."
