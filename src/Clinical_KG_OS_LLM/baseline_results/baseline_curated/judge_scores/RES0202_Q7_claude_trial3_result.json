  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three-day timeline and matches the Gold Answer's key facts: dry cough starting Wednesday evening, worsening with fatigue on Thursday, and fever emerging Friday along with decreased appetite and loss of taste. The temperature range (100.1-101°F) is accurately reported. All facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: Wednesday evening cough onset, Thursday worsening with fatigue, Friday fever emergence, decreased appetite, and loss of taste. However, it omits the mild runny nose mentioned on Friday [P-16] and doesn't explicitly note that the child appeared 'fine' initially on Wednesday before symptoms started. It also doesn't include the mother's summary statement from P-12 or the correction from P-4, though these are contextual details rather than core symptom progression.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The progression (Wednesday night dry cough → Thursday worsening with fatigue → Friday fever, decreased appetite, taste loss) is properly grounded in patient statements [P-1, P-2, P-15, P-17]. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's requirements: day-by-day evolution, when cough first appeared, how it changed in severity, and when fever and new symptoms emerged. The response is well-organized chronologically and stays focused on the specific symptom timeline requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a highly accurate and well-structured chronological account of the child's illness progression over three days. It correctly identifies all major symptoms and their timing with proper citations. Minor deductions in completeness for omitting the runny nose detail and some contextual elements, but otherwise excellent quality with no factual errors or hallucinations."
