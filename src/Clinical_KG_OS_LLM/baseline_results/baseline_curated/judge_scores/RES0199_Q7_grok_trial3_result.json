  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the initial symptoms (headache and cough four days ago) matching Gold [P-1]. It accurately notes loss of smell one day ago [P-24]. GI symptoms are correctly timed as 'few days back' per initial patient statement [P-1], though Gold provides more precise details (diarrhea 2 days ago [P-28], vomiting yesterday [P-32]). Headache is described as persistent with location, aligning with Gold [P-3, P-5], but omits severity rating (7/10 [P-8]) and explicit stability ('stayed the same' [P-9]). Cough is dry and present [P-12], but lacks explicit stability ('around the same' [P-11]). No contradictions, but minor omissions of details present in Gold and transcript. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: initial symptoms (headache/cough 4 days ago), anosmia (1 day), headache persistent/location, cough dry. Partially covered: GI timing ('few days back' but misses diarrhea specifically 2 days ago, vomiting yesterday details); headache/cough stability (implied by 'remained' but not explicit 'same severity'). Missed: headache severity 7/10, atypical nature, precise GI frequencies/details, negatives (no fever, no resp worsening). Covers ~60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: initial symptoms [P-1], GI [P-1], anosmia [P-24], headache persistent/location [P-3,P-5], cough dry [P-12]. No unverifiable or hallucinated details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured to directly address the question: timeline of symptom onset (initial, then GI, then anosmia), relative timings, and stability of headache/cough. No off-topic content; perfectly focused on clinical progression."
