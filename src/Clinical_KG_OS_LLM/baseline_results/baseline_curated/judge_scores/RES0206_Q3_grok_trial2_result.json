  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer attributes increased dyspnea, cough frequency, sputum volume, and decreased exercise tolerance specifically to COPD exacerbation, and green-yellow sputum, fever, sinus pressure, headache, and sick contact to infection. Generated correctly identifies most symptoms with accurate citations but misattributes purulent sputum primarily to COPD (Gold links it to infection), adds acute onset as infection-specific (not emphasized in Gold), and includes general medical knowledge like 'COPD does not typically cause fever' which aligns but is not directly from Gold. Core facts consistent with minor categorization discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: doctor's assessment quote, COPD symptoms (dyspnea, cough freq, sputum vol, exercise tol), infection symptoms (sputum color, fever, sinus, HA, contact), distinguishing role of sputum/fever, patient history (P-3), excluded triggers (P-26/38), no exam findings. Generated covers main symptoms for both (worsening/SOB/cough/sputum for COPD; fever/contact/onset for infection), distinguishing explanations for fever/sputum/dyspnea; misses sinus pressure, headache, patient insight (P-3), exclusions, doctor's framing, no findings. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited patient symptoms (fever P-9, contact P-20, worsening/SOB/cough/sputum P-1) verifiable in transcript. However, references to non-existent 'knowledge graph,' sputum 'indicating both per KG,' 'pus-filled component obstructing airways,' 'aligns with incubation,' and 'COPD does not typically cause fever' are not in transcript (general knowledge or hallucinated). Doctor's assessment implied but not quoted. Mostly grounded with some unverifiable/plausible additions.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around symptoms supporting dual diagnoses (sections for each) and distinguishing role of fever/sputum (dedicated subsection), precisely matching question without off-topic content."
