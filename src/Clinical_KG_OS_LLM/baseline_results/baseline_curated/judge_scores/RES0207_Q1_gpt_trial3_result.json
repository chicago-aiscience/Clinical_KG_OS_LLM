  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient’s sudden shortness of breath on waking, dry cough, seizure the prior night with history of epilepsy, and the measured temperature of 37.4. A minor discrepancy is that it does not specify the unit (°C) for 37.4, which is explicit/implicit in the Gold Answer context.",
    "completeness": "It captures the key requested elements: respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, dry cough), neurological symptom (seizure with epilepsy history), and an objective fever measurement (37.4). It omits several details included in the Gold Answer: that the cough also began suddenly that morning, that symptoms started ~3 hours prior, that the temperature was checked that morning (though implied), and that the patient felt fine after the seizure. Pertinent negatives from the Gold Answer are not included, but these were not directly asked for in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are supported by the transcript (SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure and epilepsy [P-8], missed medication possibly contributing [P-9], temperature 37.4 described as mild [P-5]). No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the respiratory and neurological symptoms at presentation and the objective fever measurement, which directly answers the question without tangential content."
