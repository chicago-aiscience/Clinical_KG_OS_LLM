  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All facts align with the Gold Answer and source transcript [D-52]. No factual errors present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key components required by the question: alternative diagnosis (COVID), specific test (COVID swab), and turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, it lacks the additional context provided in the Gold Answer about symptom overlap details (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) and the exact quote about symptoms overlapping. These are supplementary details rather than core answer components, so completeness is high but not perfect.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The doctor explicitly states 'because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid we'll also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that' and 'you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours.' Citations are accurate and appropriate. No hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question without tangential information. The inclusion of citations enhances relevance by grounding the answer in the source material. No irrelevant content present."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate, well-grounded, and highly relevant response to all three components of the question. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, COVID swab as the test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time, with appropriate citations to [D-52]. The only minor limitation is the absence of supplementary contextual details about specific overlapping symptoms that appear in the Gold Answer, preventing a perfect completeness score. Overall, this is an excellent response that fully addresses the clinical question."
