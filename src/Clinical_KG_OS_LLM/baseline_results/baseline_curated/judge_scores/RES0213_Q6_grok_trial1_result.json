  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer correctly identifies the concluding plan from [D-33] as relaying information to another doctor for evaluation, with no investigations or diagnoses stated. The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the concluding remarks and plan are not included, stating the transcript ends at [P-29], despite the full transcript including [D-30] to [D-33] and [P-33]. For key information, the Generated Answer covers some symptom details (sharp pain on deep breath, triggers when alone/studying) and history (father's MI, anxiety, stress, smoking quit attempt), but misses core facts like 1.5-week duration, 20-minute episodes, relief by distraction/not worse with exercise, failed specific OTC meds, multiple pertinent negatives (no trauma, fever, asthma, baseline dyspnea, family sudden death), detailed smoking history (5/day from 10), thesis stress specifics, living alone, multivitamin. It also introduces inaccuracies like 'absent palpitations [KG]' (patient had no flutters except anxiety). Significant contradictions on plan and incomplete/inaccurate key facts warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: plan from [D-33]; symptoms (sharp, 1.5wks, 20min episodes at rest/alone, deep breath worse, not exercise, distraction relieves); failed OTC (Tylenol/Advil/Alka-Seltzer); negatives (no trauma/fevers/asthma/dyspnea/palps/family sudden death/arrhythmias); history (teen anxiety 8yrs ago, smoking 5/day from 10, dad MI 50s); psychosocial (thesis stress, alone, multivitamin). Generated covers ~30%: partial symptoms/triggers, partial family/anxiety/stress/smoking. Misses plan entirely, OTC, most negatives, specifics. Score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites some transcript segments accurately (e.g., [P-3],[P-19],[P-29]), but hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' references throughout (e.g., pain location, heart disease concern, absent palpitations [KG]), not present in transcript. Falsely claims transcript ends at [P-29], ignoring [D-30]-[D-33]. Claims like 'does not have palpitations [KG]' misrepresent [P-20] (no except anxiety). Multiple hallucinations from external 'KG' make it not fully grounded. Score 2.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for stated plan from concluding remarks AND key info gathered. Generated directly denies plan exists/misses it (off-topic error), then partially lists relevant key info in categories addressing symptoms/history/risks/triggers, but KG tangents dilute focus. Partially relevant due to half-coverage and denial of core element. Score 3."
