  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the key elements in the Gold Answer: COVID swab ordered with 24–48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation, possibility of false negatives, alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative, and ER red flags (high temperature, neurologic symptoms such as seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting). One minor inaccuracy/overstatement is the phrasing that fever \"ruled out\" asthma; the transcript/Gold Answer says asthma would be considered if cough/SOB occurred *without* fever, whereas with fever infection is more likely—so asthma is deprioritized rather than strictly ruled out.",
    "completeness": "Covers most Gold Answer key points: test + turnaround, isolation duration, alternative viral illness, false negatives, ER warning signs with examples, and mention of asthma as a conditional alternative consideration. It omits one specific detail from the plan: isolation \"including from his younger sister if possible.\" It also does not explicitly restate \"no medications / watchful waiting,\" though it implies waiting for results; this is a minor omission relative to the question’s requested elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by the transcript citations (especially D-44 and D-45). The only borderline issue is the stronger wording about asthma being ruled out; the transcript supports conditional consideration rather than definitive exclusion. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question components (assessment/plan, diagnostic test and turnaround, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negatives, and ER warning signs with examples). No meaningful irrelevant content."
