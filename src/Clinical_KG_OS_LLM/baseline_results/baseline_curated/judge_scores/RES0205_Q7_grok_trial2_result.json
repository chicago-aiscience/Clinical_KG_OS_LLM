  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts mentioned without contradictions to the Gold Answer or transcript. It correctly states the onset two weeks ago with flu-like symptoms [P-14, P-2], resolution of other symptoms in 3-4 days [P-14], mucus production for 4-5 days described as whitish clear [P-6], transition to dry cough after that [P-5, P-6], persistence of cough [P-2], and chest soreness from coughing [P-15]. It does not include extraneous or incorrect details, but omits some specifics like sore throat timing, no fevers, cough intensity/frequency stability, and COVID test; however, omissions are not factual errors. Core facts are fully consistent. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Onset ~2 weeks ago with flu-like symptoms; 2) First 2-3 days sore throat and runny nose; 3) Sore throat resolved 2-3 days; 4) Other flu symptoms resolved 3-4 days; 5) Productive cough with whitish clear mucus first 4-5 days; 6) Transition to dry cough after day 4-5; 7) Cough intensity same; 8) Frequency stable at 3-4x/hour, spontaneous; 9) No fevers; 10) Only remaining symptom dry cough + chest soreness; 11) COVID negative at onset, home since. Covered: 1,4,5,6,10 (partial). Missed: 2,3,7,8,9,11 (specifics on sore throat, intensity/freq details, no fever, COVID). Covers approximately 50-70% of key points, with good coverage of core timeline but missing several details. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: onset/cough 2 weeks [P-2], flu-like first couple days [P-14], other symptoms resolve 3-4 days [P-14], mucus whitish clear 4-5 days [P-6], transition to dry [P-5, P-6], persistence [P-2], chest soreness when coughing too much [P-15]. No hallucinated facts or unverifiable details; 'majority of time dry' is accurate given timeline. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured as a clear timeline directly addressing the question's elements: initial flu-like onset, mucus duration/look, transition to dry cough, resolution of other symptoms, and cough persistence (implying no major change). Includes relevant chest soreness as current status. No off-topic content, perfectly focused. Score: 5"
