  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Local site symptoms (redness, tenderness, skin soreness behind the knee) are consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. However, the systemic-symptom section contains major factual errors: (1) It treats the patient’s clarification “not the joint itself” [P-1] as the denial of joint pain, but the actual screening question/denial is [D-7]/[P-7] (“Any other joint pain?” “No.”). (2) It mis-cites and misquotes headaches—headache denial occurs at [D-19]/[P-19] (and [P-20]), not [P-6], and the quoted response is not in [P-6]. (3) It incorrectly states there is no explicit denial of fever; the patient clearly denied feeling feverish/ill at [D-8]/[P-8]. These errors contradict both transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers some key local symptoms: redness, tenderness, and localized skin soreness (all in Gold). Misses other Gold local details: the tick was “stuck pretty good,” denial of bullseye/target rash and “larger circle rash,” and the patient stating she was otherwise fine/healthy. For systemic screening, it attempts to cover joint pain, fever, and headaches, but omits/does not mention the ‘feeling ill’ screen explicitly and mishandles fever and joint pain details; overall partial coverage of Gold’s systemic negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: it attributes a headache denial to [P-6] with a quote that does not appear there; it claims no explicit fever denial despite [P-8] clearly denying feverishness/illness; and it reframes [P-1] as denial of joint pain rather than using the actual [P-7] denial. These are multiple transcript-grounding/citation errors.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely focused on what was asked—local bite-site symptoms and systemic symptoms screened/denied (fever, joint pain, headaches)—with minimal extraneous content, though the systemic portion is inaccurate."
