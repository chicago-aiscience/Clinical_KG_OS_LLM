  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims the transcript does not describe the character of the nasal discharge, whereas P-5 explicitly states it is 'mostly clear'. Furthermore, it claims there is no evidence of symptom denials, but the transcript contains explicit denials for cough (P-4), post-nasal drip (P-6), sore throat/fevers (P-7), and loss of taste/smell (P-16).",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide the character of the discharge and the list of denied symptoms, which were specifically requested in the prompt and present in the Gold Answer. It only successfully identifies the reported nasal symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer demonstrates a failure to ground its claims in the provided text. It asserts that information is missing ('The transcript does not contain a description', 'There is no evidence...') when that information is clearly present in the source text.",
    "relevance": "While the answer is structured to address the specific parts of the question, the content provided for two of the three sections is 'information not found,' which is incorrect and therefore fails to properly address the query."
