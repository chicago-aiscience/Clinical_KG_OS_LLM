  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, COVID swab as the test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key components requested in the question: alternative diagnosis (COVID-19), specific test (COVID swab), and turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, it lacks the additional context provided in the Gold Answer about which symptoms overlapped (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) and the rationale for exclusion, making it less comprehensive though still complete for the core question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The doctor explicitly states 'because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid we'll also do a covid swab' and 'you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours.' No hallucinated content present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question with appropriate citations. The response is focused and contains no irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately addresses all three components of the question with correct information drawn from the transcript. It identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, COVID swab as the test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time, with proper citations. While slightly less detailed than the Gold Answer in explaining symptom overlap, it fully answers the core question without errors or hallucinations."
