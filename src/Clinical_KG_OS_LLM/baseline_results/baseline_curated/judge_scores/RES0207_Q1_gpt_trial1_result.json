  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the key respiratory symptoms (sudden shortness of breath on waking and dry cough) and the neurological symptom (seizure the prior night with known epilepsy), consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. It also accurately reports the patient’s objective temperature value (37.4) described as mild. Minor issues: it does not specify the timing details emphasized in the Gold Answer (e.g., symptoms starting ~3 hours prior; cough started suddenly that morning) and does not explicitly state the unit as degrees Celsius (though this is implied by the Gold Answer). No contradictory or clearly false statements are present.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core required elements: SOB, dry cough, seizure/epilepsy, and objective fever measurement (37.4). It omits some Gold Answer details: (1) onset estimate (~3 hours before) and explicit statement that cough began suddenly that morning, (2) explicit ‘no sputum production’ phrasing (only ‘dry cough’), and (3) that the patient felt fine after the seizure and went to bed, and (4) additional pertinent negatives listed in the Gold Answer (not strictly required by the question). Overall, it captures most key points but not all details included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript: SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure last night and epilepsy [P-8], possible missed medication contribution [P-9], and temperature 37.4 described as mild [P-5]. No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing respiratory symptoms, neurological symptom(s), and the objective fever measurement. No notable irrelevant tangents."
