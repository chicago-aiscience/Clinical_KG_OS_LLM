  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all queried elements: (1) condition to rule out = COVID-19; (2) test ordered = a swab for COVID; (3) turnaround time = 24–48 hours; (4) if negative, alternative diagnosis = another viral illness. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present. The added mention of symptoms being 'medically linked' via a 'knowledge graph' does not contradict the Gold Answer, though it is not part of the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The question asks specifically for: primary condition to rule out, the diagnostic test and turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis if negative. The Generated Answer includes all of these. (Gold Answer also mentions isolation for 14 days and contact tracing if positive, but those are not required by the question as posed.)",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims (COVID-19, swab, 24–48 hours, alternative viral illness) are directly supported by D-52. However, references to a 'knowledge graph' and a KG citation (e.g., hydration linkage) are not present in the transcript and therefore are not verifiable from the provided source. This constitutes minor ungrounded embellishment, though it does not materially change the clinical answer.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the exact items requested. The only minor tangent is the 'knowledge graph' rationale and hydration example, which are not necessary to answer the question but do not substantially distract from it."
