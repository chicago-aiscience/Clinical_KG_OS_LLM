  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies the diagnosis as a 'respiratory infection,' which is accurate but less specific than the Gold Answer's 'acute lower respiratory tract infection' or 'acute bronchitis.' It correctly identifies the three clinical features. However, it attributes its reasoning to a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the provided source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific differential of acute bronchitis vs. pneumonia. 2) The significance of the acute worsening superimposed on a 3-month chronic cough. 3) The clinical explanation of *how* these features contribute (e.g., transition from irritation to inflammation, systemic inflammatory response). 4) The importance of the absence of other symptoms (night sweats, weight loss) mentioned in the doctor's summary.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer repeatedly cites a 'Knowledge Graph' as the source for clinical associations (e.g., 'The Knowledge Graph explicitly states...'). This is a hallucination of the source material, as the provided context is strictly a transcript. It does, however, correctly cite the transcript [P-2, P-4, P-9, D-47] for the patient's symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by naming a diagnosis and explaining how each of the three requested features contributes to that diagnosis."
