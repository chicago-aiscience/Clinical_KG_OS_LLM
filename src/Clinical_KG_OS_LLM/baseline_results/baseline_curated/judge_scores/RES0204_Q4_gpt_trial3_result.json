  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies **asthma** as the respiratory condition considered and ruled out, and it correctly lists the key maternal “pertinent negatives”: **no shortness of breath** and **no wheezing**, including **even with physical activity** (matches [P-28]). However, it inaccurately states the family history was “reported by the patient” and cites **[P-13]**, which in the transcript is about fever/chills, not family history. It also fails to specify that the family history was in the **grandparents** (as in the question/gold).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements: (1) asthma ruled out; (2) family history in grandparents; (3) patient already “worked up” for asthma; (4) no SOB; (5) no wheeze; (6) negatives persist even with physical activity; (7) mother’s conclusion he doesn’t have asthma; (8) (optional/supporting) patient otherwise healthy/never had similar cough. Generated Answer includes (1), (3), (4), (5), (6). It omits (2) grandparents detail and does not include the mother’s explicit concluding phrasing or the extra contextual point about being otherwise healthy/never having this cough. Overall ~5/6 of the core items asked in the question, but misses the “grandparents” aspect.",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is grounded in [P-28] (worked up for asthma; no SOB/wheeze even with activity). However, the statement that the positive family history was reported by the patient with citation **[P-13]** is not supported by the transcript and is a clear citation/attribution error. This reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses what condition was ruled out and which absent symptoms (including with exercise) were cited to rule it out. No meaningful tangents."
