  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three triggers (exercise during gym/recess, cold air/winter, spring/pollen) and links them to worsening asthma symptoms, consistent with P-9 and P-11. It also correctly notes family history via the sister having asthma (P-32). However, it introduces non-transcript language (“knowledge graph explicitly links…”) and implies structured evidence not present in the transcript. These are minor inaccuracies/unverifiable framings rather than direct clinical contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: all three triggers; that pollen/spring suggests an allergic component; sister with asthma; current symptoms consistent with exacerbation.\nKey points missed from the Gold Answer: (1) explicit statement that the patient reported no other triggers (D-10/P-10); (2) that the clinician asked about allergies and the patient suspected allergies but was never formally diagnosed (D-12/P-12) and clinician said “that would make sense” (D-13); (3) the magnitude of escalation in rescue inhaler use from ~once every 2 weeks to ~5–6 times/week (P-8); (4) that no other family members had breathing problems or known allergies (P-33/P-34); (5) clinician’s suggestion that a medication change is needed because rescue-only therapy is insufficient (D-43). Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript (symptoms, triggers, increased bronchodilator use in general, sister with asthma). The repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and claims that it “explicitly links” pollen to allergies are not in the transcript and therefore are ungrounded. Aside from that framing, there are no major fabricated clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on how the three triggers and sister’s asthma relate to the current exacerbation and why pollen exposure raises suspicion for undiagnosed allergies. It directly answers the question with minimal tangential content."
