  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer’s core facts: the clinician felt symptoms were consistent with COVID-19, planned a COVID swab and chest X-ray, instructed isolation until results, and noted isolation may need to continue despite a negative result if symptoms persist. No contradictions or added incorrect details are present.",
    "completeness": "It covers the main required elements from the Gold Answer (assessment + both diagnostic tests + isolation until results + continued isolation if still symptomatic after a negative result). It does not include two secondary points mentioned in the Gold Answer: (1) that the clinician would consult with the supervising doctor and return to discuss next steps, and (2) that the patient acknowledged/agreed with the plan. Overall coverage is high but not 100%.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, particularly [D-43]. It does not introduce new, unverifiable clinical rationales (e.g., linking to COPD), so there is no notable hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question: overall assessment, specific tests, isolation instructions, and the condition for continued isolation after results."
