  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly explains the time-based reasoning: the patient was outdoors Friday hiking and Saturday gardening, then found/removed the tick “earlier today,” and the doctor inferred this could imply >72 hours since potential exposure (consistent with [P-1], [D-1], [D-2], [D-6]). However, it is factually incorrect in the second part: the transcript explicitly contains the Ontario Lyme distribution map discussion and the doctor’s conclusion that “Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point,” supporting antibiotics ([D-13]). The Generated Answer directly contradicts this by claiming that detail is not present and that justification relied “solely” on duration and prior rash history.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer: (1) patient unsure when tick attached; hiking Friday + gardening Saturday; discovered/removed earlier today; doctor infers >72 hours and recommends prophylaxis; (2) Strathroy location along the creek; doctor checks Ontario Lyme distribution map; Strathroy deemed concerning enough; therefore proceed with antibiotics. The Generated Answer covers (1) reasonably well but largely omits/misrepresents (2) by denying the map-based justification entirely. Thus, it includes only about half of the required elements and misses a major component of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Most of the first paragraph is grounded in the transcript and cites [P-1] and [D-6] appropriately. But the claim that the map-based detail is “not present” is unfaithful to the transcript, since [D-13] explicitly mentions the Ontario Lyme distribution map and Strathroy being concerning. It also adds an interpretation (“typical window for bacterial transmission to be prevented”) that is not explicitly stated in the transcript, though it is a plausible clinical rationale.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address both parts of the question (duration estimate and geographic justification). However, the second part is not only incorrect but directly conflicts with what was asked and what the transcript shows, reducing its usefulness while remaining on-topic overall."
