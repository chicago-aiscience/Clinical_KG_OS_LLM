  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer factually in all aspects: diagnosis as 'viral infection like/specificially the common cold', supportive care (hydration and OTC like Tylenol Cold), diagnostic swab today with 48-hour results, public health isolation and further instructions. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'specifically the common cold', 'immediately to rule out COVID-19') are consistent with transcript and Gold; no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnosis (100%), supportive care recs (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold - 100%), diagnostic test details (swab today/immediately, 48 hours - 100%), public health (isolate home/not see others, further public health instructions - 100%). Partially covers expectation setting ('few weeks to resolve', 'not much beyond supportive care') implicitly but not explicitly listed, estimating 90% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-39]: diagnosis phrasing, hydration, OTC 'Tylenol cold', pandemic context/swab today/48 hours, isolation/not see anyone, public health instructions. Citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response into exact categories requested (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance); no off-topic content or tangents."
