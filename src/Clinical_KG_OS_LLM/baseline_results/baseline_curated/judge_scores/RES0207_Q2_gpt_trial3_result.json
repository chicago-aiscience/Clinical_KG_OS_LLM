  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s prescribed medication for epilepsy (matches Gold: Keppra). For the missed dose, it states the patient “forgot,” which is true but omits the specific situational trigger (daughter’s birthday/changed routine). It does not introduce an explicitly wrong circumstance, but it is less precise than the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) Keppra for epilepsy; (2) the patient forgot a dose. Misses key Gold details: the missed dose occurred because it was the daughter’s birthday celebration, their routine changed, and the patient usually takes it with dinner but didn’t have dinner at the usual time; also misses that it was an isolated lapse rather than a persistent adherence issue and the patient linking the missed dose to the seizure. Overall ~50–79% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Keppra and forgetting are grounded in the transcript (P-23, P-9). However, the answer references a “knowledge graph link” and that a “knowledge graph supports as a cause for seizures,” which are not present in the provided transcript—these are unverifiable additions. This reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (medication + why a dose was missed). The extra ‘knowledge graph’ commentary is not needed but does not substantially derail the response."
