    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold states onset 3 days ago on walk with dog, no specific trigger, staying the same/steady, always there but worse on walks/getting up/big breath, inspiration, reduced walks from 2 to 1/day, no work miss. Generated correctly notes 3 days, tightness on inspiration/not pain, walking trigger. However, implies evolution/worsening ('evolved into significant respiratory issue') contradicting 'staying the same'; misses first on dog walk specifically; partial exacerbators (only walking); adds hoarse/phlegm not central to tightness evolution; misses precise walk reduction and no work impact. Some factual errors/omissions, main points partially correct. Score: 3",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: 3-day onset (covered), first on dog walk (partial, walking but no dog), no trigger (missed), staying same (missed), exacerbators walks/chair/breath (only walks covered), inspiration (covered), 2-to-1 walks (missed), no work miss (missed), limiting activity (partial). Covers onset, partial trigger/exacerbator/impact, description (~50-60%). Score: 3",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: 3 days [P-1], inspiration [P-1/5], walking [P-1/4/9], breathlessness [P-1/7], hoarse [P-11]. Citations accurate. Minor issues: 'evolved into significant respiratory issue' interpretive/not verbatim (steady per [P-2/3]); hoarse as 'evolution' stretch. Doctor plan [D-35] tangential but grounded. Mostly grounded. Score: 4",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses onset, trigger, description, impact on walks; structured per question elements. Minor additions (asthma diff, hoarse) slightly tangential but on-topic. No off-topic content. Score: 4"
