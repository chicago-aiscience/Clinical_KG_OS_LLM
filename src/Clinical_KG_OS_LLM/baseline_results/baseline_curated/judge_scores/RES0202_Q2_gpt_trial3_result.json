  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly states the doctor recommended a COVID-19 swab with results in 24–48 hours, advised 14 days of isolation, and specifically mentioned isolating from the younger sister. These points match the Gold Answer and are supported by the transcript (D-44). No incorrect statements are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the generated answer includes: (1) COVID swab with 24–48 hour turnaround, (2) isolate for 14 days, and (3) isolate from younger sister. It omits several other management measures present in the Gold Answer: ER/return precautions (high fever, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, fainting), discussion of possible false-negative and alternative viral illness, supportive/observational approach with waiting for results/no medications, and the school’s requirement for a test to return. Overall coverage is under half of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly grounded in the transcript (D-44). No hallucinated tests, treatments, or timelines are added.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question’s requested elements (diagnostic test, isolation instructions/duration, and who to isolate from) without tangents."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded for the asked isolation/testing details, but incomplete relative to the Gold Answer because it omits the doctor’s return-to-ER precautions and other counseling points."
