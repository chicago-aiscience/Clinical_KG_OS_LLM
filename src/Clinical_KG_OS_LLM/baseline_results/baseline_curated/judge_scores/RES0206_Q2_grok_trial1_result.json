  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer regarding the two inhalers (daily maintenance and rescue used once every two weeks), no antihypertensive medications, and the reason (lifestyle modifications first with current BP OK). Minor discrepancies include incorrect citation of [P-1] for inhaler types (details are in [P-26]), addition of 'dietary adjustments' not explicitly in Gold or transcript (lifestyle is vague), and interpretive 'walking dogs with friends' (from exposure context, not precise mgmt). No major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: COPD inhalers and frequencies (100%), no antiHTN meds, reason (lifestyle first incl. walking/weight loss), BP OK. Missed: no home oxygen [P-1], doctor support for lifestyle [D-25], quit smoking [P-40], rare alcohol [P-39], baseline COPD well-managed [P-28], exacerbations when sick [P-27], no allergies [P-29/30]. Covers ~70% of Gold points, focusing on core question but omitting supportive details.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: inhaler details [P-26], no meds/reason [P-23], BP OK [P-23], exacerbation [P-1]. Minor issues: [P-1] citation inaccurate for inhalers; 'dietary adjustments' not in transcript (hallucinated); 'walking dogs with friends outside' interpretive from [P-20]/[P-24] but not exact mgmt strategy. No multiple fabrications, largely grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around COPD meds/frequencies, HTN strategies/no meds, and explicit reason for no antiHTN; minor context on exacerbation is directly relevant to current status."
