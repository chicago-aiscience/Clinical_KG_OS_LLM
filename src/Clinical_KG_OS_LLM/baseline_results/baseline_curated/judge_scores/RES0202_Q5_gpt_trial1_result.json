  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that school attendance was considered the likely place of acquisition (mother suspected COVID from school) and aligns symptom onset with returning from school Wednesday. It accurately reports no known sick contacts outside of school, uncertainty about exposures at school, and that the school had not contacted the family about exposures. A minor inaccuracy/overreach is attributing the motivation/wording “make sure he either has it or doesn’t” to the mother’s reason for presentation; that phrasing comes from the clinician’s plan [D-44], while the mother’s school-related reason was the need for a COVID test to return to school [P-41].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points relevant to the question are covered: (1) school as suspected source; (2) onset after returning from school Wednesday; (3) no known sick contacts outside school; (4) uncertainty about school contacts; (5) no school notification of exposures. The Generated Answer does not include the Gold Answer’s additional detail that the school required a COVID test for return and to enable exposure notifications to other families [P-41], but this is ancillary to the specific question asked and does not substantially reduce coverage of the asked elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by transcript quotes [P-1, P-2, P-38, P-39]. Minor unfaithfulness includes referencing a “knowledge graph” (not present in transcript) and using clinician wording from [D-44] to characterize the mother’s intent without clarifying it was the doctor’s statement. No major hallucinated clinical events or exposures.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on how school attendance related to suspected source and what was reported about sick contacts at school vs outside school, including school notification status. No meaningful tangents."
