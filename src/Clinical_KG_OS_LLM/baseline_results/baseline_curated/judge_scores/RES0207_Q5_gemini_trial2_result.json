  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two primary risk factors: the missed dose of Keppra and the hereditary predisposition via the mother. These align perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses some contextual details found in the Gold Answer, such as the specific reason for the missed dose (the daughter's birthday celebration) and the fact that the patient's seizures are typically infrequent, which underscores the impact of the missed medication.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful to the transcript but includes hallucinations regarding the source of its logic, twice referencing a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the provided context or transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and clearly addresses both parts of the prompt regarding the risk factors and the specific relation of family history to the diagnosis."
