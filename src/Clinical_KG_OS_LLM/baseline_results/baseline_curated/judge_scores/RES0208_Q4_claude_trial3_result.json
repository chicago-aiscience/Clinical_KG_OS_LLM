    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that sore throat and cough were 'negated/denied' when the patient actually confirmed both symptoms (P-9: 'I think so' for sore throat, P-8: 'maybe could be starting one' for cough). The Gold Answer correctly identifies the symptoms that were explicitly denied: runny nose, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and numbness/tingling. The Generated Answer also incorrectly claims loss of smell was absent when P-6 confirms it ('yeah, kind of'). The analysis of chest pain's role in differentiation is correct but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It only mentions one of the eight explicitly denied symptoms (chest pain) and incorrectly treats two confirmed symptoms as denied. It completely misses: runny nose/congestion, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and numbness/tingling. The differential diagnosis discussion is superficial compared to the Gold Answer's comprehensive explanation of how each pertinent negative helps rule out specific conditions (cardiac, GI, neurological, common cold).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains multiple claims contradicted by the transcript. It states sore throat and cough were denied when P-8 and P-9 show they were confirmed. It claims anosmia was absent when P-6 confirms it. The claim that 'the knowledge graph indicates loss of smell is specific to COVID-19' references information not present in the provided transcript. These are hallucinations or misinterpretations of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address both parts of the question (which symptoms were denied and how they help differentiation) but does so inaccurately. The discussion of differential diagnosis is somewhat relevant but based on incorrect symptom identification. About 40% of the content is on-topic but undermined by factual errors."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant problems with factual accuracy, incorrectly identifying which symptoms were denied versus confirmed. It misses 7 of 8 pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer and misrepresents information from the transcript regarding sore throat, cough, and loss of smell. While it attempts to discuss differential diagnosis, the analysis is incomplete and built on faulty symptom identification. The answer shows some understanding of clinical reasoning but fails to accurately extract and analyze the specific information requested from the transcript."
