{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with both the transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the COVID swab, the 14-day isolation duration, and the instruction to isolate from the younger sister.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the specific items explicitly listed in the question (test, isolation duration, household contact). however, it misses several 'management measures' included in the Gold Answer, such as the ER return-to-care precautions (high temperature, neurological symptoms, etc.), the discussion of false-negative possibilities, and the supportive care/observational approach ('wait for results'). These represent about 40-50% of the management plan described by the doctor.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript. The details about the COVID swab, the 14-day period, and the sister are all directly from [D-44].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and focuses exactly on the components requested by the question."
