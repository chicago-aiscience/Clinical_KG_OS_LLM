  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by introducing a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the provided materials. The transcript does not contain any knowledge graph, and the Generated Answer fabricates this as a source. However, the core facts about Jessica's symptoms (dry cough, fever, scratchy throat, headache) and the absence of symptoms (sputum, GI symptoms, joint pain) are correctly identified from the transcript. The interpretation of how these symptoms support URI diagnosis is generally sound, despite the fabricated knowledge graph reference.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: dry cough [P-1, P-4], subjective fever [P-7, P-9], scratchy throat [P-1, P-4], headache [P-1, P-2], absence of sputum [P-5, P-6], absence of GI symptoms [P-11, P-12], and absence of joint pain [P-13]. However, it misses several important details: the 3-4 day timeline [P-1, P-3], general malaise [P-14], fatigue [P-13], the brother's recent cold [P-39] providing viral exposure context, and the doctor's summary [D-58]. Coverage is approximately 70-75% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer has a major faithfulness violation by fabricating a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the transcript. This is a clear hallucination. The answer incorrectly states 'The provided knowledge graph explicitly defines...' when no such knowledge graph was provided. Additionally, the citation [D-58] is misused - the doctor's statement 'You have been bringing anything up' actually appears at [D-5], not [D-58]. At [D-58], the doctor provides a summary. Despite these hallucinations, most other symptom citations are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses how Jessica's symptoms support the URI diagnosis, which is precisely what the question asks. The structure organizing symptoms into 'Alignment,' 'Corroboration,' and 'Ruling Out Differentials' is logical and relevant. However, the fabricated knowledge graph discussion detracts from relevance as it introduces non-existent material. The core content about symptom presentation and differential diagnosis is highly relevant to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Jessica's key symptoms and their role in supporting URI diagnosis, but contains a critical fabrication (non-existent knowledge graph) that significantly undermines its faithfulness and correctness. It misses important contextual details like the timeline, malaise, fatigue, and viral exposure history. While the clinical reasoning about symptom patterns is sound, the hallucinated content and incomplete coverage of key points from the Gold Answer result in a below-average evaluation."
