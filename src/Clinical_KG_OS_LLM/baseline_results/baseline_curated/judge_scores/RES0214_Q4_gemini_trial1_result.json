  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the covid swab as the diagnostic test and correctly identifies the primary rationale given by the doctor (household transmission/husband's symptoms). All statements are consistent with the transcript and the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the core facts: the test and the husband's sickness as the main rationale. However, it misses a few secondary points mentioned in the gold answer, specifically the instruction to self-isolate as a reflection of urgency/containment and the fact that influenza was only discussed after the covid rule-out plan and the inquiry about the flu shot.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is strictly grounded in the transcript. It uses correct citations [D-53, P-1, P-19] and does not hallucinate information outside the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question (the test and the rationale) without any off-topic information."
