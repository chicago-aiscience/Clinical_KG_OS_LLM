  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies and lists the four reported symptoms (fever, sore throat, stuffy nose, muscle ache) matching the Gold Answer's facts and providing accurate citations from the transcript. However, it contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript does not contain explicit denials of cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and the actual transcript (e.g., P-10 for cough, P-8 for headache, P-7 for neck stiffness, P-5 for nausea/vomiting, P-24-P-26 for difficulty swallowing). This significant contradiction on the second core part of the question results in a score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) stuffy nose [P-1, etc.], (2) sore throat [P-1], (3) fever [P-1], (4) muscle aches [P-13-P-16]; denials of cough [P-10], headache [P-8], neck stiffness [P-7], nausea/vomiting [P-5], difficulty swallowing [P-24-P-26]. Generated covers all four symptoms accurately (~100% of that part) but completely misses all five specified denials, instead incorrectly stating they are unverifiable. Covers roughly 40-50% of Gold's key points (symptoms only), scoring 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom claims are fully verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (P-1, P-13). However, the claim that 'transcript segments do not contain... denials' is false and hallucinates their absence despite clear evidence (P-5, P-7, P-8, P-10, P-24-P-26). Additionally, it hallucinates a doctor inquiry about 'ear pain' (not present in transcript) and incorrectly limits responses to P-1/P-13, ignoring others. Multiple hallucinated facts result in a score of 2.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured to directly address the question's two parts (reported symptoms and specific denials), with no off-topic content, tangents, or extraneous information, scoring 5."
