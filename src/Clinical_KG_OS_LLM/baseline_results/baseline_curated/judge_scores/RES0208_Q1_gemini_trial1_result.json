  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several inaccuracies: 1) It categorizes 'Headaches' as a 'Sensory Change', which is atypical; 2) It misinterprets the patient's description of a cough ('it feels dry like it's on its way') as a 'Dry Throat Sensation'; 3) It fails to mention the most distinct sensory symptoms (loss of taste and smell) and the primary constitutional finding (subjective fever) mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. It misses several key symptoms present in the gold answer: loss of taste, loss of smell, subjective fever, and the specific mention of a sore throat. It also omits the detail that the patient's wife confirmed he felt warm.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript, but the interpretation of P-8's 'dry' comment as a 'dry throat' is a misattribution, as the context clearly refers to a dry cough. Otherwise, the references to aches, weakness, and appetite are faithful to the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant in that it attempts to categorize symptoms according to the prompt's requirements, but it misses the most relevant clinical data points (taste/smell/fever)."
