  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three risk factors and provides some accurate details from the transcript (e.g., pack a day [P-37], consultant in Sarnia [P-33], grandpa lung cancer [P-42]). However, it omits key details like smoking started at age 15 [P-38] and occupational mitigating factors (safety measures, engineering side not direct plant work [P-34]). Clinical relations have discrepancies: emphasizes acute irritation and pleuritic pain without mentioning hemoptysis [P-4,P-6], mucociliary impairment, pneumonia/COPD risks, or conditional vigilance for malignancy; instead suggests immediate high-risk for serious pathology. Includes irrelevant cannabis [P-40] under smoking. Some factual errors/omissions but main points of risk factors and relations mostly aligned with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: smoking pack/day and family history fully; partial for smoking start age (missed), occupational details (misses [P-34]), explanations (misses mucociliary clearance, pneumonia/COPD/malignancy ties to hemoptysis, mitigation). Covers hemoptysis indirectly via symptoms but not explicitly; misses acute infection primary with vigilance if persists. Collective relation partially covered in summary. Approximately 60-70% coverage (three factors structured, details ~70%, explanations ~50%).",
    "faithfulness": "All cited transcript references accurate and verifiable (e.g., [P-37], [P-33], [P-42], symptoms [P-1,15,17,18]). Patient presentation details (cough, sore throat, pleuritic pain) grounded in transcript. Clinical interpretations (e.g., smoking causes mucosal damage, chemical exposure aggravates pleuritis) plausible but not directly stated in transcript—no hallucinations or fabrications, minor interpretive additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three exact risk factors from question, elicits specific details with citations, explains relations to presentation (cough, pain, etc.), and summarizes collective impact—perfectly focused with no off-topic content."
