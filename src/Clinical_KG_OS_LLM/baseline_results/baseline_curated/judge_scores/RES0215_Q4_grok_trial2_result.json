    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor does not explicitly ask about fever [D-7/P-7], runny nose [D-8/P-8], sick contacts [D-10/P-10], recent travel [D-11/P-11], rashes [D-13/P-13], or phlegm production [D-31/P-31], which directly contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer; it fabricates a focus on asthma and viral bronchitis without addressing the specific screening questions, leading to complete factual inaccuracy compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers key screenings (fever for pneumonia/bronchitis, runny nose for URTI, sick contacts for contagious infections, travel for exposures, rashes for allergic/viral, phlegm for productive cough, plus pain and other negatives narrowing to reactive airway); Generated covers 0% of these, instead discussing unrelated symptoms, allergies, and triggers.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absence of explicit questions present in transcript (e.g., D-7 to D-8, D-10, D-11, D-13, D-31); introduces unverifiable 'knowledge graph' and infers ungrounded diagnoses like asthma/allergic bronchitis not tied to queried symptoms; multiple fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on specific screening questions (fever, runny nose, etc.) and responses narrowing differential; Generated denies questions exist and pivots to overall symptoms/history/diagnoses, failing to address the query directly."
