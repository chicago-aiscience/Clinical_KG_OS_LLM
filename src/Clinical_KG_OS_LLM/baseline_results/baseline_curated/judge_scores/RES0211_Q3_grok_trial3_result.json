  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core symptoms (dry cough [P-1], scratchy throat [P-1], subjective fever [P-7, D-58], headache [P-1, D-58]) and absences (no sputum [implied via dry cough], no GI symptoms, no joint pain) that align with the Gold Answer's description of URI support. Minor discrepancies include not detailing the fever as day/night persistent [P-9], omitting malaise [P-14, D-15], fatigue [P-13], 3-4 day timeline as typical URI progression [P-1, P-3], and brother exposure [P-39]; however, no major factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: scratchy throat [P-4 equiv P-1], dry cough [P-1,P-4], subjective fever [P-7,P-9 equiv], headache [P-1,P-2], no sputum/phlegm [P-5,P-6], no nausea/vomiting [P-11], no diarrhea [P-12], no joint pain [P-13], doctor summary [D-58]. Missed: general malaise [P-14,D-15], fatigue [P-13], explicit 3-4 day URI timeline, brother cold exposure [P-39]. Covers ~85% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: symptoms directly from [P-1,P-7,D-58]; absences from transcript (though GI/joint explicitly denied [P-11-13], sputum [P-5,P-6]). Hallucinations: non-existent 'knowledge graph'; misattributes sputum question to [D-58] (actual [D-5,D-6]); 'plugged up' [P-18] is allergy-related, not sputum; vague 'likely asked about' for absences despite direct quotes available. Multiple unverifiable/misleading details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how specified symptoms and absences support URI diagnosis with structured evidence from transcript, perfectly focused on question despite minor extraneous KG reference."
