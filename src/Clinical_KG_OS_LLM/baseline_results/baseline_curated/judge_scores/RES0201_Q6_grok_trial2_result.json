  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately quotes the doctor's assessment from [D-43] and correctly identifies the symptoms (sore throat and difficulty breathing) as aligning with COVID-19 symptoms, matching the Gold Answer. It precisely lists the two diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray) with correct citations and paraphrases the X-ray purpose consistently with the transcript. Isolation instructions and conditions for continuation (even if negative, if symptomatic) are factually identical to Gold and transcript. No contradictions or errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: assessment ('in line with common symptoms of COVID-19'), specific tests (COVID swab, chest X-ray), isolation until results, continued isolation if symptomatic even after negative result. Partially covered: rationale for X-ray tied to breathing difficulty [P-8,P-9,P-10] and COPD [P-27]; 'heads up' framing, consulting supervising physician [D-1,D-44], patient acknowledgment [P-43,P-44]. Covers core 80-99% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: assessment and plan in [D-43]; symptoms in [P-2-P-10, etc.]; citations accurate. X-ray purpose paraphrases 'get an idea of what's going on in there' [D-43] without addition. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question by structuring response around assessment, diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, and conditions for continued isolation, with no off-topic content."
