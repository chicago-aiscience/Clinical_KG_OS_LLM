It identifies the symptoms, the patient's history, and the doctor's specific logic in the assessment (linking the worsening of chronic symptoms to the past history in D-52). It matches the Gold Answer's coverage of key points effectively.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The descriptions of symptoms and the doctor's reasoning are accurately reflected. Citations provided ([P-1], [P-6], [D-52]) correspond correctly to the information stated. Although it mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the input, the clinical content itself is entirely faithful to the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question regarding the symptoms used for diagnosis and the doctor's linking logic."
