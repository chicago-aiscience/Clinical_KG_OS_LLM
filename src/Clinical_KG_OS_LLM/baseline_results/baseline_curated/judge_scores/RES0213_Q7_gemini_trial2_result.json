  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer captures the core relationship between stress, anxiety, and chest pain. However, it misses several specific factual markers found in the Gold Answer and transcript, such as the patient starting smoking at age 18, the escalation to 10 cigarettes/day over the last two years, and the crucial detail of her father's heart attack which contributes to her current worry. It also includes references to a 'Knowledge Graph' which does not exist in the provided source.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer's timeline: the age she started smoking (18), the eight-year period of being symptom-free of anxiety, the specific escalation of smoking history, and the father's heart attack. The prompt specifically asked to start the timeline from when she began smoking, but the generated answer starts with her current attempt to quit.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates references to a 'Knowledge Graph' (e.g., '[MEDICAL_HISTORY] anxiety attacks') and specific causative links that it attributes to this external structure rather than the transcript alone. While the clinical symptoms are grounded, the attribution to a non-existent graph is a faithfulness error.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer addresses the general topics (smoking, stress, anxiety, chest pain) but fails to follow the specific structural instruction to 'trace the timeline... starting from when she began smoking'. It presents a thematic analysis rather than the requested chronological history."
