  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly captures several core chest-pain features from the Gold Answer: sharp/strong quality with deep inspiration (pleuritic feature) and ~20-minute episode duration, and that it tends to be noticed when walking alone or studying and is less noticeable when engaged with others or tasks. However, it overstates causation/triggering by saying the pain is “linked to stress and anxiety.” In the transcript, the patient only speculates it “could be stress” and otherwise says they don’t know a trigger; the Gold Answer similarly emphasizes no clear trigger (other than deep breath) and context of being alone. The statement implying non-occurrence “outside of episodes involving an anxiety attack” is not supported; P-20 discusses palpitations with anxiety attacks, not chest pain. These issues lower factual accuracy vs the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) sharp/strong pain with deep breath, (2) ~20-minute intermittent episodes, (3) occurs when alone walking/studying, (4) tends to go away/be unnoticed when talking to people/doing tasks. Missing from Gold Answer content: (a) symptom course for ~1.5 weeks, (b) initial description as “uncomfortable/odd,” (c) explicit statement that episodes recur “here and there” through the day (intermittency), (d) confirmation it can occur at rest, (e) not worse with exercise / walking ‘stays the same’ and no strenuous exercise, (f) no accident/injury, (g) no prior similar pain. Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in transcript (P-3, P-6, P-29). However, attributing the pain to stress/anxiety as a “trigger” is stronger than what the patient states (speculation only). The reference to anxiety attacks (cited to P-20) is not faithful to the chest-pain description and misuses that line (it concerns heart fluttering). These represent some unsupported/inaccurate extrapolation, though not pervasive fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on the requested characteristics (quality, episode duration, when it occurs vs resolves) and does not add major irrelevant material."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is relevant and captures several central pain features (pleuritic sharp pain, ~20-minute episodes, occurs when alone/studying and less noticeable when engaged), but it misses multiple Gold Answer details and over-attributes the pain to stress/anxiety with one unsupported claim tied to anxiety attacks."
