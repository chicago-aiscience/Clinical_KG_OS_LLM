{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer regarding the patient's symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness), the history of asthma since age eight, and the triggers (cold air, exercise, pollen).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a significant portion of the gold answer's reasoning: the exclusion of other respiratory conditions. The gold answer details the 'negative screening' for infectious etiologies (denial of fever, sick contacts, travel, GI symptoms, and productive cough) which specifically addresses the 'rather than a new respiratory condition' part of the prompt. It also misses the detail that wheezing occurs even more frequently than bronchodilator use.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the provided transcript. It correctly cites speaker tags (e.g., [P-1], [P-15]). Although it references a 'knowledge graph' not explicitly provided in the text, the clinical inferences drawn are standard medical knowledge consistent with the transcript's context.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt, explaining why the symptoms and medication use point toward asthma worsening. However, by omitting the 'rule-out' section, it is less effective at explaining why it is *not* a new condition."
