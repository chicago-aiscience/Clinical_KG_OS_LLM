  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details physical exam (vitals incl. temp context, chest auscultation), COVID swab, labs (bloodwork implied), clinical impression (COPD exacerbation from infection), disposition based on labs/vitals, attending consult, patient agreement. Generated covers exams (physical, vitals, chest), COVID swab, labs/vitals in criteria, attending consult accurately. Minor discrepancies: omits explicit clinical impression and patient agreement (not core to question's listed elements), says 'rule out infection' vs. specifically 'COVID', adds unverified 'knowledge graph'. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1. Physical exam/vitals/chest; 2. COVID swab + labs; 3. Clinical impression; 4. Disposition criteria (labs/vitals); 5. Attending consult; 6. Patient agreement. Generated covers 1, partial 2 (COVID explicit, labs implied), 4, 5 (~80-99%; misses impression, agreement, temp context). Matches question's focus on exams/tests/consults/criteria.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from [D-43]: physical exam/vitals/chest ('do a physical exam... vitals... listen to your chest'), COVID swab ('covid swab'), labs/vitals decision ('labs... vital signs'), attending ('talk to my attending'), disposition phrasing matches. 'Ruling out other potential causes' grounded in 'rule out covid... instead of other things'. Introductory 'knowledge graph' minor unverifiable but not hallucinatory content affecting plan.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around question's elements (examinations, tests, consultations, criteria) with bullet points matching exactly, no tangents or off-topic content."
