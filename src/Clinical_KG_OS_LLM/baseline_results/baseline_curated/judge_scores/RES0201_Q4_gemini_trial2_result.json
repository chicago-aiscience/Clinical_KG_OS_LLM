  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer failed to identify most of the symptoms denied by the patient. The Gold Answer lists cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, recent sick contacts, and travel, whereas the Generated Answer only identifies 'loss of smell'. Additionally, the Generated Answer uses positive findings (difficulty breathing) to explain differential exclusions for Mono and Strep, whereas the question specifically asked how 'negative findings' help distinguish these conditions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. It missed approximately 90% of the negative findings identified in the Gold Answer. It also failed to discuss how the absence of cough, runny nose, or fever contributes to the clinical reasoning, focusing instead on a single negative finding and several positive findings.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer introduces medical reasoning about Strep Throat and Influenza that is not present in the transcript nor the Gold Answer. Specifically, it claims anosmia is a 'primary symptom' of common cold/influenza to differentiate it from COVID-19, which is clinically questionable as loss of taste/smell is more specifically associated with COVID-19.",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer attempts to answer both parts of the question, it focuses on positive symptoms (sore throat, breathing difficulty) for the second part of the prompt, which asked for the significance of the negative findings (denied symptoms)."
