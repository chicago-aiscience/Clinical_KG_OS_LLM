  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the three immediate next steps from [D-58] (physical exam, consultation with physician, follow-up discussion), matching the Gold Answer exactly. The environmental factor of carpets is correctly stated from [P-54], including that they are new, with no factual errors, contradictions, or additions not in the transcript or Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: plan includes three steps (fully covered); offering questions to mother (missed); no specific tests/imaging/meds (not explicitly noted); environmental factors (smoking [P-53], new carpets six months ago [P-54], no pets [P-55], no wood-burning [P-56], air filters changed [P-57], townhouse [P-50], family composition [P-49] — only carpets partially covered, missing 6 others). Covers full plan (~50% of content) but only ~20% of environmental details, overall 20-49% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript: plan from [D-58], carpets from [P-54]. Citations accurate. No hallucinated facts, unverifiable details, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question's two parts (doctor's plan with exams/consults/follow-up, and home environmental factors assessed before plan). Structured response with no irrelevant or off-topic content."
