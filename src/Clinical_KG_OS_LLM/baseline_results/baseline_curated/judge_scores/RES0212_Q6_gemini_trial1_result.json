  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's plan to review the case with other doctors. However, it incorrectly states that the doctor conveyed a diagnosis of 'respiratory infection' to the patient; in the transcript [D-47], the doctor only summarizes symptoms without naming a diagnosis. It also relies on a 'Knowledge Graph' not present in the source text to justify this diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The answer addresses all three parts of the question. It misses the Gold Answer's detail about the doctor likely being a trainee and the patient's specific comments regarding exercise. It captures the main summary of symptoms well.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer repeatedly references a 'Knowledge Graph' that was not provided in the source transcript or context, which constitutes a hallucination of external evidence. It also claims the doctor characterized the condition as a 'respiratory infection', which is an inference not explicitly supported by the doctor's words in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, structuring its response to directly address the three components of the user's question."
