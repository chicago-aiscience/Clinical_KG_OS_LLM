  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims there is insufficient data and states that only patient statements (P-1 through P-35) are provided, with no doctor statements. This is factually INCORRECT. The transcript clearly shows doctor statements labeled [D-1] through [D-38], with the critical closing statements [D-37] and [D-38] containing the exact information requested. The Generated Answer completely contradicts the Gold Answer and misrepresents the available transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) the doctor consulting with another physician, (2) the collaborative decision-making process, (3) the plan to return shortly, (4) potential diagnostic testing, (5) the patient's acknowledgment, and (6) any of the specific dialogue from D-37 and D-38. Instead, it incorrectly claims this information is unavailable.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is NOT faithful to the transcript. It makes a false claim that 'only patient statements (labeled [P-1] through [P-35])' exist and that 'there are no doctor statements (labeled with [D-xx]).' This is demonstrably false as the transcript clearly contains doctor statements D-1 through D-38. The answer fabricates a justification for not answering based on allegedly missing data that is actually present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question. Instead of providing the requested information about next steps, decision-making involvement, and follow-up actions, it incorrectly claims the information is unavailable. This is completely off-topic given that the required information exists in the transcript."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely flawed across all dimensions. It falsely claims that doctor statements are missing from the transcript when they are clearly present (D-1 through D-38). This fundamental error leads to a complete failure to address the question. The answer provides zero coverage of the actual next steps discussed in D-37 and D-38, contradicts the Gold Answer entirely, and fabricates reasons for not answering. This represents a critical hallucination (claiming missing data that exists) and complete irrelevance to the question asked."
