  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to both the transcript and the Gold Answer. It claims the doctor did not ask about fever, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, rashes, or phlegm, but the transcript clearly includes all of these questions and answers: fever [D-7/P-7], runny nose [D-8/P-8], sick contacts [D-10/P-10], travel [D-11/P-11], rashes [D-13/P-13], and phlegm [D-31/P-31]. It also shifts the conclusion toward “asthma and viral bronchitis” rather than describing the doctor’s screening/exclusion intent (infectious/systemic causes vs reactive airway), which is the focus of the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses nearly all key elements from the Gold Answer: it does not identify the screening targets tied to each question (infectious causes like pneumonia/bronchitis, URI/viral-induced wheeze, contagious exposure, travel/exposure-related infections, systemic/allergic/viral rash illnesses, productive vs nonproductive cough), and it omits the patient’s actual negative responses that narrowed the differential (no fever, no runny nose, no sick contacts, no travel, no rash, no phlegm). It also omits the pain question/denial and “looks fine otherwise” contextual narrowing emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is poorly grounded in the transcript. The central assertion (that these questions were not asked) directly contradicts the transcript. It introduces unverifiable or extraneous elements (“knowledge graph,” “allergic bronchitis,” “chronic pattern of viral illness”) and over-interprets prior “viral infections” without aligning to what the Gold Answer and transcript support. While some details are transcript-grounded (wheezing, cold trigger, seasonal allergies), the major claims are fabricated/incorrect.",
    "relevance": "It partially engages with differential diagnosis but does not answer the actual question (what conditions were being screened out via the specific questions and what responses narrowed the differential). Instead it incorrectly states those questions were not asked and then provides a tangential discussion about asthma/viral bronchitis."
