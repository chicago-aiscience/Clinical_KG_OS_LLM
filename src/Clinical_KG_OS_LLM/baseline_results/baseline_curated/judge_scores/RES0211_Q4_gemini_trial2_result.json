  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by stating that the transcript does not contain information regarding eczema, EpiPen use, and night sweats. In reality, these are explicitly discussed in the transcript (D-9/P-9 for night sweats, D-21/P-21 for EpiPen, and D-32/P-33 for eczema). It also misattributes the screening for asthma to the summary in D-58 rather than the specific inquiry in D-29.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses nearly all the specific screenings identified in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention productive cough (phlegm), family history details (cousin vs. parents), skin changes, GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and joint pain. It covers less than 20% of the key points found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a failure of faithfulness by claiming the source transcript lacks specific information that is clearly present. This is a 'negative hallucination' where the model denies the existence of provided evidence.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question but focuses on medication history and general symptoms rather than the specific targeted conditions requested. By incorrectly claiming the specific examples provided in the prompt were not in the text, it fails to be fully relevant to the user's inquiry."
