  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the medication and the headache as the target symptom. It accurately lists the supportive measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep) and the use of Tylenol for fever and aches as recommended by the doctor.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer. It fails to mention 'NSAIDs' as a recommended medication for aches. It also completely omits the doctor's instructions for a COVID-19 swab test and the 14-day isolation period, which were significant parts of the management plan in the gold answer. Additionally, it omits the patient's self-initiated hydration mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript, including the specific locations of the headache mentioned in [P-5] and the management steps in [D-52].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the components of the user's multi-part question, although it is less comprehensive than the gold answer regarding the full management plan."
