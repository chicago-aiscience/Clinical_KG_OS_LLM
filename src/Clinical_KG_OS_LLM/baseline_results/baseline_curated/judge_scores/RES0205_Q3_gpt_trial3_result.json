  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis and correctly states that testing was negative (patient: “I have had the covid test and I don't have it” [P-35]). It appropriately links the investigation to being a hospital worker and having viral/flu-like symptoms with a persistent cough. Minor inaccuracy: it states the cough “has worsened into a dry cough,” whereas the transcript indicates the cough intensity is “kind of the same” [P-7] and that it transitioned from initially productive to dry [P-6], not necessarily worsening. This is a minor discrepancy and does not change the core conclusion.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: COVID-19 investigated; prompts included hospital work/possible exposure, flu-like symptoms (runny nose/sore throat), persistent cough, and coworker concern; testing negative. Missing Gold Answer details: timing of the test (~2 weeks ago at symptom onset [P-36]); patient wearing PPE/being careful [P-17]; patient stayed home since testing awaiting symptom improvement before returning to work [P-36]. Overall coverage is substantial but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate references. The main faithfulness issue is the characterization that the cough “worsened,” which is not supported (patient reports intensity about the same [P-7]). Otherwise, no major hallucinations; statements about hospital worker status, flu-like symptoms resolving, coworker fear, and negative COVID test are grounded in cited lines.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what was asked: the diagnosis investigated, what prompted investigation, and what testing showed. No meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate and well-focused, correctly identifying COVID-19 and a negative test, but it omits several Gold Answer details (test timing, PPE, staying home) and slightly overstates symptom worsening."
