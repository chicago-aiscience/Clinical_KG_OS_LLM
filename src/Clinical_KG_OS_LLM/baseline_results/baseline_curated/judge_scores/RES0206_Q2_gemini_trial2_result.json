  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the two types of inhalers and their frequencies (daily maintenance and bi-weekly rescue), the lack of antihypertensive medication, and the use of lifestyle modifications (walking and weight loss). It also correctly notes the patient's reported blood pressure status as 'OK'.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary components of the question: medications, frequencies, and the reasoning for no hypertension medication. However, it misses a few secondary management details included in the gold answer, such as the fact that the patient does not use home oxygen and has quit smoking as part of her COPD management.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It uses appropriate citations (e.g., [P-26], [P-23]). It mentions 'dietary adjustments', which is a reasonable clinical inference from 'lost weight' and 'lifestyle changes' mentioned in [P-23/24], though not explicitly stated as a diet plan.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the prompt: COPD management, hypertension management/reasoning, and inhaler frequency."
