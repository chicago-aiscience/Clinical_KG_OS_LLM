  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the respiratory symptoms (sudden shortness of breath [P-1] and dry cough [P-4]), neurological symptom (seizure the previous night and epilepsy [P-8]), and fever measurement (37.4 degrees, mild [P-5]), all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. It includes a minor additional detail about missing medication [P-9] which is factual but not emphasized in Gold; no contradictions or errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: sudden-onset SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure previous night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], fever 37.4C mild morning [P-5]. Missed: explicit sudden onset of cough that morning [D-2, P-2], ~3-hour duration [P-11], felt 'fine after' seizure and went to bed [P-8], fever confirmation as morning [D-6, P-6], pertinent negatives. Covers core symptoms and measurement (~80-90%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure/epilepsy [P-8], missed med [P-9], fever [P-5]. No hallucinated facts or inaccurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around specific respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and fever measurement; no off-topic content."
