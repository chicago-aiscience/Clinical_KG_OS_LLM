    "correctness": "The core diagnosis (anxiety-/stress-related chest pain) aligns with the Gold Answer and is supported by the situational pattern and distraction effect. However, there are minor factual/mapping errors: (1) the answer states she has a “hard time breathing” as a symptom of anxiety; in the transcript she clarifies she does not have intrinsic breathing difficulty and only breathes faster when she gets nervous, and it’s “hard to get a deep breath” because of nervousness [P-19]. (2) It uses [P-20] to support prior anxiety-related chest pain (“pain has felt like that before”), but [P-20] is about palpitations/heart flutter during anxiety attacks, not chest pain; the better support for anxiety history is [P-21, P-22]. Overall, these are minor discrepancies; the main conclusion remains correct.",
    "completeness": "Covers several key Gold points: situational pattern when alone/studying/walking and improvement with distraction/social engagement [P-29]; links to stress as possible cause [P-8]; mentions current stress [P-13]. Missing multiple supporting observations emphasized in the Gold Answer: explicit thesis/time-crunch stress details [P-15, P-16]; explicit history/possible return of anxiety attacks with correct citations [P-21, P-22]; and the pertinent negatives used to support anxiety over organic disease (no fever [P-12], no exertional worsening [P-10], occurs at rest [D-11/P-11], no palpitations outside anxiety [P-20], no asthma [P-23, P-24]). Net coverage is partial (~50–79%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript, particularly the alone-with-thoughts trigger and distraction relief [P-29], and stress consideration [P-8]. But there is at least one notable citation misuse: [P-20] is used to support prior chest-pain episodes with anxiety, whereas it actually supports palpitations only. Also, the “psychosomatic mechanism” statement is not in the transcript (though it’s a reasonable inference). These issues reduce grounding to moderate.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question: it identifies the likely diagnosis and lists consultation observations supporting it. No substantial off-topic content."
