  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the physical exam (chest-focused), diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate), timeline (24-48 hours), and disposition criteria (based on test results). The added 'Clinical Impression' section from [D-36] is factually correct and provides relevant context but is not part of the Gold Answer's core management plan; no contradictions or errors present.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical examination planned ('look at chest and physical exam', proceeding to it [D-37,D-38]); diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab [D-37]); self-isolation instructions ('stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate as much as possible' from doctor [D-37]); timeline (24-48 hours [D-37]); criteria ('based on those results' for hospital vs home [D-37]). Missed: explicit mention of public health nurse contacting if positive results [D-37]; note on no specific numerical thresholds. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: impression [D-36], PE [D-37,D-38], tests/self-isolation/timeline/criteria [D-37]. No hallucinations in clinical content; minor unverifiable phrase 'knowledge graph' does not affect core grounding.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question's elements (tests, PE, self-isolation with source, timeline, criteria) with clear headings; added clinical impression is a minor relevant tangent providing context without derailing focus."
