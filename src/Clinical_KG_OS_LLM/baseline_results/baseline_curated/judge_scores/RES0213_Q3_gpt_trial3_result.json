  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s main diagnostic conclusion (anxiety-/stress-induced chest pain) matches the Gold Answer. Most supporting observations align with the transcript (symptoms when alone/with thoughts; improvement with distraction; stress as possible contributor).\n\nHowever, there are minor factual issues:\n- It states the patient said the pain has “felt like that before” during anxiety episodes and cites [P-20]. In the transcript, [P-20] refers to palpitations/heart flutter during anxiety attacks, not the chest pain itself.\n- It describes “hard time breathing” as a symptom; the patient actually says she does not have intrinsic breathing difficulty, but becomes nervous and breathes faster, and it’s hard to get a deep breath because of nervousness [P-19].\n\nThese are not enough to overturn the core correctness but do reduce accuracy versus the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered:\n- Situational pattern: occurs when alone walking/studying; less noticeable/resolves with social distraction/tasks (covered, mainly via [P-29]).\n- Stress as a possible cause and presence of stress (covered [P-8], [P-13]).\n- Physiologic anxiety features during episodes (breathing faster; difficulty with deep breath due to nervousness) (partially covered [P-19]).\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed or underdeveloped:\n- Clear history of prior anxiety attacks as a teenager and concern they may return, with correct citations [P-21], [P-22] (not explicitly used; instead relies on a weaker/mistaken [P-20] reference).\n- Major current stressor details: Masters thesis deadline/time crunch [P-15], [P-16].\n- Pertinent negatives that support anxiety over cardiopulmonary causes: no fever [P-12], no exertional worsening [P-10], occurs at rest [D-11, P-11], no palpitations outside anxiety episodes [P-20], no asthma [P-23, P-24].\n\nOverall, it captures the central rationale but omits several supporting elements emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript and the cited quotes broadly support the situational/distraction pattern and stress association.\n\nUnfaithful/unsupported elements include:\n- Misattribution that chest pain “felt like that before” during anxiety episodes with citation [P-20]; [P-20] discusses palpitations during anxiety, not chest pain.\n- Overstates dyspnea as “hard time breathing,” whereas the patient denies baseline breathing difficulty and attributes the sensation to nervousness [P-19].\n\nBecause these are multiple citation/interpretation issues (though not wholesale fabrication), faithfulness is reduced to mid-range.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question: (1) identifies the diagnosis (anxiety/stress-related chest pain) and (2) lists consultation observations supporting that reasoning. No major irrelevant tangents."
