    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer correctly identifies the plan from [D-33] as relaying information to another doctor for evaluation. Generated Answer incorrectly states that concluding remarks and plan are not included, claiming transcript ends at [P-29], which contradicts the full transcript including [D-33] and [P-33]. For key info, Generated covers some symptoms (sharp pain on deep breath, triggers), family history, anxiety, stress, smoking, but omits duration (1.5 weeks), episode length (20 min), relief by distraction, not worsened by exercise, failed OTC meds, many pertinent negatives (no trauma, fever, asthma, dyspnea, family sudden death), psychosocial details (thesis, living alone, multivitamin). Major contradiction on plan presence and partial inaccuracies make it mostly incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) Plan from [D-33] - completely missed. (2) Symptoms: partial (sharp, deep breath, triggers, rest) - misses 1.5 weeks, 20 min, distraction relief, no exercise worsening. (3) Failed OTC - missed. (4) Pertinent negatives - misses most (trauma, fevers, asthma, dyspnea, palpitations outside anxiety, family sudden death/arrhythmias). (5) History: partial (anxiety, smoking, father MI). Psychosocial: partial (stress, school). Covers roughly 25-30% of points (some symptoms, history fragments), so 20-49%.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites transcript accurately where used (e.g., [P-3], [P-19]), but hallucinates that transcript ends at [P-29] (ignores [D-30] to [D-33]). Repeatedly references non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' or 'KG' for categorizations/links (e.g., 'sharp pain with deep breath --[LOCATED_AT]--> [LOCATION] chest', 'heart disease concern'), which is fabricated. Claims like 'absent palpitations [KG]' loosely based on [P-20] but unverifiable via KG. Multiple hallucinations about input structure/content.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for stated plan from concluding remarks AND key clinical info gathered. Generated directly denies plan exists/missing ('not included'), then partially lists key info under categories (symptoms, history, risk factors, triggers), which somewhat addresses second part but ignores first entirely and adds irrelevant KG references. Partially relevant with off-topic denial and fabrications."
