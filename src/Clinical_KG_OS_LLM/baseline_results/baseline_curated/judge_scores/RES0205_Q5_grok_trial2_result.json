  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient's history of acid reflux (managed by diet [P-22, P-25]), hay fever [P-27], and occupational exposure as a hospital clerk with PPE use [P-17, P-34], consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. It correctly notes the post-viral pattern where flu-like symptoms resolved but cough persisted [P-14]. However, it attributes more direct contributions (e.g., hay fever 'likely contributes to baseline airway sensitivity, which can prolong symptoms'; occupational exposure as the 'initial trigger') than the Gold Answer's cautious phrasing ('potentially relevant', no active hay fever contribution, occupational risk despite precautions). It omits explicit mention of no medications for reflux [P-23], which Gold uses to infer incomplete control. Minor interpretive discrepancies, but core facts match.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: acid reflux history/management without meds and potential incomplete control [P-22,23,25] (partially, misses no meds); hay fever as airway sensitivity history but no current/active role [P-27] (covered as contributing sensitivity, misses no active role); occupational exposure risk despite PPE [P-17,34] (covered well); post-viral context [P-14] (covered). Additional Gold points like anxiety [P-22] and coworker distress [P-35] missed. Covers ~85-90% of key points on the three main factors and persistence, missing some nuances.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., reflux [P-22,25], hay fever [P-27], hospital/PPE [P-17,34], symptoms [P-2,5,14,15]). Interpretations like reflux causing airway irritation or hay fever predisposing to prolonged symptoms are plausible medical inferences grounded in the history, not hallucinations. No fabricated facts; references match content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by structuring analysis around acid reflux, hay fever, and occupational exposure as contributors to persistent cough outlasting other symptoms, with symptom timing and citations focused on the query. Includes relevant presentation details but no off-topic content."
