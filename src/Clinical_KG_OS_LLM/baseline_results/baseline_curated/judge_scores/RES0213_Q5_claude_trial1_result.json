  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately represents the key facts from the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the father's heart attack in his 50s, the smoking history (18 years old start, escalation to 10 cigarettes/day, current reduction to ~5/day), and the psychosocial stressors (Masters thesis, living alone, time pressure). The answer also correctly notes the patient's explicit connection between these factors and her concern [P-8], her acknowledgment that it might be stress-related, and the return of anxiety symptoms. There are no factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: (1) family history with father's heart attack in 50s and current cardiac care [P-8, P-30], plus unknown paternal grandfather history [P-30]; (2) complete smoking timeline from age 18 to current reduction attempts [P-13, P-14, P-18]; (3) psychosocial stressors including Masters thesis deadline, living alone, and exercise concerns [P-15, P-16, P-26-28]; (4) the patient's explicit connections between factors - stating she's 'scared' [P-8], uncertain if stress-related [P-8], becoming nervous during episodes [P-19], and noting return of anxiety attacks [P-22]. The answer provides comprehensive coverage of the interaction between these factors.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with appropriate citations. The answer accurately quotes and references specific patient statements [P-3, P-8, P-13, P-19, P-29] and correctly interprets the clinical context. There is no hallucination or fabrication of information. The answer remains grounded in the source material while providing clinical interpretation that is consistent with the presented facts.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with the patient's heart disease concern, with specific illustrative details from the consultation. The structured breakdown clearly delineates each factor's contribution and their interactions, maintaining focus throughout without tangential content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an exemplary evaluation that fully aligns with the Gold Answer. It accurately captures all factual details regarding the father's cardiac history, the patient's smoking timeline, and current psychosocial stressors. The answer comprehensively covers how these three factors contribute to and interact with the patient's heart disease concern, providing specific transcript citations [P-8, P-13, P-19, P-22, P-29, P-30] that illustrate these connections. All claims are faithfully grounded in the source material with no hallucinations. The response is perfectly focused on answering the question with a clear structure that addresses contribution, interaction, and illustration for each factor. The clinical interpretation is appropriate and adds value without introducing unsupported claims."
