  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two primary risk factors: the missed dose of Keppra and the family history (maternal). It accurately links these to the seizure episode and the underlying epilepsy diagnosis, matching the clinical facts presented in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses some specific details found in the Gold Answer, such as the context behind the missed medication (the daughter's 16th birthday celebration disrupting the routine) and the mention that the patient's seizures are typically infrequent and well-controlled. It covers roughly 60-70% of the key contextual points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information. The prompt requires evaluating against the provided transcript, which contains no mention of a 'knowledge graph.' While the clinical logic derived from this 'graph' is medically sound, it is an external attribution not present in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, providing sections for the medication-related risk, the hereditary risk, and the specific relation to the epilepsy diagnosis."
