    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key factual elements from the transcript. It correctly identifies the physical examination components (heart and lungs auscultation, quick physical exam) and accurately describes the collaborative consultation process. All facts align with statements [D-37] and are consistent with the Gold Answer's description.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the essential components from the Gold Answer: (1) physical examination components specified, and (2) the consultation process described. However, it omits several contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the foreshadowing at [D-1], the collaborative nature being explicit ('supervising physician'), patient agreement [P-37], and the analytical note about no diagnosis/medication being provided at this stage. It covers approximately 70% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-37]. The direct quotes are accurate and properly cited. There is no hallucination or fabrication of content. The answer stays grounded in what was explicitly stated in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's three components: (1) the plan at end of consultation, (2) physical examination components specified, and (3) the process for determining next steps. There is no irrelevant content, and the answer is well-focused on what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate and well-grounded response that directly addresses all components of the question. It correctly identifies the physical examination components and consultation process with appropriate citations. However, it lacks the contextual depth and completeness of the Gold Answer, omitting important details about the collaborative framework, patient agreement, and clinical reasoning context. The answer demonstrates strong correctness, faithfulness, and relevance, but moderate completeness."
