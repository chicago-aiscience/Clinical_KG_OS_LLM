  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies that all three symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough) began approximately two days prior [P-1], aligning with Gold's core fact of simultaneous onset. It notes no worsening or fluctuation, consistent with Gold, but omits specific confirmations of simultaneity for cough [P-6] and consistency for symptoms [P-5, P-8]. For prior experience, conclusion is correct (no prior similar symptoms), but cites irrelevant exchanges [D-23, P-33] instead of direct denial [P-3], introducing factual error in sourcing. Minor to some errors, main points correct.",
    "completeness": "Covers: onset ~2 days ago for all three symptoms; no worsening/fluctuation; no prior similar symptoms. Misses: explicit confirmation cough started same time [D-6/P-6]; specific 'consistent' descriptions for sensory symptoms and cough [P-5/P-8]; details on partial sensory losses persisting [P-4]; doctor's COVID note [D-39]. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Onset claim grounded in [P-1]; mild cough and no worsening inferred but supported indirectly; however, prior symptoms claim uses incorrect citations ([D-23] chronic conditions, [P-33] alcohol, not relevant to symptom history), while actual grounding is [P-3]. Multiple citation errors qualify as hallucinated sourcing despite correct conclusions.",
    "relevance": "Directly and fully addresses question on symptom timeline relative to each other, progression/worsening/fluctuation, and prior experience; no off-topic content."
