  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core symptoms reported in the transcript. It correctly identifies the dry cough, breathing difficulties, and wheezing. However, it omits the important detail about chest tightness (D-20, P-20) that is explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer. The frequency differences are accurately represented, though the Generated Answer is less precise about the duration (two weeks) and doesn't capture that wheezing occurs more frequently than bronchodilator use.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 75% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It includes: dry cough, breathing difficulties, wheezing, and daytime vs nighttime frequency differences. However, it misses: (1) chest tightness as a fourth symptom, (2) the two-week duration of symptoms, (3) the detail that the cough is non-productive (confirmed by asking about 'bringing up gunk'), (4) the clarification that wheezing episodes occur more frequently than bronchodilator use, and (5) the specific trigger information (exercise, cold, recess) mentioned in context.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. All claims are verifiable: dry cough [P-1], breathing difficulties [P-1], wheezing [P-15], daytime frequency [P-1], and nighttime frequency [P-18]. The citations are accurate and there are no hallucinated facts. The answer stays true to what was actually stated in the consultation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: specific symptoms (cough, breathing difficulties, wheezing), character of symptoms (dry cough), and frequency differences between daytime and nighttime. The answer is well-focused and contains no irrelevant information. However, it could have included the chest sensation component more explicitly, as the question specifically asked about 'chest sensations.'"

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-grounded response that captures most key symptoms and correctly distinguishes daytime from nighttime frequency. It demonstrates strong faithfulness to the source material with proper citations. However, it loses points for completeness by omitting chest tightness as a symptom and missing several contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the two-week duration and the relationship between wheezing frequency and bronchodilator use."
