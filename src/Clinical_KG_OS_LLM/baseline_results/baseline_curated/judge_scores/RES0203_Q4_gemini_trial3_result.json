  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several significant factual errors regarding the transcript. It claims the patient did not explicitly deny 'difficulty breathing' (P-11), 'sore throat' (P-13), 'chills or night sweats' (P-14), or 'muscle ache/weakness' (P-15). In the transcript, the patient clearly answers 'No' or 'Uh no' to each of these specific questions. These errors undermine the accuracy of the review of systems documentation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several negative findings included in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of sputum or blood with the cough (P-7), the lack of environmental triggers for the cough (P-21), no medication use (P-24), no prior surgeries/hospitalizations (P-25), and no relevant family history (P-27). It covers approximately 60% of the negative findings mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness by claiming certain information was 'implied' or 'not explicitly stated' when the transcript contains direct, explicit denials from the patient. This represents a failure to accurately reflect the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant to the prompt, following the requested structure and addressing both the list of symptoms and the clinical significance of their absence."
