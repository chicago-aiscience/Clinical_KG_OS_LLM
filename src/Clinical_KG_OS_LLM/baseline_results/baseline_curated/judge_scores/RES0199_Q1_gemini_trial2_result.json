  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the contents of the transcript. It incorrectly claims that the frequency of diarrhea episodes is not mentioned, whereas the transcript explicitly states 'five or six times a day' [P-28]. It also fails to provide the numerical severity rating for the headache (7/10), providing instead a qualitative description.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include several specific details requested by the prompt and present in the Gold Answer. It missed the diarrhea frequency (5-6 times/day) and the numerical headache severity (7/10). It also omitted details like the cough being present for four days and the lack of sputum/blood.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a lack of information by stating the transcript does not provide a specific frequency for diarrhea, which is directly contradicted by statement [P-28].",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the specific categories requested (GI, respiratory, headache), it fails to provide the most important specific data points requested in the prompt's instructions (frequency and severity rating)."
