  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links eczema to atopic risk for asthma/reactive airways explaining chronic cough, cat allergy to atopy and hyperresponsiveness (notes no exposures), vaping to irritants impairing defenses, combo lowering threshold to acute infection. Generated similarly connects eczema to atopy/hyperresponsiveness, cat allergy to irritation (implies exposure not documented), vaping to irritants/inflammation, combo to recurrent inflammation leading to symptoms. Minor discrepancies: Generated assumes cat exposure and adds sinus congestion (not in Gold/transcript), uses [KG] erroneously, but core facts align without major errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: eczema as atopy marker -> asthma risk -> 3mo cough; cat allergy supports atopy -> hyperresponsiveness, no exposures; vaping irritants -> inflammation/impaired defenses; combo -> chronic inflammation threshold lowered -> acute sputum; no formal testing. Generated covers eczema/atopy -> susceptibility; cat allergy -> irritation/cough/mucus; vaping -> compromise/inflammation; collective high-risk -> recurrent inflammation/mucus/infection. Misses explicit 3mo cough link, no exposures note, no testing mention; adds sinus. Covers ~85-90% of keys.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims verifiable: eczema [P-22/23], cat allergy [P-27], vaping [P-36], sputum [P-9], cough [P-2], sleep [P-19]. Minor hallucinations: 'potential cat exposure' (no current exposure in transcript), 'sinus congestion' (absent), '[KG]' (not in transcript). Mostly grounded with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly analyzes the three specified factors (eczema, cat allergy, vaping) and their collective contribution to chronic/recurrent respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum), structured perfectly around the question with no off-topic content."
