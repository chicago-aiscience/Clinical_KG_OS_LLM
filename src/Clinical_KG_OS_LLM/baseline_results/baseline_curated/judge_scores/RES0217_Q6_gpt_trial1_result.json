  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly captures the core elements of the plan in the Gold Answer: quick physical exam, sending the tick for species identification, Lyme serology bloodwork, prophylactic antibiotics given suspected >72h attachment/risk, plan to speak with another physician, and preventive advice about ticks in long grass/edge areas and considering insecticide. Minor inaccuracies: it cites [D-5] for lab identification (the transcript’s lab-sending plan is at D-6/D-18), and it adds that the physical exam would assess “other potential exposures,” which is not stated. It also adds an ‘implicit’ recommendation to continue the statin, which is not part of the clinician’s end-of-visit plan in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer components covered: (1) quick physical exam; (2) tick sent to lab for species identification; (3) blood work for Lyme titres/serology; (4) prophylactic antibiotics with no specific agent/dose; (5) plan to consult/talk to the doctor/physician; (6) preventive advice about tick habitat and possible insecticide use. The answer is essentially complete with respect to what the question requests.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript. However, the statement that the patient was advised to continue the statin is not supported by the transcript (the statin is only mentioned as history). Also, the citation [D-5] used to support sending the tick to the lab is not the location where that plan is stated (it’s stated at D-6/D-18). These are minor-to-moderate faithfulness issues, but the majority of the content is verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the requested clinical plan elements (tests, treatments, consultation, prevention). The inclusion of statin continuation is a minor tangent and not part of the plan for the tick bite encounter."
