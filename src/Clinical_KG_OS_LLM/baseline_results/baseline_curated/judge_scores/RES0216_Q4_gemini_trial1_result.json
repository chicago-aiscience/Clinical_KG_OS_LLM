  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies 'cardiac ischemia' (cardiac ischemic picture in the Gold Answer) as the condition placed lower on the differential. It accurately notes the nature of the chest complaints (tightness vs. pain) and the doctor's interpretation regarding shortness of breath during exercise, which aligns with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer is partially complete. It misses a significant set of 'absent symptoms' cited in the Gold Answer, specifically the patient's denial of anxiety, sweating, and the feeling of impending doom (from P-6). These were explicitly listed in the Gold Answer as evidence for deprioritizing the condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer includes a hallucination by referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the source transcript or the provided context. However, the clinical facts extracted from the dialogue (D-36, P-5, P-1) are grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question regarding the specific condition and the symptom findings used as evidence."
