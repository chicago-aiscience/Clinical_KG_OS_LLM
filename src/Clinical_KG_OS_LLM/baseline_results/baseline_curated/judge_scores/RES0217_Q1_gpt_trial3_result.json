  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The local symptom summary (redness, tenderness, soreness of the skin behind the knee) is consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. However, the systemic symptom section contains major factual errors:\n- Fever: The Generated Answer states there is no explicit denial of fever, but the patient clearly denies feeling ill/feverish (“No, no, I’ve been fine” [P-8]).\n- Headaches: It attributes a headache denial to [P-6] and quotes “No, I don’t,” but [P-6] is about the rash; headache denial occurs at [P-19] and [P-20].\n- Joint pain: It cites the patient’s clarification about local soreness not being “the joint itself” [P-1] as the denial of joint pain, while the actual denial to the doctor’s screening is [P-7].\nThese errors affect the core asked elements (fever, joint pain, headaches).",
    "completeness": "Misses/under-covers several Gold Answer key points:\n- Local: omits that the tick was “stuck pretty good” and that she denied a bullseye/target rash (no larger circular rash), which is explicitly part of the Gold Answer.\n- Systemic: intended items are joint pain, feverish/ill, and headaches—all should be listed as screened and denied. The Generated Answer partially covers these but incorrectly claims fever denial is not explicit and mislocates the headache denial.\nOverall coverage is partial (~50–79%) due to missing the bullseye-rash negative and mishandling key systemic negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not faithfully grounded in the transcript:\n- Incorrect claim that fever was not explicitly denied (it was at [P-8]).\n- Misattributed headache denial to [P-6] with an inaccurate quote/context.\n- Joint pain denial is grounded in the transcript but supported with the wrong turn ([P-1] rather than [P-7]).\nThese issues reflect several transcript-grounding and citation problems.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the exact question: local symptoms at the bite site and systemic symptoms screened (fever, joint pain, headaches) that were denied. No major tangents."
