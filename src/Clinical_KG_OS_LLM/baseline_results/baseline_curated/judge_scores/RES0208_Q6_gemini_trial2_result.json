  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), the physical exam focus (chest), the timeline (24-48 hours), and the criteria for admission (based on results).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers nearly all key points, including the physical exam, diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, timeline, and decision criteria. However, it misses the specific detail requested in the prompt regarding 'from whom' instructions would come in the event of a positive result (the public health nurse), which is included in both the transcript [D-37] and the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript. The citations [D-36, D-37, D-38] are used correctly and correspond to the appropriate sections of the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the multi-part question. It avoids irrelevant information, though it slightly under-delivers on the 'from whom' part of the isolation instructions."
