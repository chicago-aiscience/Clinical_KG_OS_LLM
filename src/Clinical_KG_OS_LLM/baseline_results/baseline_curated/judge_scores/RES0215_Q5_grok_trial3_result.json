  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer frames these factors as an atopic/environmental profile leading to hyperresponsive airways manifesting as exercise-induced wheezing: seasonal allergies indicate atopy; recurrent virals trigger inflammation; new carpets as potential irritant (no direct link noted); cold as non-allergic trigger; ties explicitly to exercise/rest pattern. Generated covers core relations similarly but adds unsubstantiated details (VOCs/dust mites from carpets, though Gold implies irritant; 'knowledge graph' reference not in Gold/transcript) and downplays exercise trigger specificity, with minor rephrasing discrepancies. Core facts consistent, minor additions/discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: atopy from allergies/OTC [P-35/36]; virals [P-15/16] cause inflammation/hyperreactivity; carpets potential irritant no temporal link [P-54]; cold trigger [P-38]; other env ruled out [P-53-57]; exercise [P-3/41]/rest [P-6]; overall hyperresponsive atopic airways. Generated covers allergies, virals (susceptibility), carpets (irritant), cold (trigger); infers synergy; misses explicit other env factors, exercise/rest as central pattern. Covers ~85% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: citations [P-1/2/15/35/36/38/43/54] accurate to transcript for symptoms, allergies, virals, cold, carpets. Ungrounded/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph' and causal arrows entirely fabricated (no KG in inputs); new carpets releasing VOCs/harboring dust mites plausible clinically but not verifiable in transcript (Gold notes potential irritant generically, no specifics). Multiple unverifiable additions reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly breaks down each queried factor (allergies, virals, carpets, cold) and their collective relation to wheezing/distress pattern, with summary tying to synergy; includes relevant current presentation context; minor off-topic via fabricated KG, but overall focused on question."
