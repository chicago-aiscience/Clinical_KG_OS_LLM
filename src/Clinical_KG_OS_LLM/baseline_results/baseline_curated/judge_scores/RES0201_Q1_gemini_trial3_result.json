  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors. It incorrectly claims that 'cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, and chest pain' were not mentioned in the transcript, whereas the patient explicitly denied them in turns P-15, P-16, P-17, P-18, and P-23. It also completely omits 'difficulty breathing', which was a primary concern reported by the patient (P-7, P-8).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses a significant portion of the Gold Answer. It omits the symptom of difficulty breathing and fails to list 5 out of the 6 specifically requested screened symptoms (only mentioning loss of smell). It also misses the details regarding the duration and progression of the symptoms provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a false claim that certain symptoms were 'not mentioned' in the transcript. This is a form of negative hallucination (failing to recognize clear data in the source). The description of the 'loss of taste' is also contradictory and poorly grounded compared to the Gold Answer's clear identification of a reduced sense of taste.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to answer both parts of the prompt (reported symptoms and denied symptoms). However, the content provided within those sections is largely incorrect or incomplete."
