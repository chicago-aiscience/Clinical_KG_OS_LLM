  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold specifies cough for ~3 months initially dry/intermittent/recurrent, starting at pole dancing; Gen says 'at least a month' with recent worsening - factual understatement/error on duration. Sputum greenish gross gunk recent 3 days correct. No blood correct. Pain only when coughing correct (noted as 'hurts when cough'). Sleep disruption last month nightly causing fatigue correct but less detailed. Subjective fever correct. Adds eczema (historical, not associated with current respiratory issue). Denied: covers no blood and no other pain correct, but Gold has more. Minor discrepancies on duration/details, core respiratory facts mostly align - score 3.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: cough chronic/recent productive (partial), greenish sputum, gross gunk, pain when coughing, sleep disturbance/fatigue, subjective fever, no blood, no (other) pain. Missed: full 3-month duration, initial dry/intermittent/recurrent nature, onset at pole class, no foul smell sputum, specific every night last month, chest not at rest (implied), exercise impairment, denied night sweats, unexplained weight loss/loose clothes, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, sick contacts. Covers ~30-40% of detailed key points - score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: cough [P-2,P-19], pain [P-3], sputum [P-2,P-9,P-12], sleep [P-19,P-20,P-21,D-47], fever [P-4], eczema [P-22,P-23], fatigue [P-19], denied pain [P-19], no blood [P-10,D-47]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details - score 5.",
    "relevance": "Structures answer around reported respiratory (cough, sputum, pain), associated (sleep, fever, fatigue), and denied symptoms, directly matching question. Eczema is minor irrelevant addition (past history). No major off-topic content - score 4."
