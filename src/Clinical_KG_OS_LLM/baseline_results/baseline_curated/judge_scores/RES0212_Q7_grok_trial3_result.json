  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the main timeline points: 3 months cough onset [P-2], 1 month sleep disruption [P-19], 3 days productive greenish sputum [P-2, P-9, D-47], couple days subjective fevers [P-4]. Minor discrepancies include omitting the specific pole dancing onset [P-13], not describing initial cough as dry/intermittent explicitly, and imprecise sleep description ('kind of waking a little bit' vs. 'every night' [P-21]). Core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: 3mo onset, 1mo sleep disruption, 3d productive sputum, couple d fevers (80-99%). Misses: pole dancing onset [P-13], dry/intermittent for first 2mo [P-2], 'every night' sleep [P-21], fatigue [P-19], acute-on-chronic summary.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims verifiable: [P-2, P-9, P-19, P-4, D-47] match transcript. Minor hallucination: references non-existent 'knowledge graph' and 'respiratory infection indicated by KG'; doctor notes in D-47 support worsening but no KG. Mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question's timeline request (onset, sleep disruption, productive sputum, fevers) with structured, focused response; no off-topic content."
