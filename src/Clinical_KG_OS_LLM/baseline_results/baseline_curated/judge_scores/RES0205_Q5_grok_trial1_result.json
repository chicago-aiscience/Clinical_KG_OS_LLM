  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer notes acid reflux managed by diet without meds, helped 'quite a bit' but potentially not fully controlled, contributing to cough; hay fever as history of sensitivity with no current/active contribution; occupational risk despite PPE. Generated accurately covers reflux (diet management) and occupational risk (PPE, pathogen exposure), but slightly overstates hay fever's role in prolonging symptoms (Gold is more neutral, no current symptoms). Core facts consistent, minor interpretive discrepancy on hay fever assertiveness.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: reflux details ([P-22], diet [P-25], no meds [P-23], helped but incomplete control); hay fever history, no active role; occupational risk with PPE/careful [P-17,P-34]; post-viral pattern [P-14]; anxiety/work distress context. Generated covers reflux diet/history, hay fever sensitivity, occupational exposure/risk; includes symptom persistence [P-14]. Misses explicit no meds, 'helped quite a bit', hay fever lack of current symptoms, anxiety/distress. Covers 80-99% of main points on the three factors.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-22] reflux, [P-27] hay fever, [P-34/P-17] occupation/PPE, [P-14] symptom resolution). General medical knowledge on reflux/cough and hay fever sensitivity is plausible and not hallucinated; no fabricated facts, inferences grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three specified elements (acid reflux, hay fever, occupational exposure) and their relation to persistent cough outlasting other symptoms, with relevant symptom context; no off-topic content."
