  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors regarding the available information. It claims the transcript does not provide a frequency for diarrhea episodes, whereas [P-28] explicitly states 'five or six times a day.' It also fails to provide the numerical severity rating for the headache (7/10 in [P-8]), instead offering qualitative descriptions.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two out of the four specific characteristics requested: the frequency of diarrhea and the numerical severity rating of the headache. It correctly identifies the dry cough and the two vomiting episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript by claiming information (diarrhea frequency) is missing when it is clearly present in [P-28].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, as it directly attempts to address each specific component of the multi-part question, although it fails to find the correct data for half of them."
