  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it states the patient 'admitted to loss of smell (rather than retention)', whereas the transcript [P-19] and the question itself explicitly state the patient had reduced taste *without* loss of smell. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source material.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including the patient's generalized muscle aches and fatigue [P-25, P-26], and the context of potential exposure at the grocery store and bank [P-12].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinations a 'Knowledge Graph' to support its reasoning. Furthermore, it misrepresents the patient's testimony regarding their sense of smell, claiming they lost it when they explicitly said they did not [P-19].",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the general topic but fails to correctly answer the specific nuance of the question regarding the *absence* of smell loss, instead asserting that the patient did lose their sense of smell."
