  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the respiratory symptoms (sudden shortness of breath [P-1] and dry cough [P-4]), neurological symptom (seizure the previous night and epilepsy [P-8]), and fever measurement (37.4 degrees, described as mild [P-5]), all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. No factual errors or contradictions; minor omissions like exact timing details or 'Celsius' do not affect accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: sudden-onset shortness of breath upon waking [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure previous night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], fever 37.4 mild [P-5]. Missed or partially covered: cough onset timing [D-2, P-2], ~3 hours prior to consult [P-11], no sputum (implied by dry but not explicit), felt fine after seizure [P-8], morning confirmation of fever [D-6, P-6], units (Celsius), pertinent negatives. Covers ~85% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure/epilepsy [P-8], missed med context [P-9], fever 37.4 [P-5]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing specific respiratory (SOB, dry cough) and neurological (seizure/epilepsy) symptoms reported at presentation, and the objective fever measurement (37.4), with structured, focused response and no off-topic content."
