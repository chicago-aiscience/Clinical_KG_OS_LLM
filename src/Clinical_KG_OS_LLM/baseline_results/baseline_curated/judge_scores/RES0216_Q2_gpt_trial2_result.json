  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: current meds include salbutamol, ramipril (for HTN), and occasional Tylenol (for headaches). It also distinguishes two asthma inhalers (daily controller vs PRN rescue), and the key adherence change is reducing the controller from BID (AM+PM) to AM-only, plus not refilling/therefore not having the rescue inhaler available for a couple years.\n\nGenerated answer is partially correct that ramipril is for hypertension and that the patient has not refilled the rescue inhaler in a long time. However, it is factually incorrect/incomplete in several ways relative to the gold:\n- Incorrectly states the patient is taking “two distinct medications,” omitting Tylenol.\n- Does not correctly report the key adherence change: the maintenance inhaler was prescribed twice daily but he has been skipping the night dose and now takes it only in the morning.\n- It frames the maintenance inhaler use as maintained adherence, which conflicts with the transcript/gold (he is nonadherent to the prescribed BID regimen).\n- It introduces “knowledge graph confirms …” which is not part of the transcript and is not appropriate evidence.\nOverall, core elements are mixed: some correct points, but missing/incorrect key facts about adherence and med list.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer:\n1) Salbutamol mentioned as a medication (as-needed/rescue context) ✓ (mentioned)\n2) Ramipril for high blood pressure ✓ (covered)\n3) Tylenol occasionally for headaches ✗ (missed)\n4) Two inhalers: daily maintenance + PRN rescue ✓/partial (mentioned but not fully integrated)\n5) Daily inhaler prescribed BID (morning and night) ✗ (missed)\n6) Patient has been skipping evening dose “for a while” and currently AM-only ✗ (missed)\n7) Rescue inhaler not refilled for a couple years and currently not available ✓ (covered)\n8) Has not stopped daily inhaler entirely in last 3 days ✗ (missed)\n9) Summary that adherence gaps are (a) halved controller frequency and (b) no rescue available ✗/partial (only (b) captured)\n\nThis is well under full coverage; it omits the major adherence change and one of the listed meds.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded in the transcript:\n- “Knowledge graph confirms …” is not present in the source transcript.\n- Calling the medication list “two distinct medications” contradicts the transcript where the patient also reports Tylenol.\n- Describing the patient as adherent to the daily maintenance regimen is misleading relative to the transcript, where he explicitly reports prescribed BID but actually taking AM-only.\nSome elements are grounded (ramipril, not refilling rescue inhaler), but there are multiple transcript-inconsistent or unsupported claims.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked domains (current meds/indications and asthma inhaler adherence changes, including rescue availability). However, it fails to answer the most specific part of the question (how dosing frequency changed over the past couple of years), which reduces practical relevance even though the content remains on-topic."
