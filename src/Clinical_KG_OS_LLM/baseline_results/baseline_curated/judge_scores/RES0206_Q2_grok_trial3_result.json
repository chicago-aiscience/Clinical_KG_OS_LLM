  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the two inhalers (daily maintenance and rescue used ~once every two weeks) matching Gold [P-26], no antihypertensive meds, and reason (lifestyle modifications first, BP OK) [P-23]. Minor discrepancies include incorrect citation [P-1 instead of P-26] for inhalers, attributing 'walking dogs with friends outside' specifically to HTN management (tangential from P-20 exposure, while Gold/P-24 specifies personal weight loss/walking), and adding unmentioned 'dietary adjustments'. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: COPD inhalers and frequencies (100%), no antiHTN meds, reason (lifestyle first, BP OK). Partially covers HTN strategies (general lifestyle/walking, misses weight loss specifics [P-24], doctor support [D-25]). Missed: no home oxygen [P-1], no specific med names, quit smoking [P-40], rare alcohol [P-39], baseline COPD management [P-28/P-27], no allergies [P-29/30]. Covers ~60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Inhaler claims verifiable in [P-26] (citation [P-1] inaccurate but content correct); HTN claims grounded in [P-23/P-22]; exacerbation context plausible from [P-1/D-43]. 'Dietary adjustments' not in transcript (hallucination); 'walking dogs with friends outside' pulled from [P-20] exposure context, not management. Some unverifiable/miscontextualized details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address question parts (COPD meds/strategies/frequencies, HTN strategies, reason for no antiHTN meds); minor exacerbation context is relevant to current status but not off-topic."
