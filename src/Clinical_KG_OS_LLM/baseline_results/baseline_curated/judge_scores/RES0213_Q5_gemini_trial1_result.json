{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the father's heart attack in his 50s and the psychosocial stressors related to the Masters program. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating the transcript does not confirm current active smoking, whereas the transcript (P-14) and Gold Answer both confirm she currently smokes 5 cigarettes a day. It also mentions a 'knowledge graph' which does not exist in the provided context.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the paternal grandfather's early death/unknown history, the fact that the patient lives alone in London, her recent nervousness about running, and the specific duration of her smoking history (starting at age 18, 10 cigarettes/day for two years).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinations the existence of a 'knowledge graph' twice. It also contradicts the transcript regarding the patient's current smoking status (claiming it is not confirmed when the patient explicitly states she smokes 5 a day). The citations used are generally accurate for the points they support.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address the three components of the question (family history, smoking, and stressors) and their interactions."
