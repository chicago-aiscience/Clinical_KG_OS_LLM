  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misidentifies the specific constitutional symptoms denied (lists chest pain, generalized pain, fatigue instead of night sweats, unexplained weight loss, hemoptysis) and exposure risks (cites cat allergy and alcohol instead of sick contacts, travel, IV drug use); while it vaguely references weight loss/night sweats/malaise in the TB section and correctly notes TB as a concern for chronic cough, there are significant factual discrepancies and contradictions with the Gold Answer's precise listings and citations.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: partial recognition of constitutional symptoms absence and TB exclusion (about 20%); missed: specific denials of night sweats [D-5/P-5], weight loss/loose clothes [D-6-8/P-6-8], hemoptysis [D-10/P-10], stiff neck/nausea/body pain, and all exposure risks (sick contacts [D-14/15/32], travel [D-33/34], IVDU/drugs [D-39/40]), doctor's summary [D-47].",
    "faithfulness": "Some claims grounded (chest pain inquiry [D-3], tiredness [P-19], cats [P-27], alcohol [P-42], green sputum [P-9], cough duration); but multiple hallucinations/misinterpretations: cats and alcohol as 'exposure risks' (not relevant to infections), 'knowledge graph' not in transcript, bronchiectasis/chronic bronchitis not discussed, overstating denial of constitutional symptoms via stretched P-19, unverified exclusion of TB/sepsis.",
    "relevance": "Addresses screenings for symptoms/exposures and exclusion of serious conditions like TB, but largely off-topic with irrelevant details (chest pain, cats, alcohol, bronchiectasis) and diagnostic speculation (respiratory infection), diluting direct response to the question."
