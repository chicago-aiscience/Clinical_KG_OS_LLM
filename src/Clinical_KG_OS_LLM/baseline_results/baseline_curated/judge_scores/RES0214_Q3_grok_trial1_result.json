  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies fever and sore throat as the specific symptoms cited by the doctor in [D-53] for suspecting infectious etiology like COVID-19, matching the Gold Answer's explicit identification. It also correctly notes the patient's primary complaints from [P-1]. For vaccination, it precisely captures the flu shot inquiry [D-53] and the doctor's response raising influenza [D-54], consistent with Gold. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: fever and sore throat [D-53]; flu shot absence [P-53/D-53] prompting influenza [D-54]. Partially covers broader symptoms via patient's complaints [P-1] (stuffy nose, fever, sore throat). Missed: explicit broader symptom summary [D-24] (muscle aches, etc.) and epidemiological context of husband's symptoms [D-53]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: fever/sore throat from [D-53] and [P-1]; flu shot from [D-53] (question) and implied [P-53] response leading to [D-54]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question with focused sections on symptoms for infectious/COVID-19 suspicion and vaccination history for influenza differential. No off-topic content; perfectly on-point."
