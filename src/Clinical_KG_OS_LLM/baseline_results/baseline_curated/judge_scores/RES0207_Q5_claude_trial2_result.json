  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two key risk factors: medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose) and hereditary predisposition (mother had epilepsy). The facts align with the Gold Answer, including the specific medication name (Keppra), the citation [P-9] for forgetting medication, and [P-26] for family history. The answer accurately states these as causal factors for the seizure episode.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the essential elements: (1) medication-related risk (missed Keppra dose), (2) hereditary risk (mother's epilepsy), and (3) relationship between family history and diagnosis. However, it lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific circumstance of the daughter's birthday celebration disrupting the routine [P-24], the patient's acknowledgment that seizures are normally infrequent [P-9], and the implication that medication compliance provides good control. These omissions represent approximately 20-25% of key contextual points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations [P-9], [P-23], and [P-26] are accurate. However, the answer includes references to a 'knowledge graph' that establishes causal links, which is not present in the source transcript. This represents external information not grounded in the provided materials, constituting minor hallucination. The core clinical facts remain transcript-based.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) hereditary and medication-related risk factors for the seizure, and (2) how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. The content is focused and organized clearly under these topics. There is no irrelevant information, though the knowledge graph references are somewhat extraneous to answering from the transcript alone."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a highly accurate and well-organized response that correctly identifies both medication non-adherence and hereditary predisposition as risk factors for the seizure. All key facts align with the Gold Answer and are properly cited from the transcript. The answer loses minor points for: (1) missing some contextual details like the birthday celebration explanation and the infrequency of seizures when compliant, and (2) referencing a 'knowledge graph' not present in the source materials. Despite these minor issues, the answer comprehensively addresses the question with factual accuracy and clear relevance."
