  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the core diagnosis, consistent with the Gold Answer's 'pediatric asthma'. However, it lacks specificity (no mention of 'pediatric', 'exercise-induced bronchoconstriction', or 'atopic predisposition') and underemphasizes exercise triggers while overemphasizing cold weather without linking to activity as strongly as Gold. No major factual errors or contradictions, but minor discrepancies in framing supports.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: specific diagnosis phrasing, exercise-triggers [P-3,P-41,P-6], reversible with rest [P-6,P-33], cold weather [P-38], multiple settings [P-38], seasonal allergies [P-35,P-36], nocturnal episode [P-43,P-44], pertinent negatives [P-7,P-8,P-10,P-31]. Generated covers cold weather, allergies, partial intermittency [P-43]; misses exercise links, rest resolution, multiple settings, nocturnal detail, negatives, and diagnosis specificity. Covers ~40-50% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: symptoms [P-1,P-2], cold [P-38], allergies [P-35,P-36], one resolving episode [P-43]. Hallucination: '[MEDICAL_HISTORY]' and 'knowledge graph' not in transcript. Otherwise grounded with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Directly names diagnosis (asthma) and lists transcript supports, addressing question. Acknowledges prompt's activity trigger but pivots to transcript emphases; minor extraneous note on knowledge graph, but focused overall."
