  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error regarding the source text. It claims that the patient's response to the asthma screening [D-23] was not included in the transcript, but the transcript explicitly contains the patient's denial at [P-23] ('Uh no') and [P-24] ('No'). Furthermore, it misses five out of the six condition categories identified in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer identifies six categories: traumatic injury, cardiac disease/angina, infectious illness, asthma, primary dyspnea, and inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The generated answer only covers arrhythmias. This represents less than 20% coverage of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails the faithfulness check by hallucinating that the asthma response is missing from the provided transcript. This is a failure to ground the response in the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in its structure and attempt to answer the prompt, but by failing to identify most of the clinical screening performed, it provides a very limited response to the user's inquiry."
