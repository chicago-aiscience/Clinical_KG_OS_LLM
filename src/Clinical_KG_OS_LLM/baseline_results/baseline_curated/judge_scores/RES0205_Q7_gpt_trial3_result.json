  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All statements included in the Generated Answer are consistent with the transcript/Gold Answer: onset ~2 weeks; initial flu-like symptoms first couple of days; other symptoms resolved by ~3–4 days; productive cough with whitish/clear mucus for ~4–5 days; then transitioned to dry cough; persistent cough remains; cough-related chest soreness occurs after coughing a lot. No direct contradictions to the Gold Answer were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) ~2-week onset, (2) initial flu-like symptoms early, (3) other symptoms resolved by ~3–4 days (general), (4) mucus appearance (whitish/clear) and duration (4–5 days), (5) transition to dry cough after day 4–5, (6) persistent cough and chest soreness.\nKey elements missed: (1) sore throat specifically lasted 2–3 days, (2) runny nose specifically present initially, (3) no fever at any point, (4) cough intensity remained the same across 2 weeks, (5) cough frequency did not increase and was ~3–4 times/hour, (6) cough was spontaneous/no triggers, (7) COVID test negative at symptom onset and patient stayed home awaiting improvement. Because several question-required items (especially intensity/frequency trajectory) are absent, coverage is partial (~50–70%).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer stays grounded in the transcript and cites relevant turns for the claims it makes. No clear hallucinated clinical facts are added. Minor interpretive phrasing (“when the coughing is intense”) is still supported by the patient’s statement about chest discomfort when coughing too much.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the symptom timeline, but it does not fully address the question’s required components about how cough intensity and frequency changed over time (and lacks the quantitative frequency estimate and stability). It also omits specific associated-symptom timelines (sore throat/runny nose) that the question asks to include in the progression narrative."
