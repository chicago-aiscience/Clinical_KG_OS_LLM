{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, specifies that a COVID swab was ordered, gives the 48-hour turnaround time, and accurately states the isolation instruction. These are all consistent with the Gold Answer and supported by the transcript. No contradictory or incorrect facts are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) COVID-19 needs to be ruled out, (2) COVID swab ordered today, (3) results in 48 hours, (4) isolate at home and avoid others. Key point missed: the doctor also told the patient they would receive further instructions from public health once results returned. The generated answer does not include that post-result guidance.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (notably [P-1] and [D-39]) and do not add extraneous or unverifiable details. The answer stays within what was said (COVID concern, swab, 48 hours, isolate).",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question (condition, test, turnaround time, and instructions while awaiting results). No irrelevant tangents."
