  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer correctly identifies that the clinician diagnosed a likely viral URI/common cold and cites the correct statement [D-39]. It also correctly notes 1-week duration and that the doctor said symptoms can take “a few weeks” to resolve [D-39], and it accurately mentions the nephew/daycare exposure [P-11]. However, it overstates daycare exposure as a “critical factor” (the nephew was reported not sick [P-12]) and introduces non-transcript content (“provided knowledge graph,” “Knowledge Graph explicitly links…,” and treatment associations), which are not part of the source. It also fails to correctly compare viral vs allergic vs bacterial using the symptom characteristics emphasized in the Gold Answer (clear discharge, lack of fever/cough/systemic symptoms, lack of allergen exposure).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) nasal congestion/runny nose; (2) duration ~1 week and clinician note that colds can take a few weeks; (3) daycare exposure as a plausible viral exposure source (partially).\nKey points missed: absence of cough [P-4], sore throat/SOB/fever/chills [P-7], post-nasal drip [P-6]; clear discharge/no color [P-5]; progression from stuffy to mostly runny [P-3]; evidence against allergy (no allergen exposures [P-22], no known allergies [P-28], no similar recent episodes [P-9]); evidence against bacterial (no fever [P-7], no headache [P-14], clear rather than colored discharge [P-5]); acknowledgement that nephew was not sick [P-12]. Overall, it captures only a minority of the supporting evidence described in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated references to a “knowledge graph,” claims that it “explicitly links daycare exposure” to diagnosis, and that Tylenol cold/supportive care are ‘associated’ with viral infections in that graph. These are hallucinated relative to the provided transcript. The remaining cited items (symptoms, 1-week duration, daycare, clinician conclusion) are present, but the added non-source framework significantly reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (it attempts to justify why viral is favored), but it does not directly address the question’s requested contrasts (viral vs allergic vs bacterial) using the specific symptom characteristics and absent features. It focuses mainly on duration and an overstated exposure point and omits most discriminating clinical negatives (fever/cough/colored discharge/allergen exposure), so it is only partially responsive."
