  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports all mentioned symptoms with correct citations: sputum as 'yellow custard' with red spots [P-6] matches Gold and transcript; right-sided chest pain [P-17] and worsening with deep breath [P-18] aligns; fever [P-5] and chills [P-9] correct; cough [P-1] and raw throat [P-15] factual. The term 'pleuritic nature' is a reasonable medical interpretation of the pain worsening with deep breathing, consistent with Gold's description, with no contradictions or errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: cough timeline (Fri raspy, Sun severe) - missed; sputum desc (yellow custard, red spots, simultaneous Sun start) - desc covered but timeline missed; chest pain (right, constant, dull, always there even lying, worse cough/deep breath) - loc and partial quality (deep breath) covered, misses constant/dull/always/worse cough; fevers (Mon start, subjective felt hot, no measure, persisting) - basic mention, details missed; chills last 2 days - covered; DOE on stairs - missed; sore throat raw - covered; runny nose resolved - missed; no wt loss - missed. Covers ~60% of points partially to fully.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: sputum quote exact [P-6]; citations P-5,9,17,18,1,15 accurate to transcript; no fabricated facts; 'pleuritic nature' is plausible inference from [P-18,19] without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around requested elements (systemic fever/chills, chest pain loc/quality, sputum desc) with bullet points, adds closely related respiratory symptoms without digression; perfectly focused on question."
