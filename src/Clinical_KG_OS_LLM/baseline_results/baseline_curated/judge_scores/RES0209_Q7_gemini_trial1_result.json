  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the diagnosis age and the nature of the current symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing). However, it misses the patient's current age (10) and the specific frequency of baseline bronchodilator use. It also slightly misrepresents the 'near-daily' descriptor by linking it specifically to nighttime symptoms, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer apply the '5-6 times a week' (near-daily) usage to the overall exacerbation state.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points present in the Gold Answer and specifically requested in the prompt: 1) The specific baseline frequency of 'once every two weeks'; 2) The specific current frequency of 'five to six times per week'; 3) The current age of the patient (10), which establishes the 2-year history; 4) The symptom of chest tightness; 5) The nuance that wheezing episodes are more frequent than actual bronchodilator use; 6) The specific duration of the current exacerbation (2 weeks).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. Every claim is supported by a direct quote and a corresponding speaker tag (e.g., [P-1], [P-15]). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and follows the requested structure (Initial Diagnosis, Baseline, Current Exacerbation, Triggers). However, by omitting the specific quantitative metrics mentioned in the prompt, it provides a less focused response than the Gold Answer."
