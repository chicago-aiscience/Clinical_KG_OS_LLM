  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and correctly states that testing was negative, consistent with the transcript (patient: “I have had the covid test and I don't have it”). A minor factual issue is the statement that the cough “has worsened into a dry cough”; the transcript indicates the cough transitioned from initially productive to dry, while intensity/frequency were “kind of the same” and “No” increase in frequency. This is a small overstatement but does not change the core clinical conclusion.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: COVID-19 was investigated; prompting factors included hospital employment/occupational context, viral/flu-like symptoms with persistent cough, and coworker concern; testing was negative. Key points missing: the timing of the test (performed at symptom onset ~2 weeks ago) and that the patient stayed home afterward awaiting symptom resolution; also the Gold Answer notes PPE use/being careful as contextual detail. Overall coverage is strong but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript (hospital worker, flu-like symptoms resolving except cough, coworker fear, negative COVID test). The only mildly ungrounded element is the implication of “worsened,” which is not supported (symptoms changed character rather than worsening). Otherwise, no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers all parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated, what evidence prompted it, and what testing revealed, with minimal extraneous content."

  "summary": "Accurately identifies COVID-19 evaluation and negative testing with largely transcript-grounded rationale, but misses some contextual details (test timing/staying home) and slightly overstates symptom worsening."
