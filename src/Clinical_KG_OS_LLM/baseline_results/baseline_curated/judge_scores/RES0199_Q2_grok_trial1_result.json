  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies Tylenol as the home medication for headache relief, matching Gold [P-3,P-4], though it incorrectly cites [P-5] (location only) instead; doctor's recommendations for hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever and aches are correct per [D-52], but it omits NSAIDs option, COVID test, isolation, and patient's self-hydration, with no major contradictions but minor discrepancies in completeness of meds.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: Tylenol for headache (yes), supportive hydration/nutrition/sleep (yes), Tylenol for fever/aches (partial, misses NSAIDs); missed: patient's self-hydration [P-30], explicit 'no prescriptions', COVID swab and 14-day isolation [D-52]; covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript (Tylenol relief [P-3/P-4], location [P-5], doctor's plan [D-52]); minor citation inaccuracy for Tylenol relief and specifying only Tylenol as analgesic (doctor includes NSAIDs), but no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to question with sections on patient's medication/symptom and doctor's plan; includes minor relevant detail (headache location); no irrelevant content."
