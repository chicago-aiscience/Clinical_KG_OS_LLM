  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly claims the patient experienced a loss of smell. The transcript [P-19] and the Gold Answer both explicitly state the patient had a reduced sense of taste but NO loss of smell. This inversion of a key clinical finding is a significant factual error.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer omits several critical details present in the Gold Answer, such as the generalized muscle aches and fatigue starting after the sore throat, the specific durations of the symptoms (4 days for sore throat, 2 days for taste), and the context of potential exposure at grocery stores/banks.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a major hallucination regarding the loss of smell, stating the patient 'admitted to loss of smell (rather than retention),' which directly contradicts the transcript. Additionally, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' that was not provided in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asked how the presence of reduced taste *without* loss of smell supported the reasoning. The generated answer failed to address this specific logic, instead providing reasoning based on the false claim that the patient *did* lose their sense of smell."
