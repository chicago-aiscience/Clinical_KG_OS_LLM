  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the respiratory condition considered and ruled out. It accurately cites the key clinical findings (shortness of breath and wheezing) and correctly notes these are absent even during physical activity. However, it contains a minor error by referencing [P-13] for family history when the correct citation is [P-28]. The core facts are correct despite this citation error.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main key points: asthma as the condition, family history in grandparents, the two primary symptoms (shortness of breath and wheezing), and the physical activity context. However, it misses some details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the doctor's acknowledgment of 'asthma in the family' [D-30], (2) the meaning of 'worked up for that' as prior clinical evaluation with negative results, (3) the mother's definitive conclusion 'he doesn't have that', and (4) the contextual detail about the patient being 'pretty healthy otherwise' [P-24]. Covers approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is largely grounded in the transcript. The main clinical findings (no shortness of breath, no wheezing, even with physical activity) are directly verifiable at [P-28]. The reference to the patient having been 'worked up' for asthma is also accurate [P-28]. However, the citation [P-13] is incorrect - this exchange discusses fevers, not family history. The correct citation for family history should be [P-28]. This is a citation error but the content itself is verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly focused and directly addresses all components of the question: it identifies the respiratory condition (asthma), mentions the family history context (grandparents), and specifies the clinical findings used to rule it out (no shortness of breath, no wheezing, even during physical activity). No irrelevant information is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the ruled-out condition and accurately reports the key clinical findings (no shortness of breath, no wheezing during physical activity) cited by the mother. However, it contains a citation error ([P-13] instead of [P-28]) and omits several contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including the doctor's acknowledgment, explanation of 'worked up,' and the patient's overall health history. Despite these limitations, the core clinical information is accurate and directly addresses the question."
