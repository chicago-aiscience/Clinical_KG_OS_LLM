  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the information provided in both the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test, the 24-48 hour window for results, the 14-day isolation period, and the specific recommendation to isolate from the younger sister.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer specifically addresses the items listed in the 'including' clause of the question (diagnostic tests, isolation duration, and household contact). However, it misses other management measures included in the gold answer, most notably the 'return-to-care' or safety-netting precautions (taking the child to the ER for high fever, neurological symptoms, or fainting) and the discussion regarding the possibility of false negatives/other viral illnesses.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically from block [D-44]. There is no hallucinated information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and focuses directly on the components asked in the prompt without including extraneous information about the child's history or symptoms that weren't part of the management recommendations."
