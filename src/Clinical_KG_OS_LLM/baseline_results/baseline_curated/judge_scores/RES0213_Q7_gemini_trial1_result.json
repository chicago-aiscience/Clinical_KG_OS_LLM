  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses several critical facts from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the age the patient started smoking (18), the specific smoking history (10 cigarettes/day for two years), the eight-year gap in anxiety symptoms, and the father's heart attack, which is the primary source of the patient's cardiac concern. Additionally, it incorrectly states that the transcript 'does not specify the exact duration of onset' for the chest pain, whereas both the prompt and transcript [P-2] explicitly state it has been a 'week and a half.'",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover approximately 50% of the key points in the Gold Answer. It omits the early timeline (age 18), the duration of heavy smoking, the reduction period, the specific gap in anxiety history, and the father's health history. It focuses primarily on current symptoms and general stress.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates references to a 'Knowledge Graph' and specific graph-based logical relations (e.g., [SYMPTOM] stress --[CAUSES]--> [SYMPTOM] chest pain) that are not present in the source transcript. These are technical hallucinations rather than grounded clinical observations from the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to follow the specific instruction to trace the timeline 'starting from when she began smoking.' Instead, it starts with the current lifestyle context. It also misses the father's heart attack, which is a key phase in the timeline connecting the patient's stress to her physical symptoms of chest pain."
