  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s plan in the transcript: planned chest-focused physical exam, ordered chest X-ray and COVID swab, advised self-isolation from everyone including wife if discharged, gave a 24–48 hour results timeline, and stated admission vs discharge would depend on results. The only notable minor issue is the mention of a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the source transcript (though it doesn’t change the clinical content).",
    "completeness": "Key elements from the Gold Answer covered: (1) physical exam planned (chest-focused), (2) diagnostic tests ordered (CXR + COVID swab), (3) self-isolation instructions including staying away from wife, (4) results timeline 24–48 hours, (5) disposition dependent on results. Missed item: the Gold Answer includes that if the COVID result is positive, a public health nurse would contact the patient and tell them what to do next; the Generated Answer does not mention the public health nurse instruction.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by D-37/D-38 (exam, tests, isolation, timeline, disposition criteria). However, referencing a “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript and is an extraneous, unverifiable element. Otherwise, no major hallucinated clinical details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested management plan elements (tests, exam, isolation instructions and source, results timeline, and admit vs discharge criteria). The brief ‘clinical impression’ section is slightly beyond what was asked but still related and does not distract materially."
