    "correctness": "Step-by-step: The Gold Answer accurately cites transcript exchanges [D-7/P-7 fever denied, D-8/P-8 runny nose denied, D-10/P-10 sick contacts denied, D-11/P-11 travel denied, D-13/P-13 rashes denied, D-31/P-31 phlegm denied] and explains screening for infectious/URI/contagious/systemic conditions. Generated Answer falsely claims these questions were not asked, directly contradicting the transcript and Gold Answer; it then shifts to unrelated synthesis on asthma/bronchitis without addressing screenings. Major factual errors throughout.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: specific questions/citations, purposes (e.g., fever for pneumonia/bronchitis, runny nose for URI, etc.), negative responses, narrowing to reactive airway disease. Generated covers 0% of these, instead listing symptoms/history irrelevant to the question's focus on those screenings.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates that key questions (fever [D-7], runny nose [D-8], etc.) are absent from transcript, despite verbatim presence; references non-existent 'knowledge graph'; other claims like focus on asthma not verifiable as primary screening intent. Largely ungrounded and fabricated.",
    "relevance": "Question asks specifically about conditions screened via listed questions (fever etc.) and responses narrowing differential; Generated denies questions exist and pivots to symptoms/asthma, completely missing the target."
