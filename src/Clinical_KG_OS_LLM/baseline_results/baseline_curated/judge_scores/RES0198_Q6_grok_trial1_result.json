  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the diagnosis ('viral infection like the common cold'), supportive care (hydration and OTC Tylenol Cold), diagnostic swab with timing, and public health isolation instructions. Minor phrasing like 'specifically the common cold' and 'to rule out COVID-19' are consistent and not erroneous.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnosis ✓, supportive care (hydration, OTC meds) ✓, diagnostic test details ✓, public health guidance ✓. Missed: explicit mention of symptom duration ('a few weeks to fully resolve') and 'not much beyond supportive care' expectation-setting.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-39] of transcript with accurate citations. No hallucinations; inferences like 'rule out COVID-19' and 'immediately' (for 'today') are grounded and plausible.",
    "relevance": "Answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question's required elements (diagnosis, supportive care, test, public health), with no off-topic content."
