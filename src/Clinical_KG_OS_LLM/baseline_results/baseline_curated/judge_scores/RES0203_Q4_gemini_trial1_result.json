  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several major factual errors regarding the patient's responses. It claims the patient did not explicitly deny difficulty breathing (P-11), sore throat (P-13), chills/night sweats (P-14), and muscle aches (P-15), stating they were 'implied' or 'likely absent.' However, the transcript shows the patient explicitly said 'No' to each of these. It correctly identifies the absence of fever, headache, chest pain, and chronic conditions.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several negative findings present in the Gold Answer: the absence of sputum or blood with the cough (P-7), the absence of environmental/cold triggers for the cough (P-21), and the denial of medications (P-24), prior surgeries/hospitalizations (P-25), and family history of respiratory/cardiac disease (P-27). It covers approximately 60% of the key clinical negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails faithfulness by hallucinating that certain information is missing from the transcript. It explicitly states that the patient did not provide direct answers for dyspnea and sore throat, which is contradicted by the clear 'No' responses in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing both the list of negative findings and the explanation of clinical significance. The clinical reasoning provided (triaging respiratory distress and rule-out of systemic toxicity) is sound and addresses the prompt's requirements well, despite being based on flawed data extraction."
