  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts provided in the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID swab, the 24-48 hour window, the 14-day isolation, the possibility of false negatives, the alternative of 'another viral illness', and the specific ER warning signs (high temperature, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting). It also correctly notes the differentiation from asthma due to the presence of fever.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers almost all key points. It misses the specific detail from the Gold Answer about isolating 'from his younger sister if possible' and does not explicitly state that 'no medications were prescribed,' which was part of the Gold Answer's concluding summary. However, it addresses all components of the multi-part question effectively.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript citations ([D-44], [D-45]). There is no hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly focused on the question, providing the assessment, management plan, test details, isolation requirements, alternatives, and warning signs without irrelevant information."
