  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures exposure history (hiking and gardening), tick attachment duration (>72 hours), and prior history (tick bite with bullseye rash requiring antibiotics), matching the Gold Answer. However, it misrepresents the geographic risk assessment by attributing it to the doctor's general description of the deer tick as the vector [D-5] rather than the specific evaluation of Strathroy as a 'concerning point' via the Ontario Lyme map [D-13, P-12], introducing a factual discrepancy on a key element.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: exposure history (hiking Fri/gardening Sat [P-1]), duration (>72h [D-6]), prior history (bullseye rash/abx [P-3]). Missed or incomplete: specific geographic details (Strathroy creek [P-12], map assessment 'concerning' [D-13]), uncertainty of attachment timing, patient's comment on all ticks as carriers [P-5], sending tick to lab [D-6]. Covers ~70% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims are grounded in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [D-6], [P-1], [P-3], [D-5]). Minor interpretation in geographic section ('creating a risk profile even if...') is plausible from context but not verbatim; reference to 'knowledge graph' is unverifiable as none provided. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the four specified factors (exposure, duration, geo risk, prior history) and noting the 'despite' conditions (no rash, not deer tick), with no off-topic content."
