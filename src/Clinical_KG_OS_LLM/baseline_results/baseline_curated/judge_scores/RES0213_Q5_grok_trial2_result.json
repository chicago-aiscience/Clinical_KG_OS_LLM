  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer regarding the father's heart attack in his 50s scaring the patient [P-8], smoking history and quit attempts being hard [P-13, P-14, P-18], and psychosocial stressors like school/thesis pressure [P-15, P-16] contributing to anxiety [P-19]. Minor discrepancies include incorrectly stating the transcript 'does not confirm current active smoking' (patient reports smoking ~5/day [P-14]), omitting father's ongoing heart doctors [P-30] and grandfather's death [P-30], and adding unsubstantiated 'diagnosis' references, but main points align without major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: family history (father's HA in 50s, scares her [P-8]); smoking (trying to quit, hard [P-13]); stressors (academic stress, anxiety symptoms [P-13, P-15, P-19, P-29]); interactions (stress mimicking heart symptoms, worry due to family [P-8, P-19]). Missed: father's current 'heart doctors' [P-30], grandfather accident [P-30], specific thesis deadline/living alone/nervous running [P-15, P-16, P-26-28], detailed smoking timeline (18 start, 10/day prior). Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like father's history [P-8], stress triggers [P-29], breathing faster from nerves [P-19] are verifiable. Hallucinations include 'knowledge graph' mentions (twice, not in transcript), 'heart disease concern diagnosis explicitly indicated' (fabricated), and 'transcript does not confirm current active smoking' (contradicts P-14). Interpretations like cycle of anxiety are plausible but some unverifiable elements present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around the three specified factors (family, smoking, stressors), their contributions/interactions with heart disease concern, and transcript illustrations with citations, perfectly matching the question without off-topic content."
