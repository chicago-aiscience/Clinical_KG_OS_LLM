  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately cites triggers from P-9 and P-11, notes no other triggers (P-10), details clinician's suspicion of allergies via dialogue (D-12, P-12, D-13, D-31), family history specifics (P-32-34), links to exacerbation via precise inhaler use increase (P-8), and clinician's medication suggestion (D-43). Generated correctly identifies triggers and citations, family history, and general exacerbation/increased use, but inaccurately introduces non-existent 'knowledge graph' twice, vaguely attributes allergy suspicion to pollen without clinician details, omits no other triggers/family details, and misses specific inhaler frequency and clinician plan; some factual errors but core relations present.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: three triggers with cites (covered), no other triggers (missed), clinician allergy dialogue and agreement (partially covered via pollen link), allergy revisit/no others (missed), sister asthma/no other family issues (partially, only sister), exacerbation via specific inhaler escalation (partially, general increase), clinician med change suggestion (missed). Covers triggers, family asthma, basic exacerbation/allergy links (~60-70%), misses specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like triggers, symptoms, family history verifiable with accurate citations [P-9, P-11, P-32, etc.]; however, 'knowledge graph explicitly links pollen to allergies' and 'family history indicates likelihood per knowledge graph' are wholly fabricated—not in transcript; minor interpretive additions like 'uncontrolled and warrants attention' plausible but extra; multiple hallucinations lower score.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on how three triggers + sister asthma relate to exacerbation and doctor's allergy suspicion; Generated directly structures response around exacerbation symptoms, triggers' roles, explicit allergy suspicion link via pollen, family history, and summary tying them—highly focused, no off-topic content."
