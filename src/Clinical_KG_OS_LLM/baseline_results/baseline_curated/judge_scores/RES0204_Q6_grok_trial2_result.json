  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details the full initial plan from [D-1] (chat, exam lungs/heart, consult supervising physician, return with plan), specific tentative nature of chest X-ray ('might want'), COVID swab as standard, age-appropriate explanations, explicit follow-up to arrange tests and return together to discuss next steps, patient agreement, and thanks. Generated Answer accurately covers consultation, both tests with citations, explanations/reassurance, and health goal, but minor discrepancies include overstating chest X-ray as definitive 'will proceed' vs 'might,' misattributing consultation goal to internal chest view (that's for X-ray), omitting physical exam of lungs/heart, and not detailing full return-with-plan follow-up structure.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: consultation [D-37], chest X-ray [D-37/39], COVID swab [D-39], explanations/reassurance [D-39], goal for health [D-37]. Missed: initial plan structure including chat and lung/heart exam [D-1], tentative X-ray phrasing and supervising doc's role, explicit follow-up to arrange tests and return together [D-40], patient/mom agreement [P-40], concluding thanks [D-41/42]. Covers ~70% of key points, focusing on tests/consult but incomplete on full plan sequence and follow-up details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: consultation phrasing [D-37], tests and descriptions [D-37/39], reassurance/bravery [D-39], health goal [D-37]. Minor issues: 'arranged' and 'will proceed' slightly stronger than tentative 'wondering/arrange' phrasing; consultation goal tied to chest view is plausible inference but directly precedes X-ray mention. Citations accurate, no fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by structuring response around consultation, diagnostic tests, and communicated elements like explanations/goal; directly describes plan components without off-topic content."
