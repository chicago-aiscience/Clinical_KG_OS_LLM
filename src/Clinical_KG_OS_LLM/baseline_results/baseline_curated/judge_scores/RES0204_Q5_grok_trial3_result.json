  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes the doctor's direct inquiry about family history of respiratory problems [D-28], with mom responding about grandparents' asthma [P-28] and doctor summarizing [D-30]. Generated Answer inaccurately implies the patient voluntarily brings up the asthma history 'in response to the clinical evaluation,' citing earlier unrelated questions like sore throat [D-9] and taste/smell [D-10], missing the specific family respiratory history question. For differentiation, Generated correctly captures the absence of shortness of breath and wheezing even with activity [P-28] but omits Gold's details on current dry cough, clear runny nose, and prior episode differences. Some factual errors but main points (family asthma, differentiation via absent symptoms) are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold: doctor's specific inquiry [D-28]; mom's disclosure and differentiation [P-28]; doctor's summary [D-30]; prior workup negative; no SOB/wheezing with activity; current dry non-productive cough [D-5/6]; clear runny nose [D-11/12]; no wheeze/dyspnea; prior issues shorter/not dry [P-24]. Generated covers: grandparents asthma [P-28]; worked up negative, no SOB/wheezing/activity issues [P-28]. Misses doctor's inquiry/summary, current symptom details, prior history contrast. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are verifiable: sore throat inquiry [D-9], taste/smell [D-10], grandparents asthma and differentiation details [P-28]. Citations accurate. Minor issue: attributes statements to 'patient' but [P-28] is mom's speech (labeled P); no hallucinations, fully grounded with plausible speaker interpretation.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both question parts: connection of family asthma to inquiry (though inaccurately), and differentiation via symptom profile/absence of SOB/wheezing. Minor tangent on earlier symptoms questions for context, but focused overall."
