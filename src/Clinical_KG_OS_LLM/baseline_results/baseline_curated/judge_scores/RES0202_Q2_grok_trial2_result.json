  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts fully align with the Gold Answer and transcript: COVID-19 swab with 24-48 hour results [D-44], isolation for 14 days [D-44], and specific isolation from the younger sister [D-44]. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: COVID swab and timing (covered), isolation for 14 days from younger sister (covered), household composition noting sister (partially covered via isolation mention), ER precautions for worsening symptoms (missed), false-negative possibility and other viral illness (missed), no medications/supportive care/wait for results (missed), mother's acknowledgment and school requirement (not doctor's recs, peripheral). Covers core elements specified in the question (test, isolation details) but misses ~40% of broader management points like monitoring/ER.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-44]: swab test and timing, 14-day isolation, separation from younger sister explicitly stated. Citations accurate. No hallucinated content or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response as bullets directly matching diagnostic tests, isolation instructions/duration, and specific household member (younger sister) to isolate from. No off-topic content."
