  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the sputum description, chest pain location, and systemic symptoms without any errors.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several significant details present in the gold answer, including the 'dull' and 'constant' description of the chest pain, the specific timeline of the cough (starting Friday, worsening Sunday), the report of exertional dyspnea (feeling winded on stairs), the history of a runny nose, and the pertinent negative regarding weight loss.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All symptom reports are backed by correct patient turn citations, and it even retains the specific phrasing 'well spots are red' from the patient's dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the question, providing specific sections for systemic symptoms, chest pain, sputum description, and other respiratory symptoms as requested."
