  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the only medication used is occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications involved. These points match the Gold Answer and are supported by the transcript (P-35–P-37, P-46–P-47). No directly incorrect clinical claims are made.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) intermittent OTC Reactine/antihistamines for seasonal allergies; (2) explicitly no prescribed medications. Key points missed: (1) for the current wheezing/SOB episodes, the mother gives her nothing and episodes resolve with rest (P-33–P-34); (2) prior viral infections did not require antibiotics (P-16). Because the question explicitly asks about treatments for the current respiratory episodes as well as other conditions, omission of the “no treatment given for episodes” is a major gap.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements are grounded in the transcript: Reactine/OTC allergy meds (P-36) and no prescribed meds (P-36, P-46–P-47). No hallucinated medications or treatments are introduced. Minor wording issue: refers to the 'patient' mentioning details, though it is the parent speaking, but content remains transcript-supported.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on medications/treatments and whether any prescribed medication is part of management, which directly addresses the question. No substantial irrelevant material."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded regarding OTC Reactine use and absence of prescribed medications, but incomplete because it omits that no treatment is being given for the current wheezing episodes (and does not mention the prior lack of antibiotic use)."
