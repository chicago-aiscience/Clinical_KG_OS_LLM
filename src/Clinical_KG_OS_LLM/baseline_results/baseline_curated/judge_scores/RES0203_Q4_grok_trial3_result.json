  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: it incorrectly states that difficulty breathing/dyspnea was not explicitly denied (P-11 clearly says 'No'), sore throat denial is not explicit (P-13 'No'), and chills/night sweats/muscle aches are only 'likely absent' rather than directly denied (P-14 'No', P-15 'Uh no'); misses key negatives like no sputum/blood (D-7/P-7), no cough triggers (D-21/P-21), and the D-16 summary; includes extras like allergies not central to ROS negatives; explanation adds non-Gold elements like 'knowledge graph' and bacterial superinfections.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 9 specific ROS negatives (fever, dyspnea, headaches, sore throat, chills/night sweats, muscle aches/weakness, chest pain, sputum/blood, cough triggers) with citations, D-16 summary, explanation of absences informing non-acute illness and general wellness, plus chronic/med/surgery/allergy/family denials. Generated covers fever, headaches, chest pain, sore throat (inaccurately), chills (inacc.), muscle (inacc.), chronic; misses dyspnea explicitly, sputum/blood, triggers, D-16; partial explanation coverage; ~50-60% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple inaccuracies/hallucinations vs transcript: dyspnea explicitly denied in P-11 but claimed not; sore throat denied P-13 but called implied/not explicit; chills P-14 'No' but 'likely absent due to no fever'; muscle P-15 'Uh no' but 'likely'; infers dyspnea absence from mild cough (not verifiable); adds 'knowledge graph linking smell to COVID' not in transcript; unverifiable clinical inferences like 'secondary viral meningitis'.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists negative findings from ROS and explains clinical significance (e.g., no severe distress, differentiates COVID), addressing the question; minor off-topic additions like knowledge graph and chronic disease management tangents."
