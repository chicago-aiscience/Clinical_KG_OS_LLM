  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the persistent dry cough and chest soreness as ongoing symptoms, and groups early flu-like symptoms (including implicit sore throat and runny nose) plus mucus as resolved, matching the core of the Gold Answer. Minor discrepancies include: not specifying sore throat [P-13] and runny nose [P-14] separately (lumped as 'flu-like'), lacking mucus details (whitish clear, first 4-5 days [P-6]), omitting cough details (frequency 3-4x/hour [P-9], spontaneous [P-10], stable intensity/frequency [P-7,P-8]), not noting chest soreness nuance vs independent pain [P-15,P-16], excluding pertinent negatives (no SOB [P-11], fever [P-12], N/V [P-19], abd pain [P-20]), and adding chronic anxiety/reflux [P-22,P-25] not part of the two-week illness symptoms. Core facts are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: persistent cough lasting 2 weeks now dry [P-2,P-5,P-14]; resolved flu-like symptoms in first 2-4 days [P-14]; early mucus [P-5]; chest soreness with coughing [P-15]. Missed: sore throat specifically (first 2-3 days [P-13]); runny nose [P-14]; mucus details (whitish clear, 4-5 days [P-6]); cough frequency (3-4x/hour [P-9]), triggers (spontaneous [P-10]), stability [P-7,P-8]; chest soreness only post-coughing, no independent pain [P-16]; all pertinent negatives. Covers approximately 60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., flu-like [P-14], mucus [P-5], cough [P-2,P-5,P-14], chest [P-15], anxiety/reflux [P-22,P-25]). No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response around resolved vs. present symptoms for the two-week illness, directly addressing the question. Minor tangent in adding unrelated chronic background conditions (anxiety, reflux) under a separate section."
