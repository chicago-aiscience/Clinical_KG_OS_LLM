  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Core relationships are correct: she is worried it could be cardiac and explicitly links that fear to her father’s heart attack in his 50s; stress/anxiety can amplify symptom perception and breathing changes during episodes. However, the answer contains a clear factual misstatement: it claims the transcript does not confirm current active smoking, but the patient explicitly reports she is still smoking (cut down to ~5/day) and is “trying to quit.” It also introduces non-transcript framing such as “knowledge graph” and “heart disease concern diagnosis,” which are not part of the consultation and risk implying clinical conclusions not stated in the source.",
    "completeness": "Covers the main three domains (family history, smoking, psychosocial stress/anxiety) and gives relevant transcript examples for father’s early MI and anxiety-related breathing/trigger contexts. Missing several key Gold Answer details: (1) father now sees “a lot of heart doctors” (noted in generated answer only generally), (2) paternal grandfather history being unknown due to death from an accident, (3) specific smoking timeline/amounts (started ~18, up to ~10/day for 2 years, now ~5/day), (4) key psychosocial context—thesis end-stage/time crunch, living alone in London/limited social contact, nervous about running recently, and explicit mention that prior teenage anxiety attacks may be returning.",
    "faithfulness": "Many statements are grounded with appropriate citations (e.g., father’s MI and patient fear [P-8], stress/school workload [P-13], anxiety-related faster breathing [P-19], symptoms noticed when alone [P-29]). But it includes multiple elements not present in the transcript (“knowledge graph,” “diagnosis,” and a claim that smoking status is unconfirmed) and an inaccurate interpretation about smoking, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "Stays focused on how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with her heart-disease concern, and uses consultation details to illustrate the links. Minor tangents (knowledge-graph/diagnostic framing) detract slightly but do not derail the response."
