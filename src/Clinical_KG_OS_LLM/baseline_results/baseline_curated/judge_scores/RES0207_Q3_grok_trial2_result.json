  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer establishes the connection based solely on transcript evidence (missed Keppra dose same night as seizure due to disrupted routine [P-8, P-24], patient's recognition in P-9). Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra [P-23], seizure timing [P-8], and patient's recognition via accurate P-9 quote. Minor discrepancies: introduces unmentioned 'knowledge graph' as source of causality (not in Gold or transcript), does not specify 'same night' or daughter's birthday details, but core causal link and patient recognition are factually consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) missed Keppra connected to same-night seizure [P-8,P-24]; (2) patient recognition in P-9 (spontaneous response to D-9); (3) unprompted by adherence Q; (4) seizures usually rare [P-9]; (5) P-24 birthday explanation; (6) no clinician confirmation. Generated covers: connection/missed dose to seizure, Keppra name, P-9 recognition quote. Misses: timing specificity, birthday context [P-24], rarity of seizures, unprompted nature, no clinician input. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: Keppra [P-23], seizure [P-8], P-9 quote exact and attributed correctly. 'Missed dose is direct cause' inferred from patient but phrased as fact 'according to knowledge graph' (no graph in transcript, unverifiable/hallucinated external reference). Other details grounded; minor hallucination but mostly verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Directly explains causal connection (missed dose to seizure) and patient's recognition (P-9 evidence), perfectly matching question; knowledge graph mention is minor extraneous but does not detract from focus."
