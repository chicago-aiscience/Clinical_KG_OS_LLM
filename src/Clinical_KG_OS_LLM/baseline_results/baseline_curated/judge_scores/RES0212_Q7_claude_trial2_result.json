  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key temporal milestones from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: (1) three months ago as initial onset, (2) one month ago for nightly sleep disruption, (3) three days ago for productive greenish sputum, and (4) past couple days for subjective fevers. All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript citations.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all four key temporal points requested in the question. It includes initial onset, sleep disruption timing, productive cough with greenish sputum, and subjective fever development. However, it lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the pole dancing class context, the intermittent nature description ('sometimes there, sometimes goes away'), the 'acute-on-chronic' characterization, and the doctor's closing summary reference. Covers approximately 85% of Gold Answer content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer uses proper bracketed references [P-2], [P-19], [P-9], [P-4], [D-47] that correspond to actual transcript statements. No hallucinated information is present. The answer appropriately grounds its timeline in patient statements and doctor confirmations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and systematically addresses the question's request to trace the complete timeline. It organizes information chronologically with clear numbered sections matching the four temporal milestones asked about: initial onset, sleep disruption, productive cough, and fevers. No irrelevant information is included, and the structure perfectly mirrors the question's requirements."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-structured timeline that correctly identifies all four temporal milestones requested. It demonstrates strong factual accuracy with proper transcript citations and maintains perfect relevance to the question. The only minor limitation is slightly less contextual detail compared to the Gold Answer, such as omitting the pole dancing class setting and the 'acute-on-chronic' clinical characterization, which prevents a perfect completeness score."
