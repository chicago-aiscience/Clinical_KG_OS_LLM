  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the COVID-19 swab test with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation, and specific isolation from the younger sister, all directly matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-44] with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered from Gold Answer: COVID swab test with 24-48 hours results; isolation for 14 days; specific isolation from younger sister. Key points missed: full household composition (parents and sister [P-35]); ER precautions (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting spells); possibility of false negatives and other viral illness; no medications prescribed, supportive/observational approach; school requirement for test result; mother's acknowledgment of supportive care for viruses. Covers approximately 40-50% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer (COVID swab, 24-48 hours, 14-day isolation due to compatible symptoms, separation from younger sister) are directly verifiable in the transcript [D-44] with accurate citations; minor paraphrase of 'aligned/allowed with' to 'compatible' is grounded and not hallucinatory.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer uses bullet points to directly and concisely address the exact elements of the question (diagnostic tests, isolation instructions/duration, specific household member to isolate from) with no off-topic content."
