  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key present symptoms of chest tightness with inspiration/exertion and difficulty getting a full breath (dyspnea) consistent with [P-1] and [P-7]. However, it incorrectly states that the only explicitly denied symptom was chest pain. In the transcript the patient explicitly denies multiple screened symptoms: anxiety/sweating/impending doom [P-6], cough [P-11], fevers [P-12], night sweats [P-13], chills [P-14], and weight loss [P-15]. It also incorrectly claims these were “not mentioned,” which directly contradicts the transcript. It omits the upper-airway symptoms (hoarseness, phlegm, throat clearing) that were present [P-11]. The inclusion of “seasonal allergies (history)” is not asked for and does not answer the symptom question for this visit.",
    "completeness": "Present symptoms: partially covered (chest tightness and dyspnea), but misses important descriptors (diffuse/all over; worse with deep breath/getting up from chair) and misses upper-airway complaints (hoarseness, phlegm, throat clearing). Denials: largely missed—fails to list explicit denials of fever, night sweats, chills, weight loss, cough, anxiety, and sweating/impending doom. Overall covers well under 50% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or are contradicted by the transcript: claiming fever/chills/night sweats/weight loss/cough were not mentioned, and claiming cough was not explicitly denied. These are explicit Q&A items in [D-11]–[D-15] with patient denials. Also, the “knowledge graph” framing is not part of the transcript. While some symptom descriptions are grounded, there are multiple clear transcript-inconsistent claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally aimed at symptoms present and denied, which is the question asked, but it adds an irrelevant historical item (seasonal allergies) and spends space on clinician interpretation. The main relevance problem is that it fails to provide most of the requested denied symptoms, but it is still broadly on the same topic rather than off-topic."
