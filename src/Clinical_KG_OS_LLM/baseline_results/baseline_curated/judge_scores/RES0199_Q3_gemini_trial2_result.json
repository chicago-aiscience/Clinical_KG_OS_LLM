  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the primary condition (COVID-19) and the characteristic symptom (loss of smell). However, it omits the gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and fatigue that the doctor systematically gathered and were included in the Gold Answer as part of the symptom constellation.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. It focuses only on headache, cough, and loss of smell, providing a less comprehensive overview of the symptoms the doctor considered.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are well-grounded in the transcript with correct citations. However, the answer references a 'knowledge graph,' which is not present in the provided source material and represents a minor hallucination regarding the source of information.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on the two-part question without unnecessary tangents."
