  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 and the 'covid test'. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly state the timing of the test relative to symptom onset. Transcript [P-36] explicitly says, 'I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.'",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to provide the timing of the test (which was explicitly asked), misses the patient's specific role as a clerk, and omits the details about the patient staying home and their eagerness to return to work without a cough.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is mostly grounded, but it makes a false claim about the absence of information (the timing) that is clearly present in the transcript at [P-36].",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, although it provides an incorrect/incomplete response to the 'when' and 'workplace concerns' portions."
