  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all factual elements from the Gold Answer: COVID-19 as the condition (with citations to P-1 and D-39 matching), COVID swab test ordered today (D-39), 48-hour turnaround (D-39), and isolation instructions while awaiting results (D-39). Minor phrasing differences exist (e.g., 'covid swab' vs. 'COVID \"swab\"'), but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: condition (COVID-19 by both, P-1/D-39), test (swab, D-39), turnaround (48 hours, D-39), main instructions (isolation at home, D-39). Missed: explicit mention of 'further instructions from public health' after results and minor contextual notes on pandemic/symptom overlap. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: patient's concern [P-1], doctor's statements on pandemic/COVID symptoms/swab/48 hours/isolation [D-39]. Paraphrases are accurate (e.g., 'considered and excluded via a test' reflects D-39 intent); citations precise; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer uses bullet points to directly and comprehensively address each of the four question components (condition, test, turnaround, instructions) without any off-topic content or tangents."
