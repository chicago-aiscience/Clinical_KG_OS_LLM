  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main nasal complaints as congestion (“stuffy nose”) and rhinorrhea for ~1 week (consistent with Gold/Transcript: P-1, P-2, P-3). However, it contains major factual errors: it states the discharge character is not described, but the patient explicitly said it was “mostly clear” (P-5). It also states the patient did not explicitly deny sore throat, cough, post-nasal drip, or loss of taste/smell, but the transcript clearly includes denials of cough (P-4), back-of-throat drainage/post-nasal drip (P-6), sore throat (P-7), and loss of taste/smell (P-16). These are central to the question and Gold Answer, making the overall response significantly inaccurate.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: nasal congestion/stuffy nose and runny nose for ~1 week. Key elements missed: evolution from initially stuffy to mostly running (P-3); discharge described as mostly clear (P-5); explicit denials of cough (P-4), post-nasal drip/back-of-throat drainage (P-6), sore throat/SOB/fever/chills (P-7), and loss of taste/smell (P-16). The question specifically asks for these denied symptoms and discharge character, which are omitted/incorrectly negated. Overall coverage is well under half of required key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Although the answer cites the transcript, several statements are not grounded and directly contradict the transcript (e.g., claiming no discharge description despite P-5; claiming no explicit denials despite P-4, P-6, P-7, P-16). This is a substantial faithfulness issue (misrepresentation of available transcript evidence), even if it is not “hallucinating” new symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured around nasal symptoms, discharge, and denied associated symptoms, matching the question’s scope. However, it includes unnecessary references to unrelated transcript portions (nephew, diabetes) and incorrectly asserts absence of denials, which reduces usefulness but remains largely on-topic."
