{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath as the primary symptoms and correctly identifies wheezing as the earliest symptom and the cough as the most recent development.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the major points but misses some granular details present in the gold answer. Specifically, it does not mention that the cough was non-productive (no phlegm), it omits the mother's denial of cyanosis (turning blue), and it fails to specify that 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' was also noted as an earliest symptom along with wheezing at the 4-5 day onset mark.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims are supported by correct references to the dialogue (e.g., P-1, P-2, P-43). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question: the specific symptoms at presentation and the timeline of those symptoms."
