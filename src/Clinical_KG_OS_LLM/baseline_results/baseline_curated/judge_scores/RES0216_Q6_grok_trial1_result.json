  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment as asthma-related (phrased as 'exacerbation' vs Gold's 'reoccurring in some capacity'), physical exam (listening to lungs), initial intervention (rescue puffers on walks), and contingency (reassess if no improvement). Minor discrepancies include interpreting 'reoccurring' as 'exacerbation' (slightly stronger than transcript/Gold), claiming cardiac is 'ruled out' (Gold says 'lower'), and omitting that patient lacks current rescue puffer; core facts align.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: assessment as top differential (yes), phys exam incl. lung auscultation (yes), initial rescue puffer trial (yes), contingency to reassess/explore alternatives (yes), stepwise approach (implied). Missed/partial: explicit 'pending exam/findings' nuance, patient currently lacks rescue [P-17/18], consult with supervising doc [D-35/37]. Covers ~85-90% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: assessment [D-35], phys exam [D-35], intervention [D-35], contingency [D-35/36], history notes [P-16/25]. 'Exacerbation' and 'acute flare-up' are plausible interpretations of 'reoccurring' given context/symptoms but not verbatim; no fabrication, minor interpretive additions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured and focused on question components (assessment, phys exam, first-step treatment, contingency); no off-topic content."
