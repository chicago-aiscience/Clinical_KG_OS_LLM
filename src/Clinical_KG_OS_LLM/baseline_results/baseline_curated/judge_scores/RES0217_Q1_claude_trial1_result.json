  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding fever screening. The transcript clearly shows the doctor asking 'Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?' [D-8] and the patient responding 'No, no, I've been fine' [P-8], yet the Generated Answer incorrectly states 'the provided transcript does not contain an explicit denial of fever from the patient.' Additionally, the Generated Answer incorrectly interprets [P-1] as a denial of joint pain when the doctor's specific screening for joint pain occurs later at [D-7]/[P-7]. The local symptoms are accurately reported with correct citations.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses important systemic screening denials. It correctly identifies the three local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) with proper citations. However, it fails to accurately report the fever denial and provides an incomplete characterization of the joint pain screening. The Gold Answer explicitly mentions the patient denied joint pain [P-7], feeling ill/feverish [P-8], and headaches [P-19, P-20], while the Generated Answer incorrectly claims no explicit fever denial exists and mischaracterizes the joint pain denial.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer shows moderate faithfulness issues. While the local symptom descriptions are well-grounded with accurate citations [P-1, P-6], the Generated Answer contains a significant error by claiming the transcript does not contain an explicit fever denial when it clearly does at [P-8]. The misinterpretation of [P-1] as the joint pain denial rather than [P-7] also represents a grounding issue. The headache denial citation is incorrect ([P-6] instead of [P-19, P-20]).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: local symptoms at the bite site and systemic symptoms screened. The organization is clear with separate sections for local and systemic symptoms. However, the incorrect analysis of fever screening and mischaracterization of joint pain responses detract from overall relevance, as these errors affect the accuracy of answering what the patient actually denied."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies and cites the three local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) at the tick bite site. However, it contains a critical factual error by incorrectly stating that the transcript does not contain an explicit fever denial, when the patient clearly states 'No, no, I've been fine' [P-8] in response to the doctor's fever screening [D-8]. The answer also mischaracterizes the joint pain denial by citing [P-1] instead of the actual screening at [D-7]/[P-7], and provides an incorrect citation for the headache denial. While the structure and organization are good, these factual errors significantly impact the answer's correctness and completeness."
