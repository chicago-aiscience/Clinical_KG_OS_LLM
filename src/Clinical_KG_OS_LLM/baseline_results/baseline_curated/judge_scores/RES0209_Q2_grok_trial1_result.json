  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer correctly identifies the bronchodilator (rescue inhaler/puffer) as the only medication, administered via puffer, with explicit denial of other meds and specific doctor inquiry (D-5) about a daily 'every day no matter what' controller med that patient lacks (P-5). Generated Answer correctly names bronchodilator puffer but uses incorrect evidence (P-1 only, ignores D-4/P-4/D-6 etc.); crucially contradicts by claiming 'transcript does not contain a specific dialogue where the doctor asks about a daily controller medication,' which directly opposes Gold's citation of D-5; also fabricates 'Knowledge Graph.' Significant contradictions on key doctor question and evidence.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: sole med bronchodilator rescue/as-needed (D-4,P-4,D-6), puffer (D-7,P-7), no others (P-6,P-30), doctor asked about daily controller 'every day no matter what' (D-5), patient lacks it (P-5). Generated covers bronchodilator puffer and lack of daily controller but misses as-needed detail, explicit denials of other meds, and entirely botches the specific doctor question (denies it exists); covers ~30-40% accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated verifiable on bronchodilator (P-1) and puffer (but cites hallucinated 'Knowledge Graph,' not transcript D-7/P-7); daily controller claim ungrounded—cites irrelevant P-12 (allergies) and P-1, explicitly denies existing dialogue (D-5 present), infers without basis from 'lack of formal diagnosis' (asthma diagnosed P-2); multiple hallucinations including Knowledge Graph and false absence of dialogue.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response directly matching question's three parts (medication, administration, daily controller), with no off-topic tangents, though content erroneous; perfectly focused on query."
