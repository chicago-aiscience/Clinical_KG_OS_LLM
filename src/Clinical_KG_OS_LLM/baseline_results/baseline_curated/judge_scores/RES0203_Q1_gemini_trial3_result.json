  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly categorizes the loss of taste as 'complete'. According to the transcript [P-4] and the Gold Answer, the loss was partial because the patient could still taste 'really, really salty foods'. It also overlooks the duration (2 days) and the specific nature of the cough (dry/non-productive) mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details required by the prompt and present in the Gold Answer: it does not mention the duration of symptoms, the specific ability to smell 'really bad' odors, the ability to taste salty foods vs. the inability to taste bananas, the consistency of the symptoms, the lack of sputum/blood in the cough, and the absence of triggers.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer limits itself to the patient's opening statement [P-1]. While it accurately quotes that specific turn, it ignores subsequent turns (specifically [P-4]) where the patient clarifies that the senses are not totally gone, leading to a hallucination of 'complete' taste loss.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the general categories of symptoms but fails to follow the prompt's specific instruction to 'Include any details the patient provided about what they could and could not still perceive'. By ignoring these details, it only partially addresses the user's request."
