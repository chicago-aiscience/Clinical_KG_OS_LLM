  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. The diagnosis is correctly stated as 'most likely a viral infection like the common cold.' Supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold) are accurate. The diagnostic test (COVID swab with 48-hour results) is correctly described. Public health guidance (isolation until results, further instructions from public health) is accurately conveyed. The only minor difference is formatting and slightly different wording, but no factual errors exist.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the working diagnosis of viral infection/common cold, (2) both supportive care recommendations (hydration and OTC medications), (3) the diagnostic test details (COVID swab, performed today, 48-hour turnaround), and (4) public health guidance (isolation at home, awaiting further instructions). The Gold Answer's mention of symptoms taking 'a few weeks' to resolve is not explicitly stated in the Generated Answer, representing a minor omission of context, but all core management plan elements are present.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in [D-39]. The diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance are all explicitly stated by the doctor in that exchange. No hallucinated information is present. The citations [D-39] are accurate and appropriate. The formatting and organization enhance clarity without adding unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly focused on the question asked. It directly addresses the complete management plan including diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic testing, and public health guidance as communicated at the end of the visit. No irrelevant information is included. The structured format with clear headings makes the response highly relevant and easy to follow."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent response that is highly accurate, well-grounded in the transcript, and directly addresses all components of the question. It correctly identifies the diagnosis, supportive care measures, diagnostic testing, and public health guidance from [D-39]. The only minor limitation is the omission of the doctor's statement about symptoms taking 'a few weeks' to resolve, which provides helpful context about expectations. Otherwise, the answer is comprehensive, factually correct, and well-organized."
