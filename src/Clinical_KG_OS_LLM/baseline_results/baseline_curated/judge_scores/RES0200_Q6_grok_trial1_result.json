  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript. Labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab), imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (O2 saturation and supplemental O2 if needed), and therapeutics (steroids, antibiotics as new; bronchodilators continued, naming Ventolin/Spiriva from transcript) match precisely. Minor omission of BP monitoring from [D-37] (noted as 'additionally' in Gold) and result timing, but no contradictions or errors in core COPD plan.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold fully covered: all listed labs, imaging, monitoring (O2 sat/supplemental O2), therapeutics (steroids, antibiotics, bronchodilators continuation, supplemental O2). Names specific bronchodilators (grounded in [P-11]). Omits minor details like result timing (24-48 hrs) and BP monitoring (additional, not core to [D-52] COPD plan), covering ~95-99%.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] with accurate citations. Bronchodilator names from [P-11], doctor's reference to 'your bronchodilators'. No unverifiable or hallucinated content; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by structuring response into exact categories (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics with new/continued distinction), focusing solely on doctor's COPD exacerbation plan from [D-52] without off-topic content."
