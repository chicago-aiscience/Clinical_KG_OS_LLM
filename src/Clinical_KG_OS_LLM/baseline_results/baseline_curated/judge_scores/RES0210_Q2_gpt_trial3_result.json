  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states the patient is taking Lipitor (atorvastatin) for high cholesterol and also took OTC Tylenol (acetaminophen) for febrile/unwell symptoms, reporting it “helps a little bit.” The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for high cholesterol, but incorrectly states there were no OTC medications mentioned and therefore no effectiveness could be assessed. This directly contradicts the transcript at [P-14] (“I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit.”). The reference to a “knowledge graph” is not part of the transcript and is unnecessary/unverifiable.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer: (1) Lipitor prescribed for high cholesterol; (2) patient confirmed it is the only prescription med; (3) OTC Tylenol taken for symptom relief; (4) Tylenol provided partial relief (“helps a little bit”); (5) no other meds mentioned; (6) non-medication measure: expectorating sputum helps briefly. Generated Answer covers only (1) partially, and omits/gets wrong (2)-(6), especially missing Tylenol and its reported limited effectiveness.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that no OTC medications were mentioned is not grounded in the transcript and is contradicted by [P-14]. The “knowledge graph data” justification is also not in the provided source. Aside from Lipitor, multiple statements are unsupported or incorrect relative to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address prescribed and OTC medications, indications, and OTC effectiveness, which is aligned with the question. However, it fails to identify the OTC medication actually reported and therefore does not truly answer the OTC portion."
