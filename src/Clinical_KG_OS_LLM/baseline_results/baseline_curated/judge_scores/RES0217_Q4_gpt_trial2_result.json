  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most elements match the Gold Answer: erythema migrans/bullseye rash was assessed and absent; joint pain, fever/illness, and headaches were screened for; proposed tests included physical exam, tick speciation at a lab, and bloodwork for titres/serology. Minor issue: the Generated Answer adds “Ixodes” terminology, which is not stated in the transcript (the transcript only says “deer tick”). This is a small extrapolation rather than a major contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points partially missed/understated:\n- The question asks for features assessed and found absent; the Generated Answer lists that joint pain/fever/headaches were asked about but does not explicitly state the patient denied them (whereas Gold specifies denials).\n- It omits the doctor’s confirmation that the patient was feeling well otherwise (and patient affirmed “totally fine”).\n- It omits that the patient checked and found no other bites on herself/husband.\nDiagnostic tests proposed are essentially complete (physical exam, tick ID, serology), but the clinical-features-absent portion is not fully captured as in Gold.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all claims are grounded in the transcript, including the rash denial and the proposed testing plan. The main ungrounded detail is explicitly naming “Ixodes,” which is not said in the transcript, though it is a plausible synonym for “deer tick.” The mention of a “provided knowledge graph” is also not in the transcript but does not change clinical content.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on (1) absent clinical features of active Lyme disease that were assessed and (2) proposed diagnostic steps to evaluate/exclude Lyme disease."
