  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the smoking history (20 years, 1/2 pack/day) and the causal link to COPD. It also accurately maps the chain of events from the sick contact (dog walking) to the respiratory infection and subsequent COPD exacerbation, consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the core components of the question but misses several specific details present in the Gold Answer: the fact that she quit smoking 4-5 years ago, her use of maintenance/rescue inhalers, the 3-day timeline of the exacerbation, and secondary symptoms like sinus pressure and headache. It also omits the patient's self-recognition that her COPD is typically worsened by being sick.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source of information, which is not present in the transcript. Additionally, it states the doctor 'confirms' a respiratory infection, whereas the transcript (D-43) shows the doctor suggesting it as a 'likely' cause pending labs and vitals.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the multi-part question without unnecessary tangents."
