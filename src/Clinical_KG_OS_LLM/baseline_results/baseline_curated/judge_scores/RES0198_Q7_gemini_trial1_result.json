  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error regarding the frequency of symptoms. It states the symptoms were 'on and off' based on P-1, but the transcript shows that when specifically asked by the doctor in D-8, the patient clarified in P-8 that the symptoms have been 'pretty constant for the past week.' The Gold Answer correctly identifies this nuance, whereas the generated answer incorrectly asserts they were 'on and off' rather than constant.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses key points from the Gold Answer. Specifically, it misses the direct evidence in P-3 where the patient explicitly states the nose 'felt pretty stuffy at first' but is 'now mostly running.' Instead, the generated answer uses indirect reasoning from P-10 to infer the order. It also completely misses the patient's clarification in P-8 regarding the constant nature of the symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is partially faithful as it cites P-1 and P-10 correctly. However, it ignores P-8, which directly contradicts its claim about the symptoms being 'on and off.' By ignoring the patient's clarification in the later part of the dialogue, the answer provides a misleading clinical picture.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in that it attempts to address every part of the prompt: onset, symptom order, shift in predominance, and frequency."
