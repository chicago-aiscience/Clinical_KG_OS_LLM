  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant error, claiming the transcript does not specify the exact duration of onset for the chest pain, whereas the transcript explicitly states 'a week and a half' [P-2]. It also misses specific chronological markers found in the Gold Answer, such as starting smoking at 18 and the 8-year gap in anxiety symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key milestones requested by the prompt and present in the Gold Answer: the starting age for smoking (18), the specific quantity (10 cigarettes/day), the father's heart attack (crucial context for her fear), and the 8-year symptom-free period. It fails to 'trace the timeline' chronologically as instructed.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' (referencing it twice as a source), which is not part of the provided clinical transcript. This indicates the model is relying on internal data structures or training templates rather than the source text provided.",
    "relevance": "While the answer discusses the patient's symptoms and stress, it fails to follow the specific instruction to trace the history starting from the beginning of smoking. Instead, it starts with the current attempt to quit and lacks the chronological flow requested."
