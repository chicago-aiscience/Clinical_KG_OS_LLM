  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the doctor's plan from [D-43], including physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab, consultation with attending, and disposition criteria based on labs and vital signs. Minor discrepancies include phrasing the COVID swab as 'to rule out infection' (Gold specifies 'rule out COVID') and adding 'ruling out other potential causes' (loosely supported by 'instead of other things' in transcript but not explicitly in Gold). It omits the preliminary clinical impression and patient agreement, but core facts align well with no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: physical exam/vitals/chest (yes), diagnostic testing (COVID swab and labs, yes), disposition criteria (labs/vitals, yes), consult attending (yes). Missed: preliminary clinical impression of COPD exacerbation triggered by infection, context on temperature from earlier dialogue, and patient agreement. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims are directly verifiable in [D-43] of the transcript (exam, vitals, chest listen, COVID swab, labs, attending consult, disposition based on labs/vitals). Minor issues: 'knowledge graph' is not in transcript (unverifiable/hallucinated), 'rule out infection' slightly broadens 'rule out covid', and 'ruling out other potential causes' infers from 'instead of other things' but is plausible. Mostly grounded with no major fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question by outlining the doctor's plan at the end of the consultation, structured by examinations, tests, consultations, and criteria, with no significant off-topic content."
