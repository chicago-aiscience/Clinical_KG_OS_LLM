  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer captures some correct ROS negatives (no fever, no headache, no chest pain, no allergies, no chronic conditions). However, it contains notable factual errors: it claims dyspnea was not explicitly denied, but the patient clearly says “No” to difficulty breathing (P-11); it claims sore throat denial is not explicit, but it is explicitly denied (P-13); it treats chills/night sweats and myalgias/weakness as only “likely absent,” even though they are explicitly denied (P-14, P-15). It also adds unsupported clinical interpretations (e.g., “knowledge graph,” “secondary viral meningitis/encephalitis”) that are not part of the transcript or Gold Answer. Overall, the answer is partially correct but includes several inaccuracies and speculative statements.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer negatives include: no fever; no dyspnea; no headache; no sore throat; no chills/night sweats; no muscle aches/weakness; no chest pain; no sputum production; no blood with cough; no cough triggers (cold/environmental); plus additional history negatives (no chronic conditions, no meds, no prior surgeries/hospitalizations, no allergies, no relevant family history). Generated Answer covers: fever, headache, chest pain, allergies, chronic conditions, and mentions sore throat/chills/myalgias but incorrectly as implied/likely. It misses key ROS negatives about sputum/blood and cough triggers, and it omits several additional pertinent negatives listed in the Gold Answer (no meds, no surgeries/hospitalizations, no relevant family history). Net coverage is roughly around half to two-thirds of the Gold Answer items.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not well-grounded in the transcript: asserting dyspnea and sore throat denials are not explicit (they are), and presenting several negatives as merely implied/likely despite explicit denials. It also introduces content not present in the transcript (\"knowledge graph\" reference; discussion of meningitis/encephalitis; inferred absence of respiratory distress from mild cough). These are hallucinatory or speculative additions rather than transcript-grounded findings.",
    "relevance": "The response largely focuses on ROS negatives and attempts to explain their clinical significance (how absence of fever/dyspnea/chest pain suggests less acute severity), which is aligned with the question. Some content is tangential (e.g., knowledge-graph mention, meningitis/encephalitis discussion) but the majority remains on-topic."
