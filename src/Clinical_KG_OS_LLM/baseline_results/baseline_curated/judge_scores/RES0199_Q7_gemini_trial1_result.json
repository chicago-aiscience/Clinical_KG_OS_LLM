{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and consistent with the transcript and gold answer regarding the onset of symptoms (4 days ago for headache/cough) and the timing of the loss of smell (1 day ago).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details required by the prompt. Specifically, it fails to explicitly state that the severity of the headache and cough remained 'around the same' or stable over time, instead using terms like 'persistent' and 'present' which don't fully address the severity change. It also omits the specific timing of diarrhea (2 days ago), using the vaguer 'few days back' from the initial patient statement, and misses the progression of GI symptoms (vomiting yesterday, nausea today).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are grounded in the provided transcript and use correct citations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the prompt's questions regarding the timeline and symptoms, though it is less detailed than the gold answer in describing the progression of severity and specific gastrointestinal timing."
