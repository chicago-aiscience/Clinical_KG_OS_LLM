  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the sharp, strong pain on deep inspiration from [P-3], matching Gold, and duration of 20 minutes from [P-6]. Situations of occurrence (walking alone, studying) and resolution (engaged with others, manual tasks) align well with Gold's descriptions from [P-4, P-9, P-29]. Minor discrepancies include omitting the initial 'uncomfortable/odd' quality [P-2], overall 1.5-week onset, rest occurrence [P-11], and no worsening with exercise [P-10]; it adds interpretive links to nervousness [P-19] and anxiety attacks [P-20] not emphasized in Gold as direct characteristics. Core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: quality (sharp strong on deep breath), episode duration (20 min intermittent), occurrence (alone studying/walking to school), resolution (social engagement, hands-on tasks). Misses: initial uncomfortable/odd sensation [P-2], 1.5-week history [P-2/D-3], explicit at rest [P-11], no exercise worsening [P-10], no prior episodes/injury [P-5/P-17]. Covers ~85% of Gold's relevant points focused on question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: quality [P-3], nervousness/breathing [P-19], duration [P-6], stress/dad [P-8], situations [P-29], resolution including anxiety context [P-20/P-29]. Citations accurate; interpretive links (e.g., pain to nervousness) are patient-reported and plausible without fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question's elements (quality, duration, occur/resolve situations) with no off-topic content."
