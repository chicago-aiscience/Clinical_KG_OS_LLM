{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually correct based on the transcript. It accurately identifies the COVID-19 swab as the test ordered and self-isolation as the precaution. It correctly cites the doctor's intent to 'work this up further'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two specific and critical 'next steps' mentioned in the Gold Answer and the transcript: 1) The immediate transition to a physical exam [D-52], and 2) The clinician's plan to consult with 'the Doctor' (attending/supervisor) before returning to the patient [D-55]. It covers the test and precautions well but lacks the procedural next steps that conclude the encounter.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript. The references to [D-53] and [D-54] regarding ruling out COVID-19 and the husband's symptoms are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the prompt, focusing on the management plan, tests, and precautions. However, its 'Next Steps' section is more about diagnostic strategy than the specific procedural actions requested by the phrase 'next steps before concluding the encounter'."
