  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually perfect, correctly identifying COVID-19 as the primary condition, the swab as the specific test, the 24-48 hour turnaround time, and an alternative viral illness as the secondary diagnosis. These match the Gold Answer and transcript exactly.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all four specific components requested in the question. While it omits isolation and contact tracing details found in the Gold Answer, those points were not requested by the user's prompt. It provides comprehensive coverage of the required clinical details.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical claims are grounded in the transcript. The symptoms (headache, dry cough, loss of smell) are mentioned in P-1, D-12, and D-24. The diagnostic and turnaround details are explicitly stated in D-52. The answer does not introduce any information not present in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly focused and directly addresses each part of the query. It avoids the extra context found in the Gold Answer (isolation instructions) which makes it a more precise response to the specific question asked."
