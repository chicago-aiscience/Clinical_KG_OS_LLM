  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (asthma) and the excluding clinical finding (fever). However, it incorrectly attributes the doctor's statement to turn [D-44] instead of [D-45]. Turn [D-44] discusses COVID protocols, while [D-45] contains the specific quote about asthma and the differential diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key points required by the question: it identifies asthma, the condition under which it would be added (cough/shortness of breath without fever), and the reason it was excluded (presence of fever). It matches the core logic of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the presence of a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source context. It also provides an incorrect citation for the doctor's statement (citing [D-44] instead of [D-45]), though the content of the quote itself is grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without unnecessary fluff, despite the hallucinated reference to a knowledge graph."
