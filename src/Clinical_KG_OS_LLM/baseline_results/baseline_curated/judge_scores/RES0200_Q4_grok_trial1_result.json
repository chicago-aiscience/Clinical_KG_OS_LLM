  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 (referred to as 'Covid') as the alternative diagnosis due to symptom overlap with COPD exacerbation, specifies the COVID swab as the test, and states the turnaround time as 24 to 48 hours, all matching the Gold Answer and directly quoting/paraphrasing [D-52] without any factual errors or contradictions.",

Generated Answer covers all 100% of these points, including the reason for exclusion and citations.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript: 'symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid', 'covid swab', and 'hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours'. Citations are accurate; no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question (alternative diagnosis, specific test, expected turnaround time) with no off-topic content or tangents."
