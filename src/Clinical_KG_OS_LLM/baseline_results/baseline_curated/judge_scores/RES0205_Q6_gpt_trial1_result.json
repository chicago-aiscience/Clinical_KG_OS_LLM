  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated plan in [D-37]: (1) to listen to the heart and lungs and do a quick physical exam, and (2) to consult the doctor they are working with, review what was discussed, and then return to the patient to discuss next steps. These statements are consistent with the Gold Answer and do not introduce errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) auscultation of heart and lungs, (2) quick physical exam, (3) consultation with the supervising/working-with doctor, (4) review of what was discussed, (5) return to patient to determine next steps. \nKey Gold Answer points missed: (a) explicit note that this plan was foreshadowed at the beginning [D-1], (b) patient agreement [P-37], and (c) the Gold Answer’s interpretive note that no diagnosis/medication was provided and the transcript ends before findings/treatment. While (c) is more interpretive than strictly required by the question, (a) and (b) are part of the Gold Answer’s described structure and closure.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically [D-37]. No additional unsupported details (e.g., diagnosis, medications, exam findings) are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers the question by specifying the physical exam components and the described process for determining next steps, with no irrelevant content."
