    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies three core factors explicitly stated in the transcript: (1) exposure from hiking Friday and gardening Saturday, (2) the clinician’s estimate that attachment could be >72 hours, and (3) the patient’s prior tick bite with a bullseye/target rash treated with antibiotics.\n\nHowever, it misstates/omits the key geographic-risk rationale that appears in the Gold Answer: the doctor specifically referenced Strathroy and an Ontario Lyme distribution map and concluded it was “close enough to be considered…concerning.” The Generated Answer instead frames “geographic risk” around the deer tick being the main vector, which is not the geographic assessment and does not capture the map-based reasoning.\n\nIt also implies that deer-tick vector status “creates a risk profile even if the visual appearance…did not match,” which is not the clinician’s stated logic in the transcript (the clinician actually emphasized species matters, while still recommending antibiotics mainly due to possible prolonged attachment and local risk).",
    "completeness": "Included key points:\n- Outdoor exposure history (hiking + gardening).\n- Uncertain timing leading to concern about prolonged attachment.\n- Estimated attachment duration >72 hours.\n- Prior tick bite with target/bullseye rash and prior antibiotics.\n\nMissed/undercovered key points from Gold Answer:\n- Specific geographic location (Strathroy along the creek) and the doctor’s explicit use of the Ontario Lyme distribution map with “close enough…concerning point.”\n- Patient’s statement that in the area “they’ve been considering all ticks…as possibly carriers.”\n- The clinician’s “safer than not” framing and plan to send the tick for lab identification (mentioned in Gold Answer as part of the overall reasoning/context).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (exposures, >72h estimate, prior bullseye rash, deer tick as predominant vector). Minor ungrounded embellishments include referencing a “knowledge graph,” and the inference that the deer-tick discussion itself constituted the geographic risk assessment or that mismatch “did not match perfectly” still supported the risk—this linkage is not explicitly supported by the transcript and partially conflicts with the clinician’s emphasis that species matters.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on why prophylactic antibiotics were recommended and addresses the requested categories (exposure, duration, prior history). It is less responsive to the geographic-risk component specifically, which is central to the question."
