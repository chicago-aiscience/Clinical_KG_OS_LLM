  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly accurate but contains a few errors. It incorrectly states that the patient does not explicitly vocalize a cough, whereas in P-7 and P-8, the patient describes a dry cough as 'starting' and 'on its way.' It also categorizes 'muscle aches' as emerging/confirmed at consultation, while the Gold Answer (and P-20/21) suggests they were part of the general presentation alongside fatigue. Repeating 'difficulty breathing' in the emerging section is slightly redundant since it was already listed as an onset symptom.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the loss of smell (P-6), reduced appetite (P-2, P-18), the specific description of breathing as 'laborious' (P-3), and the mention of headaches (P-11). It covers the main phases (onset, recent, emerging) but with less detail than the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript, but it claims the patient did not vocalize the cough symptom, which is contradicted by P-7 ('I feel like I maybe could be starting one') and P-8 ('it feels dry like it's on its way'). Most other points are grounded in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the prompt's request to reconstruct the timeline across the specified timeframes (onset, yesterday/morning, and emerging)."
