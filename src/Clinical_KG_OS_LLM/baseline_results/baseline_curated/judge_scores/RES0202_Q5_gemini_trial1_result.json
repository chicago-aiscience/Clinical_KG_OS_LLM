  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with both the Gold Answer and the transcript. It accurately identifies the mother's suspicion that the illness came from school, the timeline of symptoms starting Wednesday after school, the absence of sick contacts outside of school, and the lack of notification from the school regarding exposures.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the Gold Answer: specifically, the school's requirement for a COVID test to return (to inform other families) and the supplementary context that the lack of travel or home environmental issues further narrowed the suspected source to the school.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It uses direct quotes ('hard to say') and provides accurate citations for the mother's reports [P-2, P-1, P-38, P-39]. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, addressing each part of the multi-part question (attendance as source, sick contacts inside/outside, and school notification) without including unnecessary tangents."
