  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: dry cough almost nonstop day (matches P-1, Gold), very short of breath (P-1, Gold), wheezing a lot (P-15, Gold), daytime persistent (P-1), nighttime less frequent every other/two days (P-18, Gold). No contradictions or errors in stated facts; minor interpretive detail on nighttime 'specifically wheezing' aligns with context (post-wheezing discussion in D-18/P-18) without discrepancy.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) dry cough ~2 weeks persistent/nonstop day (partial: dry/nonstop day covered, misses 2 weeks); (2) breathing difficulties (very SOB + hard time breathing esp severe wheezing: partial, only SOB); (3) wheezing a lot + more freq than bronchodilator (partial: a lot covered, misses freq detail); (4) chest tightness (missed entirely); (5) day vs night freq (night less, every other day: fully covered). Covers ~60% of key points (3 main symptoms partial, freq good, misses chest/duration/details).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable with accurate citations: cough dry/nonstop day [P-1], SOB/bronchodilator [P-1], wheezing [P-15], day freq [P-1], night symptoms/wheezing less/every other day [P-18]. No hallucinations; 'specifically wheezing' for night grounded in immediate transcript context (D-17/18 wheezing discussion).",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by structuring specific symptoms (cough character, breathing, wheezing; note misses chest but focuses on asked) and day/night freq differences directly, no off-topic content."
