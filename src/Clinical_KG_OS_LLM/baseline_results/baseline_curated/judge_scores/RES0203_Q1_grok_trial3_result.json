  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer specifies partial loss for both smell and taste, with details (strong bad smells yes, very salty yes, banana/normal no). Generated correctly identifies partial smell loss but incorrectly states 'apparent complete loss' for taste, contradicting Gold and transcript clarification in P-4. Cough is mild but misses 'dry' confirmation and other details like non-productive. Duration (2 days), consistency, onset simultaneity missed. Significant factual errors on taste degree and omissions lead to contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 3 symptoms (decreased smell partial w/details, taste loss partial w/details, mild dry cough), 2 days, consistent, cough dry/non-productive/consistent/same time/no triggers. Generated lists symptoms with degrees (partial smell, complete taste?, mild dry cough) but misses: duration, consistency, specific perceptions (bad smells, salty vs banana), cough details (dry confirmation, no sputum/blood, no worsening, onset, no triggers). Covers ~30% of key points (basic symptoms/degrees).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in P-1 (quotes accurate for initial report). Partial smell verifiable in P-1/P-4. Taste 'complete' based on P-1 'lost' but ignores P-4 partial clarification (salty yes, banana no), making degree claim unverifiable/misleading. Cough mild/dry in P-1/P-7. No fabrication, but selective use of transcript leads to incomplete grounding; citations accurate but miss key P-4/P-5/P-6/P-7/P-8.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists sensory (smell/taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms with degrees as asked, includes perception details minimally from P-1. No off-topic content, perfectly focused on question."
