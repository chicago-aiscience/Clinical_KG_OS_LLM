  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key facts from the Gold Answer: hereditary risk (mother had epilepsy, runs in family [P-26]) and medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose [P-9, P-23]). It correctly notes the relation to the patient's epilepsy diagnosis as a predisposing factor. Minor discrepancies include introducing a 'knowledge graph' for causal claims, which is not in the Gold Answer or transcript, but core facts remain consistent without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: hereditary risk (epilepsy runs in family, mom had it), medication non-adherence (forgot med [P-9], Keppra [P-23]), relation to diagnosis (genetic predisposition). Missed details: specific reason for forgetting (daughter's birthday disrupting routine [P-24]), seizures normally infrequent/well-controlled [P-9], combination of factors preceding seizure. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about missed dose [P-9, P-23] and family history [P-26] are directly verifiable with accurate citations. Patient's epilepsy [P-8] is grounded. However, 'knowledge graph' references establishing 'direct causation' and 'causal link' are not in the transcript, representing hallucinated external knowledge; plausible but unverifiable, impacting grounding.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured with sections directly addressing hereditary and medication risks for the seizure, plus explicit relation of family history to diagnosis, with no off-topic content."
