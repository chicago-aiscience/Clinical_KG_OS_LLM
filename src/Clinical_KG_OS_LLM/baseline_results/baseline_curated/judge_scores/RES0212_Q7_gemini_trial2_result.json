  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer's timeline perfectly. It correctly identifies the 3-month onset, the 1-month mark for sleep disruption, the 3-day mark for productive greenish sputum, and the 'past couple of days' for subjective fevers.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the specific milestones requested in the prompt. However, it is slightly less comprehensive than the gold answer because it omits the specific context of the initial onset (the pole dancing class) and the description of the cough's nature (dry and intermittent) during the first two months.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and include accurate citations [P-2, P-4, P-9, P-19, D-47]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, using a structured format to trace the timeline as requested by the prompt without any extraneous information."
