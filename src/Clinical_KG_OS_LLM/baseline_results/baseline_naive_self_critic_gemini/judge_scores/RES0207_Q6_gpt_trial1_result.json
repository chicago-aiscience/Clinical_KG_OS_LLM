  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts both the transcript and the Gold Answer. In D-37, the doctor clearly states they will review the information with “the doctor who’s working today,” then return shortly to discuss next steps, including whether tests are needed and how to move forward. The Generated Answer incorrectly states that no next steps were communicated and that the transcript ends around P-26, which is false given the provided D-37 and D-38 lines.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) doctor will review with the doctor working today; (2) collaborative decision-making with another physician involved; (3) doctor will return shortly to discuss next steps; (4) possible tests and plan to move forward; (5) no specific tests/treatments named yet; (6) patient agrees; (7) courteous close. The Generated Answer includes none of these and instead asserts no plan was discussed.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims are not grounded in the transcript: it says the consultation ends abruptly with the patient around P-26 and implies missing later doctor turns, but D-37 and D-38 are present and explicitly describe next steps. This is a major unfaithful assertion relative to the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at the correct topic (end-of-consultation next steps and follow-up), but it fails to answer the question as asked and substitutes an incorrect claim that no next steps were given. Some content is meta-commentary about turn IDs rather than the requested plan."
