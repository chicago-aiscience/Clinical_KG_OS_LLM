  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies sore throat, difficulty swallowing food, muscle aches, and fatigue, with accurate citations. However, it completely omits the major symptom of difficulty breathing (detailed in P-7 to P-11), misrepresents reduced sense of taste as 'not lost their taste' (patient said 'maybe taste a little bit,' indicating reduction per Gold), includes extraneous details like mono history and remedies not emphasized in Gold, and lists only one denial (loss of smell) instead of the full set (cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell, fever, chills). These are significant omissions and discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: sore throat (partial details), difficulty swallowing (yes), fatigue/muscle aches (yes), reduced taste (partial but inaccurate). Missed entirely: difficulty breathing (with full details), full denial list (cough [P-15], runny nose [P-16], headaches [P-17], chest pain [P-18], fever [P-23], chills/night sweats [P-24]; only loss of smell covered). Covers approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are verifiable in the transcript with correct citations (e.g., sore throat [P-2], taste [P-19], aches [P-25]). No hallucinations or fabricated facts; minor interpretive stretch on taste ('not lost' vs. 'maybe a little bit') is plausible and grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around 'Reported Symptoms' and 'Explicitly Denied Symptoms,' precisely matching the question's focus on symptoms reported and specific screened symptoms denied (cough, runny nose, etc.). No off-topic content, though incomplete."
