  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain explicit patient denials for chest pain, sore throat, chills, and GI complaints. However, the transcript shows the mother explicitly saying 'No' or 'I don't think so' to all these symptoms (P-13, P-14, P-19, P-22, P-23). It also misses several symptoms reported by the mother: decreased appetite, loss of taste, and a runny nose. It lists shortness of breath as a reported symptom, whereas the mother was actually uncertain and the Gold Answer classifies it as such.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses approximately 50% of the reported symptoms (appetite, taste, runny nose). Crucially, it fails to correctly identify the denied symptoms requested by the prompt, instead claiming they were not explicitly denied in the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinations regarding the transcript content by claiming denials were not present. Additionally, it includes references to a 'knowledge graph link' and '[SYMPTOM]' tags which are not part of the source transcript and appear to be artifacts or hallucinations from another context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to address both parts of the question, but the factual errors regarding the presence of denials and the missing symptoms significantly reduce its utility. It includes irrelevant technical jargon (knowledge graph). Scales at 3 because it attempts the specific categories requested but fails on accuracy and completeness within those categories.v"
