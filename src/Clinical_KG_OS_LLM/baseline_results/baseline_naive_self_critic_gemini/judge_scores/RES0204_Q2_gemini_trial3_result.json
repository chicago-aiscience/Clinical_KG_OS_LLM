  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is completely incorrect. It claims the transcript cuts off before diagnostic procedures are proposed, but the transcript explicitly mentions proposing a chest X-ray [D-37] and a COVID swab [D-39]. It also claims no rationale was provided for the COVID swab, whereas the transcript provides the specific rationale that 'we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately' [D-39].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to provide any of the key points requested by the question. It misses both diagnostic procedures (Chest X-ray and COVID swab) and the specific rationale for the COVID swab (institutional protocol for symptomatic patients).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source text. It hallucinates that the information is missing or that the transcript is incomplete for the purpose of the question, when the relevant information is clearly present in the provided segments [D-37 through D-40].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is not relevant as it refuses to answer the question based on a false premise that the data is missing, rather than addressing the specific prompts about procedures and rationale."
