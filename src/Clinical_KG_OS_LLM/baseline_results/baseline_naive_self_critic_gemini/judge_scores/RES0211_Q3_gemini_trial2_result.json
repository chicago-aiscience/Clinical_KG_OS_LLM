  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer's clinical reasoning. It correctly identifies the specific symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, fever) and the significance of the absent symptoms (sputum, GI issues, joint pain) in supporting a URI diagnosis over lower respiratory or systemic infections.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points, including the specific symptoms, the distinction between upper and lower respiratory tracts based on sputum, and the exclusion of other systemic illnesses. However, it misses the mention of the brother's recent cold as a source of viral exposure, which was included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. It mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the provided transcript, suggesting a slight hallucination of the source material's nature, although the clinical content attributed to it (malaise) is actually present in the transcript (D-15).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, structured specifically to address the multi-part question about how the presence and absence of certain symptoms support the specific diagnosis."
