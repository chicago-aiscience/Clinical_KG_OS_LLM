  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies a triad of symptoms (dry cough worsening over 3 days, fever ~100-101°F, possible loss of taste from P-17) leading to COVID alignment in D-44 and infectious conclusion via fever distinguishing from asthma in D-45. Generated Answer incorrectly states the transcript does not document change in taste (directly contradicted by P-17), misstates symptom duration as doctor-confirmed 5 days (D-3, but parent corrects to 3 days in P-4), attributes shortness of breath more definitively than transcript (P-8 equivocal), and omits taste from the combination despite question specifying it. Core logic of cough + fever → infection/COVID is correct, but significant errors on key symptoms and facts vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: triad (cough [P-1,P-5,P-12], fever [P-1,P-2], taste [P-17]), D-44 COVID alignment, D-45 fever → infection over asthma, acute onset/systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue, appetite). Generated covers cough (partial citation/timeline), fever, D-44/D-45 logic for infection/COVID; misses taste entirely, acute 3-day worsening precision, systemic details like fatigue/appetite/loss of taste as appetite proxy. Covers ~60% of key points (cough/fever/conclusion yes, taste/systemic no).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates 'transcript does not document [change in taste]' (P-17 explicitly states mother wonders about loss of taste due to disinterest in breakfast); misrepresents doctor 'confirmed' 5-day duration (D-3 doctor guess, P-4 parent corrects to 3); implies shortness of breath as firm respiratory symptom (P-8 parent uncertain/tiredness); other claims like dry cough worsening [P-1], temp details [P-1,P-2], D-44/D-45 quotes grounded. Multiple unverifiable/wrong claims (taste denial major hallucination).",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom combination for COVID alignment (cough + fever) and use for infectious conclusion (fever distinguishes from asthma per D-45), with citations; addresses question structure but dismisses taste despite query specifying it, adding minor off-topic denial; overall focused on clinical reasoning from transcript."
