  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the worsening cough, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain explicit denials for orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, and palpitations. The patient explicitly denies blood in sputum (P-7), orthopnea (P-9), PND (P-10), and palpitations (P-14). It also misses 'chills' as an endorsed systemic symptom.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a key systemic symptom (chills) and completely fails to list any of the denied symptoms requested in the prompt, despite them being present in the transcript. The Gold Answer provides a comprehensive list of negative findings which the generated answer ignores.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is not in the transcript when it clearly is. The patient provided clear 'no' responses to several specific symptoms asked by the doctor.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the first two parts of the prompt (endorsed symptoms and sputum changes) but fails to provide the requested information for the third part (denied symptoms), claiming it is unavailable."
