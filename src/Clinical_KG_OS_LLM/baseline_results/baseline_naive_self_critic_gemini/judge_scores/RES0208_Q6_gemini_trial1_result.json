  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is highly inaccurate. It claims that no diagnostic tests (like imaging or swabs) were ordered, no self-isolation instructions were given, and no timeline for results was mentioned. However, turn [D-37] in the transcript explicitly mentions a chest X-ray, a COVID swab, instructions to stay away from everyone including the wife, and a 24-48 hour timeline for results. It contradicts the Gold Answer and the source text significantly.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to identify the chest X-ray, the COVID-19 swab, the specific isolation instructions, the '24 to 48 hours' timeline, and the role of the public health nurse.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails the faithfulness check because it claims information is missing from the transcript when that information is clearly present in turn [D-37]. This is a negative hallucination (claiming absence where there is presence).",
    "relevance": "While the answer is structured to address the question's categories, it provides incorrect information for nearly every category, failing to provide the specific details requested by the prompt."
