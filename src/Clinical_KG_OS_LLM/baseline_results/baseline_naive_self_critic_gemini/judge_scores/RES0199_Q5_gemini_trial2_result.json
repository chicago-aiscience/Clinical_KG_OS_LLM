  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It states that the doctor did not explore the patient's living situation, workplace, travel history, or sick contacts. However, the transcript explicitly shows the doctor asking about the living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47, D-50], workplace [D-48], and travel history [D-49].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to include any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific details about the apartment, car dealership, and travel history, instead claiming these topics were never addressed.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contradicts the provided transcript. It claims there is 'no evidence' for questioning that is clearly documented in the text from turns D-45 to D-50. This is a significant hallucination of absence.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer attempts to address the question but provides a completely incorrect negative response, failing to provide the information requested by the prompt."
