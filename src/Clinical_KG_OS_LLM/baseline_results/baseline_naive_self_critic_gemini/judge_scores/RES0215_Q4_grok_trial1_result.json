  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the specific screening questions about fever [D-7], runny nose [D-8], sick contacts [D-10], recent travel [D-11], rashes [D-13], and phlegm production [D-31] were 'not captured in the provided transcript,' which directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the full transcript where these questions and negative patient responses [P-7, P-8, P-10, P-11, P-13, P-31] are explicitly present; furthermore, it fails to accurately describe the screenings for infectious causes (e.g., pneumonia, URTI, contagious infections, exposure-related, systemic/viral with rashes, productive cough) as outlined in the Gold Answer, instead pivoting to unrelated asthma triggers.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include specific screenings for each queried symptom (fever→infectious pneumonia/bronchitis; runny nose→URTI/viral wheeze; sick contacts→contagious; travel→exposure; rashes→systemic/allergic/viral; phlegm→productive infection; plus pain), all negative responses with citations, and narrowing to reactive airway disease; Generated Answer covers 0% of these, omitting all specific questions/responses and screenings while discussing unrelated elements like cold weather triggers and seasonal allergies.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of the key screening questions despite their clear presence in the transcript with exact citations; while some secondary citations (e.g., [P-38], [P-35]) for asthma-related details are accurate, the core claim of missing questions is a major fabrication, introducing unverifiable and false information about the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The question directly asks about conditions screened via the specified questions (fever, runny nose, etc.) and how patient responses narrowed the differential; Generated Answer dodges this by denying the questions' existence and shifts to other transcript elements (e.g., triggers, allergies) supporting asthma, making it largely off-topic from the query's focus."
