  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reproduces the major factual elements in the Gold Answer: (1) exposure history of hiking Friday and gardening Saturday, (2) clinician-estimated attachment duration >72 hours, (3) Strathroy identified as geographically concerning on an Ontario Lyme map, and (4) prior tick bite ~10 years ago with bullseye/target rash treated with antibiotics. A minor over-interpretation is the phrasing that the patient had “known susceptibility,” which is not explicitly stated in the transcript or Gold Answer (prior Lyme-like rash/history does not necessarily imply heightened biologic susceptibility).",
    "completeness": "It covers the key requested combination: exposure history, estimated attachment duration, geographic risk assessment, and prior bullseye-rash history. It omits some supporting nuances present in the Gold Answer/transcript that strengthen the rationale (e.g., patient uncertainty about when/where tick was acquired; patient comment about ‘all ticks in this area’ possibly carrying Lyme; plan to send tick for speciation; ‘safer than not’ framing). Overall it captures the core decision drivers but not all contextual elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate bracketed references (P-1, D-6, D-13, P-3). The only mildly ungrounded element is the inference of “known susceptibility,” which is not stated verbatim and could be considered interpretive rather than transcript-grounded. No major hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what the question asks: why prophylactic antibiotics were recommended despite the tick not resembling a deer tick and no current bullseye rash, emphasizing the combined risk factors."
