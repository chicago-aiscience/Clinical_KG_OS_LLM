  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer regarding the shortness of breath, the seizure history/epilepsy, and the temperature value. It does not contain any inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer omits the dry cough, which is a primary respiratory symptom reported in the transcript and gold answer. It also lacks the specific onset duration (3 hours) and the pertinent negatives (denial of chest pain, sore throat, etc.) that were included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and cited correctly (e.g., P-1, P-8, P-5).",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the specific categories requested in the question: respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and the objective fever measurement."
