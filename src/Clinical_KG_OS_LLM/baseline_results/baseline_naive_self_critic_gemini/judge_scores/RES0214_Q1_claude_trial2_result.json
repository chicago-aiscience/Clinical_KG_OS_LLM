  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) with appropriate citations. However, it contains a major factual error regarding the pertinent negatives. The transcript clearly shows the patient denied all five symptoms: cough [P-10], headache [P-8], neck stiffness [P-7], nausea [P-5], and difficulty swallowing [P-24, P-25, P-26]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states only cough was denied and claims there is 'no evidence' for the others, which directly contradicts the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the four reported symptoms adequately. However, it fails to address a critical part of the question - it only identifies 1 out of 5 denied symptoms when the Gold Answer clearly documents all five denials with specific citations. This represents a significant gap in completeness, missing approximately 80% of the pertinent negatives component of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is partially faithful to the transcript. The four symptoms are accurately cited. However, the statement 'There is no evidence in the provided transcript segments indicating that the patient explicitly denied headache, neck stiffness, nausea, or difficulty swallowing' is demonstrably false and contradicts the transcript. Exchanges [D-5/P-5], [D-7/P-7], [D-8/P-8], and [D-24/P-24, D-25/P-25] explicitly document these denials.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question structure by identifying the four symptoms and attempting to identify the denied symptoms. However, the severe incompleteness in identifying the pertinent negatives reduces its overall relevance to the full scope of the question, which specifically asked about five particular denied symptoms."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms with appropriate citations but contains a critical error in the pertinent negatives section. It claims only cough was denied and states there is 'no evidence' for the other denials, when the transcript explicitly documents the patient denying all five symptoms (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing). This represents both a factual error and a significant gap in completeness, covering only 20% of the required pertinent negatives while making false claims about the transcript content."
