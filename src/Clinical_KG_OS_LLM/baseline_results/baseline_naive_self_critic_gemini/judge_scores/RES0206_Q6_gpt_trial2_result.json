  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the plan in [D-43]: physical exam with vitals and chest auscultation, COVID swab and unspecified “labs,” consultation with attending, and disposition based on vitals/labs; it also correctly states suspected COPD exacerbation likely due to infection. No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers the main elements: (1) physical exam/vitals/chest, (2) COVID swab + labs, (3) attending consult, (4) admit vs discharge based on vitals/labs, (5) COPD exacerbation/infectious trigger. Minor omissions compared to Gold Answer: it doesn’t explicitly mention temperature check (noted earlier in the visit and implied under vitals), and it doesn’t include the explicit plan to “come back and talk to you” or the patient’s agreement, which the Gold Answer notes.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by [D-43]. No invented tests, treatments, or criteria beyond the transcript. The mention of “COPD exacerbation likely triggered by an infection” is grounded in [D-43].",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing examinations, tests, consultation, and the criteria for admission vs discharge; no extraneous content."
