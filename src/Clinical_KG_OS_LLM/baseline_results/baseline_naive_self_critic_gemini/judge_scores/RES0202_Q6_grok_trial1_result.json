  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment as an infection consistent with COVID-19 and notes the alternative viral illness if test negative, matching Gold [D-44, D-45]. It correctly details the COVID swab, 24-48 hour turnaround, false negative possibility, 14-day isolation, and all specific warning signs (high temp, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting). Minor discrepancy: introduces 'shortness of breath' as part of initial presentation, though patient denied it [D-8] and doctor referenced it hypothetically [D-45]; Gold does not list SOB as assessed symptom. Also, asthma is framed as 'ruled out' rather than 'not added due to fever,' but core facts align. No major errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key Gold points: assessment (infection/COVID-like), test/swab + TAT, isolation period, false negatives, alt dx (viral illness), warning signs (all listed with examples), asthma conditional note. Misses minor details: isolation 'including from younger sister if possible' [D-44]; explicit 'no medications, watchful waiting with return precautions.' Covers ~90-95% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [D-44, D-45]. Warning signs quoted precisely. Assessment phrases grounded. Minor issue: 'initial presentation included ... shortness of breath' – patient said 'I don't think so' [D-8], doctor hypothetical [D-45]; plausible but slightly stretched. No hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's elements (assessment/plan, test/TAT, isolation, alt dx if neg, false negs, specific warning signs with examples). No off-topic content; directly focused."
