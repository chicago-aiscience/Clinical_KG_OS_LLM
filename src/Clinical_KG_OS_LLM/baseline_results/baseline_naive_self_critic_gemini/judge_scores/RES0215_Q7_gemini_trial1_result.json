  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer captures the core timeline and symptoms correctly: the 4-5 day duration, the initial trigger of physical activity (playing tag), the fluctuating pattern, and the nocturnal episode. It correctly identifies the symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath. However, it misses the detail from the Gold Answer regarding the cough being non-productive (no phlegm) and misses the pertinent negatives (no fever, no cyanosis, child appearing well otherwise).",
    "completeness": "The answer covers most key points including the trigger, the pattern, the cough, and the nocturnal episode. It fails to include the pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer (fever, cyanosis, general appearance) and the specific detail that the cough was non-productive.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes references to a 'clinical knowledge graph' which is not present in the source transcript or the prompt. This constitutes a hallucination of the source material's structure, even if the clinical conclusions drawn are plausible. All clinical facts about the patient (tag, cold weather, wheezing) are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the four specific components requested in the prompt: initial trigger, fluctuating pattern, emergence of cough, and the nocturnal episode."
