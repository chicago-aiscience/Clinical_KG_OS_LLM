  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the patient's baseline as manageable, the 3-day window of decline, and the specific symptoms (cough, green-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, and dyspnea). It also accurately reflects the history of ER visits without hospitalization.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific frequency of rescue inhaler use at baseline (once every two weeks). 2) The specific impact on her activities of daily living, namely the difficulty with her usual dog walks. 3) The mention of a possible fever. 4) Crucially, the patient's explicit statement that this episode is 'probably the worst' she has ever had, which is central to the question about comparing severity.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It uses accurate citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-5], [P-12]) and stays within the scope of the provided text without hallucinating details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and addresses the prompt's questions about evolution, direction of symptoms, and comparison to prior episodes, although the comparison is limited to clinical history rather than the patient's subjective assessment of severity."
