  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core assessment as an infection likely COVID-19 [D-44, D-45], diagnostic test (COVID swab, 24-48 hours), false negative possibility, alternative viral illness if negative, 14-day isolation, and exact warning signs (high temp, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting) matching Gold and transcript. Minor discrepancies: inaccurately states 'initial presentation included ... shortness of breath' (parent denied clear SOB [P-8], doctor only hypothesized [D-45]); says 'rule out asthma as primary' (doctor said would consider if no fever, but infection likely now). These are minor interpretive issues, core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers all Gold key points: assessment (infection/COVID-like), test/TAT, false neg, alt dx (viral illness), isolation period (14 days), warning signs (all listed with examples like seizures). Misses minor details: isolation 'including from younger sister if possible' [D-44]; explicit 'no medications, watchful waiting'. Covers ~90-95% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-44, D-45] with accurate citations. Minor hallucination: attributes 'shortness of breath' to initial presentation (not reported by parent, only doctor hypothetical). 'Rule out asthma as primary' is plausible interpretation but slightly stretches doctor's wording. No major fabrications; largely grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the exact question elements (assessment/plan, test/TAT, isolation, alt dx/false neg, warning signs with examples); no off-topic content or tangents."
