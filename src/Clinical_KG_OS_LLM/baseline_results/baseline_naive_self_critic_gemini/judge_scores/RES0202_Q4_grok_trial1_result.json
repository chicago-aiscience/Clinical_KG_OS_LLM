  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition from [D-45] and fever as the excluding factor, matching Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancy: attributes fever duration confirmation to doctor via [D-3], but mother later corrects to 3 days ([P-4]); however, fever presence and role are accurate.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: asthma ([D-45]), hypothetical presentation (cough/SOB without fever), fever as excluding finding with citations ([P-1],[P-2]), shift to infection ([D-45]). Misses supporting details from Gold: no wheezing ([P-7]), uncertain SOB ([P-8]), nuance of not permanently ruled out but prioritized.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: asthma and hypothetical from [D-45], fever details from [P-1],[P-2],[D-3]. Quote accurate. No hallucinations; minor phrasing as 'knowledge graph' irrelevant but not hallucinatory.",
    "relevance": "Directly and fully addresses both parts of question (condition and excluding finding) with structured response focused on transcript evidence, no off-topic content."
