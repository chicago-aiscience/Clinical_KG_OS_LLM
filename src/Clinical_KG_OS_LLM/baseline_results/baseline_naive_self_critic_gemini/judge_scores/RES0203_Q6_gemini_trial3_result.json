  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the doctor's assessment of COVID-19, the diagnostic test (swab), the timeline (1-2 days), and the isolation instructions. However, it incorrectly states that no additional tests or follow-up were mentioned and that there was no mention of a supervising physician. The transcript explicitly mentions both in turn [D-40].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the assessment, the primary diagnostic test, the method of collection, the timeline, and the isolation instructions. It fails to include the mention of potential additional tests and the plan to consult with a supervising physician, both of which were specifically requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes a 'hallucination of absence.' It explicitly claims the transcript does not contain information about additional tests or supervising physicians, which is directly contradicted by the text in turn [D-40] ('There might be a couple other tests we want to do... we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today').",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure, addressing each point of the prompt, even though some points are answered incorrectly."
