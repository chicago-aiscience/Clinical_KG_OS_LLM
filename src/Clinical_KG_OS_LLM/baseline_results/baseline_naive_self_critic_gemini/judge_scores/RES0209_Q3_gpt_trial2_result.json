  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core asthma symptom cluster (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheeze, chest tightness) and notes that bronchodilator benefit plus increased use supports worsening asthma. However, it contains a minor inaccuracy/misattribution by implying chest tightness is only inferred from P-16 rather than directly affirmed at P-20. It also fails to state the key quantitative change in bronchodilator use (once every two weeks → 5–6 times/week), which weakens alignment with the question/Gold, though this is more an omission than a direct contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) classic asthma symptom profile (dry cough/SOB/wheeze/chest tightness), (2) bronchodilator provides relief, (3) increased reliance on bronchodilator in general terms.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (1) explicit prior confirmed asthma diagnosis since age 8, (2) the specific magnitude of bronchodilator increase (once every two weeks to 5–6 times/week), (3) wheezing occurring even more frequently than bronchodilator use, (4) exacerbation by typical triggers (exercise/cold air/pollen), and (5) clinician’s negative infectious/alternative-etiology screen (no fever, sick contacts, travel, anosmia, productive cough, etc.). Overall it captures only a minority of the Gold’s supporting evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer repeatedly references a “clinical knowledge graph” and specific KG relations (e.g., “[dry cough --RELATED_TO--> asthma]”), which are not present anywhere in the transcript. These constitute multiple hallucinated/ungrounded elements. While the symptom statements it quotes are largely transcript-supported, the KG-based justification and some interpretive linking (e.g., chest tightness inferred via P-16) are not directly grounded in the provided dialogue.",
    "relevance": "It generally addresses the question by tying the symptom combination plus increased bronchodilator use to worsening asthma rather than a new condition. However, it adds irrelevant framing about a knowledge graph and does not directly highlight the specific frequency change asked about, making it slightly less focused than ideal."

  "summary": "The response is directionally correct and mostly relevant, but it omits several key Gold Answer supports (especially the specific inhaler-frequency change and infection rule-outs) and includes ungrounded “knowledge graph” content that reduces faithfulness."
