  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, aligning closely with the Gold Answer's 'pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the context of an atopic predisposition.' Core diagnosis matches, but it omits 'pediatric' (appropriate for 8-year-old) and explicit 'atopic predisposition,' though seasonal allergies are noted. All cited facts and supporting evidence are accurate and consistent with Gold. Minor discrepancies in precision.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) exercise-triggered [P-3,P-41,P-6]; 2) episodic/reversible with rest [P-6,P-33]; 3) cold weather [P-38]; 4) multiple settings [P-38]; 5) seasonal allergies [P-35,P-36]; 6) nocturnal episode [P-43,P-44]; 7) pertinent negatives (fever [P-7], runny nose [P-8], sick contacts [P-10], phlegm [P-31]). Generated covers: exercise [P-3 partial], cold weather [P-38], rest resolution [P-6], allergies [P-35]; adds initial symptoms [P-1,P-2]. Misses multiple settings, nocturnal, all negatives, and some citations. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-3] out of breath playing tag; [P-38] worse in cold; [P-6] resolves with rest; [P-35] seasonal allergies; [P-1/P-2] wheezing/SOB). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; quotes/paraphrases match exactly.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers question by stating diagnosis and providing transcript-supported findings with bullets and citations addressing triggers, weather, rest, allergies, and symptoms. No off-topic content; perfectly focused."
