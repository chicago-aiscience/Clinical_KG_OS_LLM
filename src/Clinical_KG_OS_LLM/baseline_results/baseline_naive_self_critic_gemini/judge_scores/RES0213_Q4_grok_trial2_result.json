  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies screening for shortness of breath (dyspnea) matching Gold's point (5) with accurate citation [D-19/P-19], but incorrectly includes anxiety attacks as a screened and ruled-out condition, which is not listed in Gold Answer; it completely misses the other five conditions: trauma/injury [D-5], cardiac disease/exertional angina [D-10/D-20/D-11], infectious illness [D-12/D-27], asthma [D-23/D-24], and inherited arrhythmia [D-31/D-32]. This represents significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers 6 key conditions with specific inquiries and rulings out; Generated covers only 1 (dyspnea, ~17%) fully and adds anxiety (not in Gold), missing trauma, cardiac, infectious, asthma, and arrhythmia entirely; covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about dyspnea are verifiable [D-19/P-19]; anxiety inquiry verifiable [D-21/P-20], but assertion that anxiety attacks were 'effectively ruled out as the consistent cause' is a hallucinated interpretation—patient links symptoms to stress/anxiety contexts [P-8/P-9/P-13/P-15/P-29] and doctor does not rule it out; some claims plausible but not fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around screened conditions, inquiries, and patient responses per question, but only addresses a small subset (dyspnea and anxiety), making it partially relevant with limited scope."
