    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It claims that chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea were NOT explicitly asked about or denied in the transcript, when in fact these are directly addressed: runny nose [D-10, P-10], nausea [D-15, P-15], chest pain [D-16, P-16], and palpitations [D-17, P-17]. The Gold Answer clearly identifies these specific exchanges with citation numbers. The Generated Answer also fails to mention other pertinent negatives that were explicitly asked about (vision/hearing changes, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the majority of the explicitly denied symptoms (runny nose, nausea, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, vision/hearing changes, numbness/tingling). While it attempts to discuss clinical differentiation, it does so based on the incorrect premise that these symptoms were not asked about. The Gold Answer provides comprehensive coverage of all pertinent negatives and their diagnostic implications.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript by claiming symptoms were not asked about when they clearly were. For example, it states 'The provided transcript does not contain any explicit instances of the doctor asking about or the patient denying the specific symptoms listed in the prompt (chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea)' when these exchanges are present at D-10/P-10, D-15/P-15, D-16/P-16, and D-17/P-17. This represents significant hallucination through omission and misrepresentation of what is clearly documented in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer attempts to address the question about symptom review and differential diagnosis, it does so based on fundamentally incorrect information. The clinical reasoning discussion about differentiation is somewhat relevant but undermined by the false premise. About 40% of the content addresses the intended question, but the core factual foundation is wrong."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains critical factual errors by incorrectly claiming that chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea were not explicitly asked about in the transcript, when these symptoms are clearly addressed in exchanges D-10/P-10, D-15/P-15, D-16/P-16, and D-17/P-17. It misses most of the pertinent negatives identified in the Gold Answer and provides incorrect information that contradicts the source transcript. While it attempts to discuss clinical differentiation, this analysis is based on false premises. The answer demonstrates poor faithfulness to the source material and fails to accurately represent what was documented in the clinical encounter."
