  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Ventolin and Spiriva as respiratory inhalers with appropriate citations [P-11] and atorvastatin ('Torva Staten') as the non-respiratory drug [P-38]. However, it inaccurately states that the transcript 'does not provide a specific numerical frequency' for Ventolin use, contradicting [P-12] where the patient reports 'almost like 10 times this past week.' It also fails to specify the discontinued medication as a 'diuretic' [P-35] and does not explicitly note that discontinuation was without doctor's approval [P-36], only vaguely referencing [P-34]. These are significant factual errors and omissions compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: Ventolin and Spiriva as inhalers (✓), Ventolin used as needed (partial ✓), atorvastatin for cholesterol (✓). Missed or incomplete: exact Ventolin frequency of ~10 times past week, specification of discontinued medication as 'diuretic' for blood pressure, explicit detail that patient discontinued without doctor's approval [P-36], and doctor's response [D-37]. Covers ~40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about inhalers and atorvastatin are verifiable [P-11, P-38]. However, assertion of no 'specific numerical frequency' for Ventolin is incorrect and not grounded, as [P-12] provides '10 times.' Discontinued med reference [P-34] is accurate but incomplete without [P-35, P-36]; no outright hallucinations but multiple inaccuracies in representing transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the three parts of the question (medications including inhalers/non-resp, Ventolin frequency, discontinued med), with clear headings and transcript ties; no off-topic content."
