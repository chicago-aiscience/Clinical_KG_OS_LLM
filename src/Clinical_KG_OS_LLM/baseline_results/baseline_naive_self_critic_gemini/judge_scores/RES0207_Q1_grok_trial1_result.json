  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the sudden shortness of breath upon waking [P-1], seizure the previous night and epilepsy [P-8], and temperature of 37.4 [P-5], all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. No factual errors or contradictions in the stated facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: respiratory - sudden SOB on waking [P-1], ~3 hours prior [P-11], sudden dry cough no sputum [D-2,P-2,D-4,P-4]; neurological - seizure previous night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], fine after [P-8]; fever - 37.4°C that morning, mild [P-5,D-6,P-6]. Generated covers SOB [P-1], seizure/epilepsy [P-8], temp 37.4 [P-5]; misses cough entirely, 3-hour timing, dry nature, fine after seizure, °C unit, mild descriptor, morning confirmation. Covers ~50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-8, P-5]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three parts of the question (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, fever measurement) with no off-topic content."
