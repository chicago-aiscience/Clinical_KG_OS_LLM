  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains mostly accurate information but has one significant error. The diarrhea timeline is stated as '4 days ago' when the transcript clearly indicates it started '2 days ago' [P-28]. The vomiting timeline is vague ('a few days back') when the transcript specifies 'yesterday' [P-32]. Other facts (dry cough, 5-6 episodes daily, 2 vomiting episodes, 7/10 headache severity) are correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers basic facts but misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: no sputum/blood in cough [P-13], cough stable over 4 days [P-11], respiratory negatives (no SOB, wheezing, chest pain), headache location (forehead/top of head, bilateral) [P-5], no neck radiation [P-6], no neck stiffness [P-7], unusual for patient [P-10], vomiting contents (food) [P-34], no blood in vomit [P-33], no blood in stool [P-29], GI negatives (no bloating, constipation, appetite changes), loss of smell [P-24], and fatigue [P-19]. Coverage is approximately 40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with proper citations. However, the incorrect diarrhea timeline ('4 days ago' vs actual '2 days ago') represents a factual error from the source material. The vague 'a few days back' for vomiting onset is less precise than what the transcript states. All other claims are verifiable with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all four components asked in the question: respiratory symptoms (cough nature), GI symptoms (diarrhea frequency, vomiting episodes), and headache severity. However, it provides minimal detail on 'specific characteristics' of each symptom as requested, focusing mainly on onset timing and basic descriptors."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a partially correct response with accurate information about cough nature (dry), diarrhea frequency (5-6 times daily), vomiting episodes (2), and headache severity (7/10). However, it contains a significant error in the diarrhea timeline (stating 4 days instead of 2 days) and lacks substantial detail found in the Gold Answer, including important negatives (no blood, no SOB), specific symptom characteristics (headache location, cough stability), and additional reported symptoms (loss of smell, fatigue). The answer addresses the question components but provides insufficient depth on the 'specific characteristics' requested."
