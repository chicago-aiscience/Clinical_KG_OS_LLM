  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer on the major points it addresses: it correctly states the patient is managing acid reflux with dietary avoidance (acidic foods/chocolate) rather than medication, and that the patient is requesting medication for the cough but has not been prescribed anything yet in the transcript. It does not introduce clear contradictions. Minor imprecision: it says the cough is “causing anxiety among colleagues,” whereas the transcript states coworkers are “scared” when the patient coughs (similar meaning but not verbatim).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) reflux managed by diet alone; (2) patient is seeking cough medication and none is prescribed/recommended in the transcript. Key points missed: (1) explicit statement that the patient is currently taking no prescribed medications at all; (2) the discontinued anxiety medication from 2–3 years ago; (3) hay fever noted with no treatment described; (4) clinician plan to do exam and consult supervising physician before next steps. Overall, it captures some but not all of the cross-condition medication/treatment status requested.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript (dietary reflux management, cough characteristics, negative COVID test, requesting medication, not currently taking cough meds). The “anxiety among colleagues” phrasing is not directly stated (they are ‘scared’), but it is a minor paraphrase rather than a major fabrication. No major hallucinated medications or treatments are added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on current medication/treatment status (reflux and cough, and whether prescribed meds are being taken). It includes some symptom detail about the cough, which is slightly beyond the question, but still contextually relevant. Main relevance gap is omission of anxiety and hay fever medication/treatment status, which the question explicitly asks to cover across all conditions."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and grounded for reflux and cough, but it omits key cross-condition medication history (stopped anxiety meds, no current prescribed meds overall, hay fever status) and the clinician’s pending plan, reducing completeness and slightly relevance."
