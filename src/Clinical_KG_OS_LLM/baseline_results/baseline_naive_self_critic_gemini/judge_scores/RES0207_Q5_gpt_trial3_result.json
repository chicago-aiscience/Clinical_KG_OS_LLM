  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main contributors in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (patient forgot their anti-seizure medication and thought that triggered the seizure [P-9]) and (2) hereditary predisposition (epilepsy runs in the family; mother affected [P-26]). It also correctly links family history to the patient’s underlying epilepsy diagnosis (patient reports having epilepsy/seizure disorder [P-8]). Minor issues: it does not name Keppra specifically (though it correctly references “medication”), and it adds an unsupported “knowledge graph” assertion that forgetting medication is a risk factor per the knowledge graph (not part of transcript).",
    "completeness": "Covers the two key categories of risk factors (hereditary + medication nonadherence) and specifies maternal epilepsy. Misses several Gold Answer details: the medication name (Keppra [P-23]), the reason for missing the dose (daughter’s birthday/disrupted dinner routine [P-24]), and the contextual point that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent [P-9]. Overall, it captures the core but not the supporting specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript (forgot meds [P-9]; mother had epilepsy [P-26]; patient has epilepsy [P-8]). The reference to a “knowledge graph” and its stated relationship (“According to the knowledge graph…”) is not in the transcript and is thus unverifiable, though it does not introduce a new clinical fact beyond what the patient already implied.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by addressing both hereditary and medication-related contributors and explaining how family history relates to the patient’s epilepsy diagnosis. No meaningful irrelevant content beyond the brief ‘knowledge graph’ framing."

  "summary": "The answer is clinically aligned with the main Gold points (missed anti-seizure medication and maternal epilepsy history) and is highly relevant, but it omits several transcript-supported specifics (Keppra, birthday-related disruption, infrequent seizures) and includes a minor unverifiable “knowledge graph” claim."
