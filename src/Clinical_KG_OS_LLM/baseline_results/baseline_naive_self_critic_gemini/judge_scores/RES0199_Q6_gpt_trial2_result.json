  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All included elements match the Gold Answer and transcript: COVID-19 swab ordered, isolate for 14 days, contact tracing if positive, supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep/rest, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Minor wording (“any pain,” “viral symptom management”) slightly generalizes but does not contradict the transcript or Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points (test, 14-day isolation, contact tracing condition, supportive care measures). Misses two items explicitly present in the Gold Answer/transcript: (1) expected test result timeframe (24–48 hours) and (2) mention that if not COVID it could be another viral illness going around. Also does not explicitly state that no prescription medications were ordered beyond supportive care (not strictly required but part of Gold Answer).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are grounded in [D-52] and do not introduce new diagnostic tests or treatments. The generalization to “any pain” is a mild expansion of ‘muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that’ but remains consistent with the transcript; no clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question components (test ordered, isolation duration, contact tracing trigger, supportive care recommendations) with no meaningful tangents."
