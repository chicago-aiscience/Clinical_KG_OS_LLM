  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript ends at [P-47] with no conclusion, ignoring [D-47] (explicit summary assessment of cough duration, recent worsening, greenish sputum without blood, no constitutional symptoms, and plan to review with doctors) and [D-48] (response to patient), directly contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate citations and characterization.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: summary assessment details from [D-47] (cough for ~3 months worsened last 3 days, nighttime awakening, greenish sputum no blood, no constitutional symptoms); plan to review story with supervising doctors; patient adds exercise concern [P-47]; 'We'll see what we can do' [D-48]; no tests/treatments ordered; next steps guided by supervising physician. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying their existence.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that dialogue ends at [P-47] without doctor response (false, includes [D-48]/[P-48]); misinterprets [D-47] as not a conclusion/summary/plan; fabricates absence of clinical reasoning/plan despite [D-47]'s explicit recap and next step; minor error claiming 'night sweats' in HPI (denied in [P-5]). Largely fabricated.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by stating the plan/assessment/next steps info is unavailable in the transcript, with no irrelevant tangents beyond brief HPI recap."
