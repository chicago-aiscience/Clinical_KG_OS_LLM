  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer aligns closely with Gold on core timeline: onset symptoms (SOB, fatigue, weakness, appetite loss, laborious breathing), recent fever (yesterday), loss of taste (morning), emerging cough and sore throat. Minor discrepancies include omission of body aches (placed in onset by Gold), loss of smell (morning), and headaches (emerging); incorrect citation for sore throat query (attributes to D-6, which is smell, not sore throat); slight misphrasing of doctor's summary in D-36. Core facts remain accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: onset (SOB, fatigue/rundown/tired/weakness, laborious breathing, reduced appetite - 5/6, misses body aches); yesterday fever (1/1); morning loss of taste (1/3, misses smell and novelty); emerging cough and sore throat (2/3, misses headaches). Covers ~80% of Gold's specified points with similar structure.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims directly verifiable: e.g., onset from P-1-P-3, fever P-4, taste P-4, cough P-7/P-8, sore throat P-9, doctor's summary D-36. Minor issues: misattributes sore throat question to D-6 (actually smell; sore throat is D-9); paraphrases doctor's 'very cool sort of a sore throat' inaccurately; 'intensified' breathing not explicitly stated but inferred. No major hallucinations, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly reconstructs timeline into three phases matching question (onset couple days ago, recent fever/loss of taste, emerging at consultation); structured response with citations; no off-topic content."
