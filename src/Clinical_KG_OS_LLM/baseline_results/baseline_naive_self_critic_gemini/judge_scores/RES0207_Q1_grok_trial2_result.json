  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer includes only facts that are fully consistent with the gold answer and transcript: sudden shortness of breath upon waking [P-1], seizure the previous night and epilepsy [P-8], temperature of 37.4 [P-5]. There are no factual errors, contradictions, or inaccuracies in what is stated.",
    "completeness": "Key points from gold answer covered: sudden-onset shortness of breath upon waking [P-1], seizure previous night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], temperature 37.4 [P-5]. Key points missed: cough (sudden that morning, dry, no sputum) [D-2, P-2, D-4, P-4], shortness of breath started ~3 hours before [P-11], felt fine after seizure and went to bed [P-8], fever described as mild and confirmed as morning measurement [P-5, D-6, P-6], explicit units of degrees Celsius. Covers approximately 30-40% of key points, with complete omission of cough (a primary respiratory symptom).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1], [P-8], [P-5]. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the question, structured directly by respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and fever measurement, with no irrelevant or off-topic content."
