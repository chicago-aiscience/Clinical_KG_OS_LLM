  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains all core facts from the Gold Answer but omits some contextual details. It correctly identifies shortness of breath, seizure/epilepsy, and the 37.4°C temperature. However, it misses the cough symptom (a key respiratory symptom explicitly mentioned in P-2, P-4), timing details (3 hours before consultation), and the characterization of the cough as dry. The fever measurement is correct but lacks the descriptor 'Celsius' and the patient's characterization as 'kind of mild.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of key points from the Gold Answer. It includes: (1) shortness of breath upon waking, (2) seizure previous night, (3) epilepsy diagnosis, and (4) temperature of 37.4. However, it completely omits: (1) the cough symptom and its dry nature, (2) timing of symptom onset (3 hours prior), (3) unit of temperature measurement (Celsius), (4) patient's characterization of fever as mild, (5) all pertinent negatives (no chest pain, no feeling faint, no sore throat, no runny nose, no prior shortness of breath episodes), and (6) patient feeling 'fine after' the seizure.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The shortness of breath is referenced to P-1, the seizure and epilepsy to P-8, and the temperature to P-5. No hallucinated information is present. However, the answer is incomplete rather than unfaithful, as it fails to include the cough which is clearly discussed in the transcript (D-2, P-2, D-4, P-4).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and objective fever measurement. However, it provides an incomplete response to the respiratory symptoms portion by omitting the cough. The format is clear and focused, with appropriate citations. No irrelevant content is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies core facts including shortness of breath, seizure/epilepsy, and temperature measurement (37.4), with accurate citations. However, it has a significant omission by completely missing the cough symptom (both its occurrence and dry nature), which is a major respiratory symptom explicitly discussed in the transcript. It also lacks important contextual details such as timing (3 hours prior to consultation), temperature unit (Celsius), fever characterization ('kind of mild'), and all pertinent negatives. The answer is faithful to the source material with no hallucinations but is incomplete in coverage of key clinical details that would be important for comprehensive documentation."
