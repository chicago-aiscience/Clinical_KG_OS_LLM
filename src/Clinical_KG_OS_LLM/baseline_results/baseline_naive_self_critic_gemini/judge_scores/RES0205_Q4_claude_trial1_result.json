  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition ruled out and mentions the COVID test. However, it contains a significant factual error regarding timing. The Gold Answer clearly states the test was performed 'at the onset of symptoms approximately two weeks prior' and quotes 'I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago' [P-36]. The Generated Answer states the test was 'conducted during this prolonged period of symptom persistence,' which misrepresents the timing. The workplace concerns are mentioned but incompletely.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the basic elements (condition, test, workplace concern) but misses critical details. It omits: (1) the specific timing statement from P-36 about the test being done two weeks ago at symptom onset, (2) the patient's occupation as hospital clerk [P-34], (3) the PPE usage detail [P-17], (4) the patient staying home since testing negative [P-36], (5) the desire to return to work without coughing [P-36], and (6) the dual workplace concerns (infection control in hospital environment + social pressure from scared coworkers). Coverage is approximately 40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains claims not accurately grounded in the transcript. The statement about test timing 'during this prolonged period of symptom persistence' contradicts P-36 which explicitly states the test was done 'when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.' The answer attempts to synthesize information but creates an inaccurate timeline. Other facts are verifiable but the timing error represents a significant grounding issue.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses all four components of the question (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns) making it structurally relevant. However, the depth and accuracy of responses vary, with the timing component being particularly weak. The workplace concern section is superficial compared to what the question requests. Overall relevance is moderate to good."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer identifies the correct condition (COVID-19) and test but contains a critical factual error about timing, stating the test occurred 'during this prolonged period of symptom persistence' when P-36 clearly indicates it was performed at symptom onset two weeks prior. The answer misses substantial detail about workplace context including the patient's hospital clerk role, PPE usage, staying home since testing negative, and the dual nature of workplace concerns (infection control environment + coworker anxiety). Coverage is incomplete at approximately 40-50% of key points, and the timing misrepresentation represents a significant faithfulness issue despite other claims being verifiable."
