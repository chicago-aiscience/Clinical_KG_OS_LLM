  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient takes Reactine (an OTC antihistamine) for seasonal allergies [P-36] and confirms no prescribed medications [P-36], consistent with the Gold Answer. It also notes OTC medications generally. However, it introduces a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' reference, which is a factual error not in the Gold Answer or transcript. Core facts match, but this and omission of no treatment for respiratory episodes represent minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) No medications/treatments for current respiratory episodes (resolve on own) - missed; 2) Occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies - covered; 3) No prescribed medications - covered; 4) No regular medications - partially covered via no prescribed; 5) Past viral infections required no antibiotics - missed. Covers approximately 50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine, OTC stuff, and no prescribed medications are directly verifiable in [P-36], [P-46], [P-47]. The 'Knowledge Graph explicitly links' is not in the transcript, representing a hallucinated detail. Otherwise mostly grounded, with one unverifiable addition.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by listing medications (Reactine/OTC for allergies) and confirming no prescribed medications, with structure focused on current management. No irrelevant content or tangents, though incomplete on respiratory treatment."
