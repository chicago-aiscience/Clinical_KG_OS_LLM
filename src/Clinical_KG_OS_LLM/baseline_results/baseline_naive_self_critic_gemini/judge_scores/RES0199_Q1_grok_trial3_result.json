  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compare to Gold: Matches dry cough onset 4 days [P-1,P-12]; diarrhea liquid stools 5-6x/day [P-28]; vomiting 2 episodes yesterday [P-32]; headache persistent [P-3], 7/10 [P-8], onset 4 days [P-1]. Minor discrepancy: diarrhea onset ~4 days [P-1] vs Gold's precise 2 days [P-28]; no contradictions, core facts (nature cough, freq diarrhea, num vomiting, sev headache) correct; omissions (e.g., no sputum, headache location) are not errors.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: cough dry + onset; diarrhea liquid + freq; vomiting # episodes + timing; headache persistent + severity + onset (~50-60%). Missed: cough stable/no sputum/blood + resp negatives (SOB/wheeze/chest pain); diarrhea precise 2d onset + no blood; nausea + vomit food contents/no blood + GI negatives (bloating/constipation/appetite); headache bilateral forehead/top/no radiation/no stiffness/unusual; loss smell + fatigue.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: dry cough [P-12], onsets [P-1], diarrhea details [P-28], vomiting [P-32], headache persistent [P-3]/severity [P-8]. Diarrhea onset ~4d slightly loosely tied to [P-1] ('few days back' after 4d start), but P-28 clarifies 2d; no fabricated info, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly focused: sections for Respiratory (cough nature/onset), Gastrointestinal (diarrhea freq/nature, vomiting #), Headache (nature/severity/onset); directly answers question specifics with no tangents or irrelevance."
