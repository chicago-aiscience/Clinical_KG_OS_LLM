  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered and ruled out, matching the Gold Answer. It accurately reports the mother’s cited negatives: no shortness of breath and no wheezing, including that these do not occur even with physical activity. No contradictory or incorrect clinical claims are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) asthma as the ruled-out condition; (2) absence of shortness of breath; (3) absence of wheeze; (4) explicit note that these symptoms are absent even with physical activity.\nKey elements missed relative to Gold/Question: (1) explicit mention that the family history was in the grandparents; (2) the mother’s statement that he had “been worked up for that” (prior evaluation) supporting exclusion; (3) the additional distinguishing context from P-24 (pretty healthy otherwise / never had a dry cough like this before), which the Gold Answer includes (though this is less central to the question than the exercise-related negatives).",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are grounded in [P-28]. The answer does not add unsupported findings. The phrasing “any related symptoms” is a reasonable paraphrase of “anything like that” in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses what condition was ruled out and the specific negative symptoms (including during physical activity). Minimal extraneous content."
