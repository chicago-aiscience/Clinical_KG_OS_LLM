  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the home medication and the headache as the target symptom. It accurately lists the doctor's recommendations for fever (antipyretics/Tylenol), muscle/joint aches (Tylenol/NSAIDs), and supportive care (hydration, nutrition, sleep, isolation). One minor error is citing [P-1] for Tylenol, as the medication is first mentioned in [P-3].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer, including the specific medications and most supportive measures. However, it misses the mention of the COVID-19 swab test, the fact that no prescriptions were ordered, and the patient's self-initiated hydration efforts mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical information provided is directly supported by the transcript. The citation [P-1] is technically incorrect for the specific claim about Tylenol, but the information itself is grounded in the later dialogue ([P-3], [P-4]).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the question perfectly. It avoids extraneous information and focuses specifically on the home medication, the target symptom, and the doctor's subsequent recommendations."
