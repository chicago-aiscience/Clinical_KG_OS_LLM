  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript 'cuts off prior to the doctor making any medical decisions or proposing diagnostic procedures' and that there is 'no reference to the specific rationale for ordering a COVID swab.' This is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows in [D-37] and [D-39] that the doctor proposes both a chest X-ray and COVID swab, with specific rationale provided for the COVID swab ('we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately'). The Generated Answer completely contradicts the transcript content.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) the chest X-ray proposal, (2) the COVID swab proposal, (3) the specific rationale for the COVID swab (institutional protocol for respiratory symptoms), (4) the explanation given to the patient about procedures, and (5) confirmation of no medications. Instead, it incorrectly claims this information is not present.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not faithful to the transcript. It claims information is absent when it is clearly present in [D-37], [D-39], and [D-40]. The claim that 'the interaction cuts off prior to the doctor making any medical decisions' directly contradicts the transcript where the doctor explicitly discusses both diagnostic procedures and their rationale. This represents a significant failure in accurately representing the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is completely irrelevant as it states the question cannot be answered, when in fact the transcript contains all necessary information to answer the question. Rather than addressing what diagnostic procedures were proposed and the COVID swab rationale, it incorrectly claims this information is unavailable. This represents a fundamental failure to address the question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect and fails on all evaluation dimensions. It falsely claims the transcript does not contain information about diagnostic procedures or COVID swab rationale, when this information is explicitly present in [D-37], [D-39], and [D-40]. The doctor clearly proposes a chest X-ray and COVID swab, providing specific rationale that COVID swabs are being done 'with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately.' The Generated Answer's claim that the transcript 'cuts off' before medical decisions is factually wrong, demonstrates zero faithfulness to the source material, provides no relevant content, and covers none of the required key points."
