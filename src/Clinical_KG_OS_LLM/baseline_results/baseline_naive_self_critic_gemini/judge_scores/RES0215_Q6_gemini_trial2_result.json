  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect as it claims the doctor's plan is not in the text and that the transcript ends at [P-44]. The transcript actually continues to [P-59], and the plan is clearly stated in [D-58].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses 100% of the doctor's stated plan (physical exam, physician consultation, and follow-up). It also misses the specific home environment factors (smoking, carpets, pets, fireplaces, air filters) discussed in segments [D-50] to [D-57].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the transcript is incomplete and ends at [P-44]. Because it denies the existence of the rest of the text, it fails to ground its response in the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The answer fails to address the first half of the question entirely. While it identifies some environmental factors (weather and allergies), it misses the primary home assessment mentioned in the prompt's second half."
