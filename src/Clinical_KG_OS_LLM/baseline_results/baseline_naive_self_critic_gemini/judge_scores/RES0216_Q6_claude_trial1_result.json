  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment of asthma recurrence being at the top of the differential, the planned lung auscultation, the rescue inhaler recommendation, and the contingency plan to reassess if initial treatment fails. The mention of cardiac ischemia being lower on the differential is also correctly included. All major facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all four main components requested: (1) overall assessment (asthma recurrence), (2) physical examination components (lung auscultation), (3) first-step treatment (rescue inhalers), and (4) contingency approach (reassess if no improvement). However, it omits some details present in the Gold Answer, such as the mention of the doctor consulting with the supervising physician [D-35, D-37], the specific framing as a 'therapeutic trial,' the 'one thing at a time' stepwise approach language [D-36], and the patient's lack of current rescue inhaler [P-17, P-18]. These are minor omissions but represent ~15% of key details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The assessment of asthma recurrence [D-35], physical exam plan [D-35], rescue inhaler recommendation [D-35], and contingency plan [D-35, D-36] are all directly supported with appropriate citation markers. The cardiac ischemia discussion [D-36] is also accurately referenced. No hallucinated content detected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question: assessment, physical examination components, first-step treatment, and contingency approach. The content is well-organized and focused. The cardiac ischemia mention, while not explicitly requested, provides helpful context for the diagnostic reasoning. No irrelevant tangents present."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and faithful assessment of the clinical plan, correctly identifying asthma recurrence as the top differential, the planned lung examination, rescue inhaler trial, and contingency reassessment. All claims are verifiable in the transcript with proper citations. The response covers all major requested components but omits some minor details present in the Gold Answer, such as the consultation with the supervising physician and specific phrasing about the stepwise approach, warranting a slightly reduced completeness score."
