  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the medication tried (decongestants), the patient's assessment (worked a little bit), and the recommended OTC medication (Tylenol Cold). All facts align perfectly with the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several nuanced points included in the Gold Answer: 1) The patient's specific reasoning for why the medication 'worked a little bit' (the transition from stuffy to runny nose); 2) The doctor's recommendation for hydration as part of supportive care; 3) The doctor's mention of the multi-week timeframe for recovery. It covers about 50-60% of the detail provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript with correct speaker citations ([P-10], [D-39]). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the three specific parts of the question without any extraneous information."
