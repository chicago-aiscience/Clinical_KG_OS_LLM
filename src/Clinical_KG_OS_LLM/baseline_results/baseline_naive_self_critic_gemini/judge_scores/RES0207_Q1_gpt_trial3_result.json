  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All included statements match the transcript and Gold Answer: sudden shortness of breath on waking [P-1], seizure the prior night with known epilepsy [P-8], and a measured temperature of 37.4 that morning [P-5]. No contradictory or clearly incorrect facts are introduced. However, the answer omits the concurrently reported cough and its characterization (dry), which are part of the respiratory symptom set in the Gold Answer; this is an omission rather than an inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) sudden-onset shortness of breath, (2) seizure previous night with epilepsy, (3) objective fever measurement 37.4. Key elements missed: (1) cough also starting that morning, (2) dry cough/no sputum, and (3) that the temperature was described as mild and measured that morning (and units of Celsius). Overall, it captures the main neurological symptom and the fever measurement but incompletely captures the respiratory symptom profile.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript citations provided ([P-1], [P-8], [P-5]). No hallucinated symptoms or measurements are added. The only limitation is lack of detail (e.g., cough and units), not ungrounded content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked domains (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and an objective fever measurement) without tangents. Although incomplete, what is provided is directly responsive to the question."
