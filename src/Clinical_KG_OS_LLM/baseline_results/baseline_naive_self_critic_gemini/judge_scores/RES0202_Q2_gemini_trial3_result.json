  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID swab, the 24-48 hour window for results, the 14-day isolation period, the specific mention of the younger sister, and the emergency care criteria (high temperature, neurological symptoms, seizures, etc.).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the core management measures requested in the prompt. However, compared to the Gold Answer, it omits several points: the mention of the household composition (parents), the possibility of false negatives/other viral illnesses, the fact that no medications were prescribed (supportive care), the school's requirement for a test, and the mother's comments on viral treatment. It covers approximately 50-60% of the unique points found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically from section [D-44]. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses every part of the user's multi-part question without adding extraneous information. It is very well-structured for the specific query."
