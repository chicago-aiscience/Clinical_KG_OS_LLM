  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. All mentioned measures (COVID swab with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation including from younger sister, ER criteria for high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness, dizziness, or fainting) match exactly without errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab test and timing [D-44], 14-day isolation [D-44], isolation specifically from younger sister [D-44], ER precautions with detailed symptoms [D-44]. Missed: full household composition (parents and sister from [P-35]), false-negative possibility and other viral illness [D-44], no medications/supportive care/wait for results [D-44], mother's acknowledgment of viral care [P-41], school test requirement [P-41]. Covers core management measures (approx. 80%) but omits contextual details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-44]: COVID swab and timing, 14-day isolation including from younger sister, specific ER criteria. Citations are accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question's focus on diagnostic tests (COVID swab), isolation instructions/duration (14 days), and specific household member (younger sister), with ER management as a relevant addition. Structured bullet points are perfectly focused with no off-topic content."
