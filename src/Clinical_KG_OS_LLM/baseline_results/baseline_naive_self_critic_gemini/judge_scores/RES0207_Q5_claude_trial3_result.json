  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies both key risk factors: medication non-adherence (forgetting Keppra) and hereditary predisposition (maternal epilepsy). It accurately cites P-9 for the medication lapse and P-26 for the family history. The facts align with the Gold Answer, though expressed more concisely.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the essential elements but lacks some details present in the Gold Answer. It omits: (1) the specific context of the daughter's birthday disrupting the routine, (2) the patient's acknowledgment that missing medication 'might have' caused the seizure, (3) that seizures are normally infrequent suggesting good control with medication, (4) the specific medication name (Keppra), and (5) the usual dinner-time dosing routine. However, it does cover both main risk factors and their relationship to the diagnosis, addressing approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The medication lapse is documented in P-9, P-23, and P-24. The maternal epilepsy history is confirmed in P-26. The self-identification with epilepsy is in P-8. The reference to a 'knowledge graph' appears to be an artifact of the system generating the answer but doesn't introduce hallucinated clinical content. All citations are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's two components: hereditary and medication-related risk factors, and how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. The structure mirrors the question format with clear sections. No irrelevant information is included. The answer stays focused on the requested information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies both medication non-adherence and hereditary predisposition as risk factors, with accurate citations. It directly addresses the question and contains no hallucinated content. However, it lacks contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the daughter's birthday disrupting the medication routine, the medication name (Keppra), and the inference about normally good seizure control. The answer is factually sound but less comprehensive than ideal, covering approximately 70% of the key points from the Gold Answer."
