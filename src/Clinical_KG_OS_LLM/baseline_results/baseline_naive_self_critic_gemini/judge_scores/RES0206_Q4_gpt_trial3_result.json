  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition to rule out as COVID-19 and the ordered test as a COVID swab, consistent with [D-43]. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript contains no information about recent social contacts/exposure history. In fact, the patient reports meeting friends to walk dogs and that one friend had been sick, with occasional close proximity outdoors [P-20], which is exactly the exposure detail that prompted consideration of COVID. This is a significant error because it answers a core part of the question incorrectly.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points for the question: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) order COVID swab, (3) prompting social-contact detail: sick friend during dog walks and sometimes walking too close despite being outside (plus related uncertainty about the friend’s COVID test). Generated Answer includes (1) and (2) but полностью misses (3) and does not mention the specific exposure described in [P-20]/[D-21]/[P-21].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is partially grounded for the first two items ([D-43]) but contains a directly contradicted claim: it asserts there is no exposure/social contact information in the transcript, despite clear exposure history in [P-20]. This represents unfaithful use of the transcript (not merely an omission).",
    "relevance": "The response stays on the asked elements (condition, test, prompting contact detail) without tangential material. However, the third component is addressed in a way that denies relevant transcript content. Still, the content is topically aligned with the question."
