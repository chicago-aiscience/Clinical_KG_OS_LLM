  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fails to specify the internal order of the initial symptoms. In [P-4], the patient explicitly states she noticed the scratchy throat first, followed by the dry cough; the Generated Answer groups them together. Furthermore, the Generated Answer claims the feeling of heat 'followed' the respiratory symptoms and represented a 'subsequent change,' whereas the Gold Answer correctly notes that the transcript does not specify the exact day the heat began relative to the others, only that it occurred 'all the time' during the illness.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most symptoms (cough, throat, malaise, headache, fever) but misses 'fatigue,' which is included in the Gold Answer. It also misses the specific detail about the doctor's summary of 'a little bit of fever.'",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Knowledge Graph' to justify symptom associations, which is not present in the provided transcript or prompt. It also makes an unsupported inference that the fever was a 'subsequent' progression, while the transcript [P-9] suggests she felt hot 'all the time' (not necessarily starting after the cough).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to directly address the multi-part question regarding the timeline and relationship of symptoms."
