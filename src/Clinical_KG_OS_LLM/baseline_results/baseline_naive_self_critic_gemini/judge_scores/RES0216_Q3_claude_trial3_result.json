    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and misrepresentations. It incorrectly states the patient is 'currently prescribed Salbutamol (rescue inhaler)' when the transcript clearly shows the patient has NOT refilled the rescue inhaler in years [P-17, P-18]. It also misses the crucial medication non-adherence aspect - the patient skipping evening doses of maintenance therapy [P-19] - which was central to the doctor's reasoning [D-34]. The answer fabricates a quote about 'productive symptoms' [P-11] that doesn't align with what the patient actually said. While it correctly identifies asthma history and some symptoms, these major factual errors significantly undermine correctness.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: (1) The critical medication non-adherence pattern - specifically skipping evening maintenance doses [P-19] and failing to refill rescue inhaler [P-17, P-18], which the doctor explicitly summarized in D-34. (2) The patient's own acknowledgment that symptoms could be related to asthma despite feeling different [P-16]. (3) The exercise-induced worsening pattern [P-9, P-10]. (4) Absence of environmental triggers [P-33]. (5) The therapeutic trial rationale with bronchodilator response [D-35]. The answer covers basic elements like asthma history and chest tightness but misses approximately 50% of the key reasoning components.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple claims not supported by the transcript. It states the patient is 'currently prescribed Salbutamol (rescue inhaler)' when the patient explicitly said they haven't refilled it in years [P-17, P-18]. The statement about 'productive symptoms' being 'reported in the clinical record' appears fabricated - the patient only mentioned hoarseness and phlegm [P-11], not as formally documented features. The answer also mischaracterizes the medication history by listing Salbutamol as current medication when it's actually unavailable. While most claims are traceable to the transcript, these significant hallucinations reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by attempting to explain how symptoms, history, and clinical features led to the asthma diagnosis. It organizes the response into presenting symptoms, medical history, and doctor's reasoning as requested. However, it includes some less relevant details (like listing Ramipril for blood pressure without connecting it to the diagnosis) and misses the core reasoning about medication non-adherence. The structure is appropriate but the content drift and missing key links reduce overall relevance to what the question specifically asked about."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to address how the doctor identified asthma exacerbation as the top differential but contains significant factual errors, particularly regarding medication status and adherence. It incorrectly states the patient is currently prescribed and has access to rescue medication when the transcript clearly shows otherwise. The answer misses critical reasoning elements highlighted by the doctor, especially the medication non-adherence pattern that was explicitly summarized in D-34 and central to the diagnosis. While it correctly identifies asthma history and some presenting symptoms, it covers only about half the key points and includes fabricated claims about 'clinical record' documentation. The structure is relevant but the content lacks the depth and accuracy of the doctor's actual reasoning process."
