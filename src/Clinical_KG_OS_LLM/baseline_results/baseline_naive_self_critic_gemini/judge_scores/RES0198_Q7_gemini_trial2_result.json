  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It claims there is no evidence for which symptom appeared first, whereas the transcript explicitly states it 'felt pretty stuffy at first' [P-3]. It claims there was no change in predominance, contradicting [P-3] where the patient says 'but now it's mostly running.' Finally, it describes symptoms as 'intermittent' based on [P-1], ignoring the patient's later clarification in [P-8] that symptoms have been 'pretty constant for the past week.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to identify the sequence of symptoms and the shift in predominance which were core requirements of the prompt and well-documented in the Gold Answer. It also misses the context regarding the use of decongestants potentially affecting the symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a lack of evidence ('no specific evidence in the transcript indicating which symptom appeared first') when the transcript clearly contains this information in [P-3]. It also selectively uses the initial 'on and off' description while ignoring the direct clarification in [P-8] regarding the symptoms being constant.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it attempts to answer each specific part of the user's prompt (timing, first symptom, shift, and frequency), although the information provided is factually incorrect."
