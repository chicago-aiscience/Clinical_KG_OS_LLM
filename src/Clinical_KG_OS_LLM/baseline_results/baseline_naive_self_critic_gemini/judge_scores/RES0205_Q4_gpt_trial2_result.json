  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition ruled out and that a “covid test” was used (supported by P-35). However, it is incorrect about timing: the transcript explicitly states the test was done “when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago” (P-36). The Generated Answer instead claims the test was done during a prolonged period of symptom persistence, which contradicts the source and Gold Answer. Workplace concerns are partially correct (coworkers scared when patient coughs), but it omits other key workplace context (hospital setting, PPE/infection-control implications, staying home, and wanting to return without coughing).",
    "completeness": "Included: (1) COVID-19 ruled out, (2) COVID test used, (3) coworker fear about coughing.\nMissing/incorrect: (1) correct timing relative to onset (test at symptom onset ~2 weeks ago), (2) patient’s role in a hospital and the heightened infection-control context, (3) PPE mention, (4) patient stayed home after test, (5) desire/pressure to return to work not coughing and request for meds as related to work concerns. Overall captures less than half of the Gold Answer’s key elements and gets one key element (timing) wrong.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims about COVID being ruled out and coworkers being scared are grounded in the transcript (P-35). But the timing statement is not just unverifiable—it conflicts with P-36, which clearly places testing at symptom onset. The explanation about the test being done during prolonged symptoms is therefore unfaithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on the asked items (condition ruled out, test, timing, workplace concerns). The extra discussion of early symptom resolution is minor, but the timing section is still aimed at the question even though it is incorrect."
