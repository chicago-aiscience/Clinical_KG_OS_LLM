  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's timeline. It correctly identifies the headache and cough as the initial symptoms (4 days ago), diarrhea (2 days ago), vomiting/nausea (following diarrhea), and loss of smell (1 day ago). It also accurately states that the headache and cough remained stable/persistent in severity.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key requirements of the prompt: initial symptoms, relative timing of GI and sensory symptoms, and stability of headache/cough. However, it is slightly less comprehensive than the Gold Answer, as it omits specific clinical details such as the location of the headache (forehead/top), the frequency of diarrhea (5-6 times per day), the contents of the vomit, and the pertinent negatives (no fever).",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript. The citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-28], [P-24]) are accurate and align with the dialogue turns in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses each part of the specific multi-part question without adding unnecessary or off-topic information."
