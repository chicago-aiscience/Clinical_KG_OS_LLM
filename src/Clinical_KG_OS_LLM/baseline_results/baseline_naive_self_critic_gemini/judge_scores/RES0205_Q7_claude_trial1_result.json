  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It states mucus production lasted 'two or three days' when the Gold Answer clearly states 'four to five days' [P-6]. It also incorrectly states the cough transitioned 'within the first few days' when the Gold Answer specifies 'after approximately day four or five.' The Generated Answer omits key details like the specific 'whitish clear' mucus description, the specific timeline of sore throat (2-3 days) vs runny nose/flu symptoms (3-4 days), cough frequency (3-4 times per hour), stable intensity, and the COVID test timing.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) the 'whitish clear' mucus description, (2) the distinction between sore throat resolution (2-3 days) and other flu symptoms (3-4 days), (3) cough frequency quantification (3-4 times per hour), (4) stable intensity and frequency over time, (5) spontaneous occurrence with no triggers, (6) no fevers at any point, (7) COVID test at symptom onset, and (8) patient being home from work awaiting resolution. The timeline details requested in the question are incomplete and inaccurate.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes claims that contradict the transcript. The statement that mucus lasted 'two or three days' contradicts [P-6] which clearly states 'first four or five days.' The claim that the cough transitioned 'within the first few days' is imprecise given [P-6]'s specific timeline. The reference to [P-5], [P-13], [P-14] for productive cough timing is misleading as these don't establish the 2-3 day timeline claimed. Most critically, the answer invents a timeline not supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the main question about symptom progression timeline but does so incompletely. It attempts to cover the initial symptoms, resolution period, cough transition, and current status. However, it fails to provide the detailed timeline requested, particularly regarding 'how long the mucus production lasted' (incorrectly stated), 'what it looked like' (omitted), precise timing of the productive-to-dry transition (incorrectly stated), 'when other symptoms resolved' (partially addressed but imprecise), and 'how the cough's intensity and frequency changed over time' (largely omitted)."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to describe the symptom timeline but contains critical factual errors in the mucus production duration (claims 2-3 days vs actual 4-5 days) and cough transition timing. It omits essential details including mucus appearance ('whitish clear'), specific symptom resolution timelines, cough frequency (3-4 times/hour), stable intensity, COVID test information, and work absence details. The answer contradicts the source transcript on key timeline elements while missing approximately 50% of the relevant information requested in the question."
