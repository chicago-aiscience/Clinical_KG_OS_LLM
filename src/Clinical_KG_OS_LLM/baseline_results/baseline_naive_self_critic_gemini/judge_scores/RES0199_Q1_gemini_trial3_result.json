  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states that diarrhea began roughly 4 days ago, whereas the transcript [P-28] and the gold answer specify it began approximately 2 days ago. The rest of the facts regarding cough nature, diarrhea frequency, vomiting count, and headache severity are accurate.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the specific items requested in the prompt (nature of cough, frequency of diarrhea, number of vomiting episodes, and headache severity). However, it misses several key clinical details present in the gold answer, such as the absence of sputum/blood, pertinent negatives (no shortness of breath, wheezing, bloating, or constipation), the specific location of the headache, the presence of nausea, the loss of smell, and fatigue.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that diarrhea started 4 days ago is not supported by the transcript; the patient explicitly states 'probably like 2 days ago' [P-28]. The rest of the answer is well-grounded in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific symptoms and characteristics requested in the prompt."
