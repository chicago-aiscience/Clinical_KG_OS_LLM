  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer's stated diagnosis ('most likely a viral infection like the common cold'), supportive care (hydration and OTC like Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (swab for COVID with 48-hour results), and public health guidance (isolation at home until results, then public health instructions). It correctly notes the pandemic context and symptom overlap with COVID, which aligns with the transcript and Gold without introducing errors. No factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnosis (viral cold), supportive care (well hydrated, OTC Tylenol Cold), diagnostic swab ordered with 48-hour results, public health isolation and further instructions. Missed: explicit mention of 'takes a few weeks for symptoms to resolve,' 'not much that we can do besides supportive care,' and swab 'today.' Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-39]: diagnosis, hydration, Tylenol Cold, pandemic/COVID symptoms, swab today (inferred as ordered now), 48 hours, isolation, public health follow-up. No hallucinations; citations accurate. 'Knowledge graph' reference is extraneous but does not fabricate plan details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to match question sections (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance) with no off-topic content or tangents."
