  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly links the missed anti-epileptic dose (Keppra) to the seizure and correctly cites the patient’s own statement in P-9 (“I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have...”) as evidence that the patient suspected causality. However, it introduces an external “Knowledge Graph” claim and frames the missed dose as a confirmed precipitating factor “according to the Knowledge Graph,” which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer framing (the Gold emphasizes this is the patient’s inference, with no clinician confirmation).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) missed Keppra dose temporally linked to seizure, (2) evidence of patient recognizing the link via P-9 quote. \nKey points missed: (1) the fact the patient volunteered this attribution in response to a question not directly about adherence (D-9 context), (2) the patient’s statement that seizures are usually infrequent (P-9) supporting that this was unusual/triggered, (3) the detailed situational reason for the missed dose (daughter’s birthday/disrupted dinner routine in P-24), and (4) explicit note that there is no clinician assessment confirming causality—only patient recognition.",
    "faithfulness": "The P-9 quotation and the fact the patient takes Keppra (P-23) are grounded in the transcript. But the statement “According to the Knowledge Graph… forgot medication --[PRECIPITATES]--> seizure” is not supported anywhere in the transcript and constitutes hallucinated/external content. Also, describing the missed dose as definitively “acting as a precipitating factor” goes beyond what is explicitly established (it is the patient’s suspected cause).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question: it explains how the missed dose relates to the seizure and identifies transcript evidence that the patient recognized the link (P-9). The added ‘Knowledge Graph’ reference is unnecessary but does not substantially derail the answer."
