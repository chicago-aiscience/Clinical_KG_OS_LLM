  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error by stating that the transcript does not document a change in taste. Turn [P-17] in the transcript explicitly records the mother saying, 'I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit.' Additionally, it cites the duration as 'five days' based on the doctor's initial assumption [D-3], whereas the parent corrected this to '3 days' in [P-4].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses one of the three specific symptoms requested in the prompt (change in taste) by incorrectly claiming it was not documented. It successfully covers the respiratory complaint, the fever, and the doctor's reasoning regarding an infectious process vs. asthma.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness regarding the 'change in taste' symptom, hallucinating its absence despite it being present in Turn [P-17]. It is faithful to the doctor's logic in turn [D-45] regarding the exclusion of asthma.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured well to address the prompt's requirements, though its utility is hampered by the incorrect dismissal of the taste symptom."
