  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details dry cough onset 4-5 days prior as first symptom, non-productive throughout, severity unchanged ('stayed the same'), runny nose 'couple of days' later with clear discharge, sequential progression, and prior history of no similar dry cough with shorter prior runny noses. Generated Answer correctly captures cough onset 4-5 days, precedes runny nose (quantified durations), persistent/not improving severity matching 'stayed the same', clear runny nose; however, omits explicit dry/non-productive nature and precise prior comparison (never had dry cough like this, runny noses shorter). Minor discrepancies like incomplete prior details and citation error ([P-5] for duration instead of [P-2/P-4]), but core facts accurate. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: cough 4-5 days first/dry/non-productive; severity same; runny couple days later/clear; sequential; prior novel dry cough, shorter past runny noses, healthy/no SOB. Covered: cough onset/timing before runny (100%), severity persistent (yes), runny clear (yes). Missed/partial: dry/non-productive (implied not stated), exact prior phrasing (P-24), focuses on asthma instead. Adds extras (other symptoms denial). Covers ~80-90% core timeline/severity/relative timing/prior. Score: 4.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: cough 4-5 days [P-2/P-4], runny couple days [P-11], precedes [sequence D-8/P-11], persistent [P-2], clear [P-12], no other symptoms cited accurately [P-9 etc.], prior asthma workup [P-28]. Minor citation inaccuracy ([P-5] for duration, but fact correct from elsewhere). No hallucinations, fully grounded. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses timeline (onset/sequence cough vs runny), durations/relative timing, cough severity trend, prior comparison. Minor tangents: lists unrelated symptom denials (sore throat etc.), asthma family hx (tangential to prior symptoms). Mostly focused on question. Score: 4."
