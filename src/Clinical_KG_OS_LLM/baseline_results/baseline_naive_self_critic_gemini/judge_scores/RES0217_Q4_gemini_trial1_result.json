  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the clinical features (bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/illness, and headaches) and two of the primary diagnostic tests (tick identification and blood work). However, it labels the review of the 'distribution map' as a diagnostic test, whereas the Gold Answer treats this as part of the geographic/epidemiological assessment. It also misses the 'physical examination' mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers most key points but misses two specific elements mentioned in the Gold Answer: the physical examination of the bite site and the plan to consult a supervising physician before finalizing the plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript, providing correct citations for the symptoms and tests mentioned. No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the prompt (clinical features and diagnostic tests) in a clear, structured format."
