  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details initial headache and cough 4 days ago, stable severity for both, specific GI timings (diarrhea 2 days ago, vomiting yesterday/nausea today, 'few days back'), anosmia 1 day ago, headache location/atypical, negatives. Generated accurately captures initial onset, GI ~2 days/few days, anosmia 1 day, cough stable/dry, headache persistent/7/10 but omits explicit 'stayed the same' severity for headache [P-9], headache details/location/atypical, precise vomiting details, and negatives. Minor discrepancies in GI ordering and omissions, but core facts (timings, first symptoms, stability) match; no contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 4-day progression, initial H/C 4 days [P-1/2], H persistent/bilateral/7/10/stable/atypical, C dry/stable, GI diarrhea 2d/5-6x [P-28], N/V few days/vom yest 2x food/nausea today [P-1/32/34], anosmia 1d [P-24], negatives. Generated covers: initial H/C 4d simultaneous, diarrhea 2d, N/V few days shortly after, anosmia 1d, H persistent/7/10, C stable/dry. Misses: H location [P-5]/atypical [P-10]/explicit stable [P-9], diarrhea freq, precise V timing/details, nausea today, negatives. Covers ~85% of key points, strong on question-specific elements (progression, timings, stability).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated verifiable in transcript: initial [P-1], diarrhea [P-28], N/V [P-1/P-32], anosmia [P-24], H persistent [P-3]/7/10 [P-8], C stable [P-11]/dry [P-12]. Citations accurate. 'Shortly thereafter' for N/V after diarrhea is plausible from [P-1] sequence ('then... nausea/vomiting... as well as diarrhea'), no fabrication or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around illness development (initial onset, secondary timings for GI/anosmia relative to initial, stability of H/C), perfectly matching question without tangents or off-topic content."
