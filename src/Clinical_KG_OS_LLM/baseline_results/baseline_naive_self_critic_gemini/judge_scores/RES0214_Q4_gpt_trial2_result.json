  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies the ordered test as a COVID-19 swab, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-53].\n- Correctly captures the main rationale for prioritizing COVID-19: the husband’s similar symptoms suggesting a household transmission context and that COVID is the “first thing” to rule out [P-19, D-53].\n- Adds an inference that the patient “likely contracted the virus from him,” which is not stated verbatim but is broadly consistent with the clinician’s framing (“if your husband got it, and you have it…”).\n- Does not include the Gold Answer’s point that influenza was raised only after COVID rule-out was discussed and after learning she did not get a flu shot; this omission doesn’t make what is said wrong, but it leaves out a key comparative rationale element.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points vs. Generated Answer:\n- COVID-19 swab ordered: Covered.\n- Priority due to household transmission pattern (husband ill, patient then ill): Covered.\n- Emphasis on infectiousness/containment with self-isolation while ruling out COVID: Partially covered (mentions need for self-isolation, but does not clearly reflect the transcript’s explicit containment/“until we rule out covid” reasoning [D-53, D-54]).\n- Influenza mentioned as secondary/after COVID discussion and linked to lack of flu shot: Missed.\nOverall: covers the central reason (household/epidemiology) but misses the flu-shot/influenza sequencing detail and only partially captures the explicit containment rationale.",
    "faithfulness": "- The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations for the COVID swab and household-symptom rationale.\n- However, it introduces “the knowledge graph” and claims it “supports” links between symptoms and COVID risk; no knowledge graph exists in the provided transcript. These are unverifiable additions.\n- The rest is largely consistent with transcript content, but the “knowledge graph” references reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "- Directly answers both parts of the question (test ordered and rationale for prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza).\n- Minor irrelevant/extra content appears in references to a “knowledge graph,” which is not needed to answer the question."
