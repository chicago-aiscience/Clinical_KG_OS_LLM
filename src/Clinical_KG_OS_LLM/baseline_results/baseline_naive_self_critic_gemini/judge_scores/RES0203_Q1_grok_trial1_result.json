  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms of diminished smell (partial loss), loss of taste, and mild dry cough, matching the Gold Answer's symptoms. However, it inaccurately describes the taste loss as 'complete' despite the Gold Answer and transcript [P-4] specifying it as partial (can taste very salty foods but not normal things like banana). It also omits duration (two days), consistency, and specific perception details. This constitutes a significant factual error on the degree of taste loss and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: three symptoms (decreased smell, loss of taste, mild dry cough) all for two days; smell partial (can smell really bad odors); taste partial (can taste really salty, cannot taste banana/normal things); both sensory deficits consistent; cough mild/dry/non-productive/no sputum/blood, consistent, started same time, no triggers. Generated covers symptoms and partial smell/mild cough but misses duration, consistency, specific perception details for smell/taste, full cough details (dry confirmation, non-productive, timing, triggers). Covers roughly 20-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims for smell partial and cough mild are verifiable [P-1]. Taste loss as 'complete' is not verifiable and contradicted by [P-4] (partial, specifics on salty/banana); ignores later clarifications. Uses terms 'Anosmia/Ageusia' not in transcript but medically appropriate. Citations limited to [P-1], missing [P-4, P-6, P-7, P-8]. Includes hallucinated 'complete' taste loss.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists sensory (smell, taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms with degrees of impairment (partial/complete) and cites transcript, perfectly matching the question's focus without off-topic content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is relevant but marred by a major factual error claiming complete taste loss (contradicting partial per Gold/transcript), incomplete coverage of details/degrees/duration, and poor faithfulness due to ungrounded claims."
