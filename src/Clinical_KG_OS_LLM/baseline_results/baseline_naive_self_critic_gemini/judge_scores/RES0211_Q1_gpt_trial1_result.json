  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several reported symptoms over 3–4 days (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, feeling generally unwell/crappy, feeling hot) and correctly notes denial of shortness of breath and lack of sputum/phlegm (though it relies on a definition rather than citing her explicit denial). However, it contains a clear factual error by claiming that nausea, joint pain, and rashes were “not mentioned” in the transcript—these were explicitly asked about and denied (nausea/vomiting, joint aches, and rashes/skin changes). It also adds “congestion”/post-nasal drip, which is mentioned but framed in the allergy discussion and is not clearly part of the 3–4 day acute symptom set emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Reported symptoms: includes dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, feeling crappy/malaise, feeling hot; misses “icky,” persistent day/night heat description, and tiredness. \nDenied symptoms: includes sputum/phlegm (implicitly) and shortness of breath; misses explicit denials of rashes/skin changes, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and joint aches. Overall, it captures a minority of the required denied symptoms and omits multiple key negatives from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded in the transcript (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, feeling hot, post-nasal drip/plugged up, denial of breathing difficulty). But it makes an ungrounded/incorrect claim that nausea/joint pain/rashes were not mentioned, which directly contradicts the transcript. It also introduces an extraneous “Knowledge Graph definition” justification for fever not present in the transcript. These issues reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly focused on the patient’s reported symptoms and denied symptoms, which is what the question asks. However, it introduces minor tangents (e.g., “Knowledge Graph” definition; congestion/post-nasal drip) and incorrectly dismisses symptoms that were explicitly denied in the interview."
