  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript does not include historical context or baseline usage data. The transcript explicitly states the patient was diagnosed at age eight [P-2] and previously used the bronchodilator 'once every two weeks' [P-8]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these points, which the Generated Answer denies exist.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the entire temporal evolution requested in the prompt. It fails to mention the age of diagnosis (8), the current age (10), and the baseline usage frequency (once every two weeks). It only covers the current exacerbation symptoms, missing more than half of the key points found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript because it claims the required information is missing when it is clearly present. While the description of current symptoms is grounded in the text, the overall framing of the answer is based on a false premise about the source content.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer only partially addresses the question. It describes the 'current' state but explicitly refuses to address the 'evolution over time' from diagnosis and baseline, which was the central focus of the prompt. This makes it largely unresponsive to the 'how did it evolve' aspect of the question."
