  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies sore throat (4 days, very sore), difficulty swallowing food while tolerating fluids, muscle aches, fatigue/tiredness, and that the patient did not lose smell. However, it contains a major error/misinterpretation regarding taste: the transcript indicates a reduced sense of taste starting ~2 days prior and constant (not that the patient “has not lost” taste). It also omits a major active symptom: difficulty breathing that began yesterday, is constant, and worsening. Because it misses/incorrectly characterizes key clinical facts compared with the Gold Answer, correctness is substantially reduced.",
    "completeness": "Key reported symptoms in the Gold Answer: (1) sore throat with worsening and dysphagia; (2) difficulty breathing (onset yesterday, constant, worsening, new); (3) reduced taste (2 days, constant); (4) fatigue and myalgias (after sore throat onset, tired but not weak). The Generated Answer covers sore throat and dysphagia, fatigue and myalgias, but misses the breathing symptom entirely and mishandles the taste symptom.\nKey explicit denials in the Gold Answer: cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell, fever, chills/night sweats (plus denies sick contacts and travel). The Generated Answer only lists loss of smell and omits all other denials. Overall coverage is well under 50% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are drawn from the transcript (sore throat timing, dysphagia, myalgias, tiredness, no smell). The main unfaithful element is the claim implying the patient “confirmed they have not lost their taste,” which contradicts the transcript where the patient reports reduced taste. The answer is also selectively incomplete, but incompleteness alone is not hallucination; the primary faithfulness issue is the inaccurate taste interpretation.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question (symptoms experienced and symptoms denied) and does not introduce irrelevant topics. However, it fails to address many of the specifically asked-about commonly screened symptoms (cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell) beyond smell, which reduces how well it answers the question, though what it does include is on-topic."
