  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details onset as 4-5 days with wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths (P-2), triggered by playing tag (P-3), fluctuating episodes resolving with rest and recurring with activity (P-5/P-6), recent slight non-productive cough after wheezing (P-1/P-31), single nocturnal wheeziness with trouble falling asleep (P-43/P-44), and negatives (no fever P-7, no cyanosis P-32, fine otherwise P-9). Generated Answer correctly captures 4-5 day onset with wheezing, activity trigger (tag P-3), fluctuating pattern with rest resolution and activity recurrence (P-6), cough emergence (P-1), and nocturnal episode (P-43/P-44). Minor discrepancies: cough timing as 'alongside' vs. after wheezing; adds colder weather (P-38, factual but not initial trigger); omits deep breaths specificity and negatives. Core facts consistent, no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: onset/timing (P-1), trigger/activity (P-3), wheezing/SOB, fluctuating/episodic detail (P-5/P-6), cough (P-1), nocturnal (P-43/P-44). Missed/partial: specific 'difficulty taking deep breaths' (P-2), cough as non-productive/no phlegm (P-31), precise 'after wheezing established', negatives (no fever P-7, cyanosis P-32, fine otherwise P-9). Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: onset/wheezing (P-1), trigger (P-3), fluctuating (P-5/P-6), cough (P-1), nocturnal (P-43/P-44), colder weather (P-38). Hallucinations: 'clinical knowledge graph' mentioned twice supporting progression, cough coexistence, and sleep disturbances—not in transcript. SOB directly cited to P-6 (inferred but primarily P-2/P-3). Multiple unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response around question elements (onset/trigger, cough emergence, fluctuating pattern, nocturnal episode) with no off-topic content; minor additions like weather are contextually relevant to triggers."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is mostly correct and complete in describing symptom progression but is undermined by hallucinated references to a 'clinical knowledge graph' and minor omissions of details like cough non-productivity and pertinent negatives."
