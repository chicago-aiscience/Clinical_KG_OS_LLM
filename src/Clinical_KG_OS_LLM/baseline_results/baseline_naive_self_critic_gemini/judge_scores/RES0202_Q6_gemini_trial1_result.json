  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the assessment (infection/COVID-19), the diagnostic test (COVID swab) with its turnaround time (24-48 hours), the isolation period (14 days), the potential for false negatives, the alternative diagnosis (viral illness), and the specific warning signs (high temperature, seizures, weakness, dizziness, and fainting).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points from the gold answer. It misses two minor details: the specific mention of isolating from the younger sister if possible, and the concluding summary point that no medications were prescribed and the approach was watchful waiting. However, it captures all the specific requirements of the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript, with accurate citations to the specific dialogue turns (D-44, D-45). It does not contain any hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and comprehensively addresses all parts of the multi-part question, following a clear structure that makes the information easy to find."
