  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's suspicion of COVID-19 due to symptom overlap as stated in [D-52] and lists key symptoms including persistent headache [P-3], cough [P-1], nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [P-1, P-32], which align with the Gold Answer's core facts. It accurately highlights loss of smell [P-24] as the characteristic symptom. Minor discrepancies include not specifying the cough as dry [P-12], omitting fatigue [P-19], and not mentioning pertinent negatives like no fever [P-18] or no runny nose [P-23], but no contradictions or major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: doctor's explicit statement [D-52], main symptom combination (headache, cough, GI symptoms), loss of smell as characteristic [P-24]. Missed or partially covered: specific dry cough [P-12], fatigue [P-19], doctor's question on smell/taste [D-24], alternative viral illness [D-52], pertinent negatives (no fever/chills [P-18], no runny nose [P-23], no aches [P-27]). Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: symptom onset and details [P-1, P-3], doctor's suspicion [D-52], loss of smell [P-24]. Citations are accurate (e.g., [P-24], [D-52]). No hallucinated facts; cough described generally but matches transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question by structuring the response into the specific symptom combination leading to COVID-19 suspicion and the characteristic symptom (loss of smell), with no off-topic content."
