  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error regarding the frequency of Ventolin usage. It claims the transcript does not provide a specific numerical frequency, whereas the patient explicitly states in [P-12] that they used it 'almost like 10 times this past week'. It correctly identifies the respiratory and non-respiratory medications and the discontinued blood pressure medication.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide the specific frequency of Ventolin usage requested in the prompt, which is a key component of the Gold Answer. It also omits the specific detail that the blood pressure medication was a diuretic and the patient's rationale for stopping it (well-controlled blood pressure), both of which were included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness by stating the transcript lacks information that is clearly present ([P-12]). This is a hallucination of absence. The other medication details are grounded correctly in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in its structure, addressing each part of the multi-part question directly, even though one part was answered incorrectly."
