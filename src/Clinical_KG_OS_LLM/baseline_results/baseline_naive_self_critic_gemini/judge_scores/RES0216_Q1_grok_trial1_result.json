  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies chest tightness and dyspnea/shortness of breath as present symptoms with appropriate citations, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it adds asthma history and worry/concern as 'reported symptoms,' which are not current symptoms per the Gold. It inaccurately lists 'Shortness of Breath with Exercise' as explicitly denied based on the doctor's paraphrase [D-36], contradicting the patient's reports of worsening on walks [P-1, P-9]. It misses upper airway symptoms (hoarseness, phlegm, throat clearing) and falsely claims no explicit patient denials for fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, and cough, despite clear 'No' responses [P-11 to P-15]. These are significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: chest tightness (partial details), dyspnea (partial). Missed: full details on tightness (diffuse, worse on inspiration/exertion specifics like chair/deep breath), upper airway (hoarse, phlegm, throat clearing), explicit denials of anxiety/sweating/impending doom [P-6], fevers [P-12], night sweats [P-13], chills [P-14], weight loss [P-15], cough [P-11]. Only covers chest tightness/dyspnea (~40% of present) and 1/8 denied accurately. ~30-40% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on chest tightness and dyspnea verifiable [P-1, P-5, P-7, P-9]. Asthma history and worry verifiable but not core symptoms. 'Denied SOB with exercise' not verifiable as patient denial (doctor's interpretation [D-36], patient affirmed dyspnea on exertion). False statement that transcript lacks explicit denials for fevers etc. (directly contradicted by P-11-P-15). Multiple unverifiable/misrepresented claims.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response around 'Reported Symptoms' and 'Explicitly Denied Symptoms' matching the question's request for present symptoms (respiratory/upper airway/chest) and denied screened symptoms (fevers, night sweats, etc.). Minor tangents like asthma history and worry, but focused overall."
