  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the main reasons for prophylaxis that match the Gold Answer: (1) outdoor exposure from hiking Friday and gardening Saturday, (2) physician-estimated attachment duration >72 hours, (3) Strathroy assessed as a concerning Lyme-risk area via an Ontario distribution map, and (4) prior tick bite ~10 years ago with target/bullseye rash treated with antibiotics. \nMinor issue: it characterizes the prior episode as “known susceptibility (prior reaction),” which is an inference not explicitly stated by the clinician; the transcript supports prior Lyme-like illness but not necessarily increased biologic susceptibility. Otherwise, no direct contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: exposure history (hiking/gardening and uncertainty of when acquired), estimated duration >72 hours, geographic risk (Strathroy/creek + map concern), prior bullseye rash history, and acknowledgement that current tick didn’t resemble deer tick and no current bullseye rash.\nKey elements partially/omitted: the patient’s statement that “all ticks in this area” may be carriers (contextual risk perception), the clinician’s plan to send the tick to a lab for species ID, and the explicit “safer than not” rationale language. Overall, it captures the core combination but misses a few supporting risk-context points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by transcript citations. Two minor faithfulness concerns: (1) “knowledge graph information” is not in the transcript, and (2) “known susceptibility” is not explicitly stated (it’s an interpretive gloss on prior Lyme-like episode). No major hallucinated events or locations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by describing the combination of exposure history, attachment-duration estimate, geographic risk assessment, and prior tick-bite/bullseye history that led to prophylactic antibiotics despite lack of deer-tick appearance and no current rash. No meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate and on-target, capturing the main risk factors prompting prophylaxis, with minor omissions (all-ticks-possible-carrier context, lab ID plan, ‘safer than not’ phrasing) and slight interpretive overreach about ‘susceptibility.’"
