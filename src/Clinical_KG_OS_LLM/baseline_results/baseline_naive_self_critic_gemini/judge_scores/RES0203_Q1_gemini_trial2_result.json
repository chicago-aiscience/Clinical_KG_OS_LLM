{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly characterizes the loss of taste as 'complete.' In the transcript (P-4), the patient explicitly states that they can still taste 'really, really salty foods' and that the loss is not total, which the Gold Answer correctly identifies as partial. Additionally, while it labels smell loss as partial, it fails to provide the supporting facts from the Gold Answer regarding what the patient could still perceive.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all specific details requested in the prompt. It fails to mention that the patient can still smell 'really bad' odors, can taste 'salty foods' but not 'bananas,' that the cough is non-productive (no sputum/blood), the duration of two days, and the absence of triggers.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims a 'complete loss' of taste based on P-1, but ignores the clarification in P-4 where the patient describes partial perception. This results in a claim that is contradicted by the source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer identifies the three symptoms but fails to follow the specific instruction to 'include any details the patient provided about what they could and could not still perceive.' It provides a high-level summary instead of the requested detail."
