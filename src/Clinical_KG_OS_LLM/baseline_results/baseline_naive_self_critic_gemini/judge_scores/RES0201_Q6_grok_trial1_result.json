  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment that symptoms are consistent with COVID-19 (paraphrasing 'in line with common symptoms' from [D-43]), lists both diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray) with appropriate purposes grounded in the transcript, and precisely details isolation instructions including continuation even if negative if symptomatic—all matching the Gold Answer's facts without contradictions or errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points: assessment phrasing, both tests with purposes, full isolation instructions (until results and continued if symptomatic post-negative), and conditions for isolation. Misses minor Gold details like explicit relevance to breathing difficulty/COPD, 'heads up' framing, consulting supervising doctor, and patient acknowledgment (80-99% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-43] (assessment, tests, isolation details); symptom specifics (sore throat, swallowing) from earlier transcript; no hallucinations, accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured and focused on the question's elements (assessment, plan, tests, isolation instructions/conditions); no irrelevant content."
