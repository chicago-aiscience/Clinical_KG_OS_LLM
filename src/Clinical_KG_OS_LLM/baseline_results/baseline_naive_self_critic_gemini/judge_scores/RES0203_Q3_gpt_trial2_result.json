  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptom combination (loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough) that prompted COVID-19 suspicion, matching P-1 and the clinician summary around D-16/D-39. It accurately states the doctor explicitly linked the symptoms to COVID-19 in D-39 and that the chosen diagnostic method was a swab test (D-39). No clinically meaningful contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "It covers the central Gold Answer elements: (1) key symptom triad (smell loss, taste loss, dry cough), (2) physician’s explicit linkage to common COVID symptoms (D-39), and (3) ordering a swab test (D-39). It omits additional supporting context highlighted in the Gold Answer—namely that the doctor elicited/confirmed absence of other symptoms (fever, dyspnea, sore throat, chest pain) and the emphasis on self-isolation while awaiting results—though those are more contextual than strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The clinical claims are grounded in the transcript (P-1, D-39). However, referencing a 'knowledge graph' and stating the swab method 'aligns with the procedure indicated in the knowledge graph' introduces unverifiable meta-information not present in the transcript. This is minor and does not affect the core clinical content.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses which symptoms led to suspicion and explains the clinician’s reasoning and the test method (swab). It stays on-topic with no significant tangents."
