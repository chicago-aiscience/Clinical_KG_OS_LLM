  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the overall symptom duration (1.5 weeks from P-2/P-6), episode duration (20 minutes from P-6), and partial quality (uncomfortable/odd from P-2, sharp/strong on deep breath though incorrectly cited to P-2 instead of P-3). Occurrence situations (studying/walking from P-4) are accurate. However, it introduces significant errors: resolution is misrepresented as not resolving without intervention (meds ineffective per P-6, but contradicts transcript/Gold where it resolves socially per P-9/P-29); falsely links pain to anxiety attacks (P-20 refers to palpitations, not pain); omits/misstates no worsening with exercise (P-10), at rest (D-11), no injury (P-5), first occurrence (P-17). These contradictions on key question elements (especially resolve) warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Covered from Gold: overall ~1.5 weeks duration, quality as uncomfortable/odd/sharp-strong-deep-breath, episode duration ~20 min intermittent (partial via frequency), occurrence when studying/walking alone (partial, misses 'alone' emphasis). Missed: resolves/goes unnoticed when engaged socially/talking/hands-on (P-9/P-29), occurs at rest (D-11), not worse with exercise/walking same (P-10), no injury (P-5), first time (P-17). Covers ~40% of key points, score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: durations/quality base in P-2/P-6 (sharp citation inaccurate to P-2); occurrence P-4; frequency D-18. However, resolution claim ('does not resolve without intervention') misinterprets P-6 (meds) ignoring P-9 self-resolution socially; anxiety-pain correlation hallucinated (P-20 is palpitations); 'not strictly exertion' interpretive ok but adds unverified. Multiple misinterpretations/hallucinations, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around quality, duration of episodes, occurrence/resolution situations as per question; extras like frequency/meds/anxiety are minor tangents but overall focused, score 4."
