  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains some correct information but has a significant factual error. It correctly identifies viral symptoms (stuffy/runny nose), the doctor's conclusion, and mentions absence of systemic features. However, it incorrectly states that symptoms are 'explicitly associated with viral illness in the provided knowledge graph' when no such knowledge graph exists in the transcript. The Gold Answer provides specific evidence against allergic and bacterial causes that the Generated Answer lacks.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions symptom type and the doctor's conclusion but omits critical details: (1) clear discharge quality as evidence, (2) one-week duration fitting viral URI timing, (3) symptom progression pattern, (4) specific evidence against allergic etiology (no exposure to allergens, no allergies, no prior episodes), (5) specific evidence against bacterial etiology (no fever, no headache, clear vs colored discharge), and (6) daycare exposure as plausible viral source.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a notable hallucination by referencing a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the transcript [Knowledge Graph]. All other claims are verifiable in the transcript, including the doctor's conclusion [D-39], symptom inquiries [D-7, D-14, D-16], and pandemic context. The hallucinated reference undermines the overall faithfulness despite most content being grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question but not comprehensively. It correctly identifies evidence supporting viral infection (symptoms, doctor's conclusion, absent features) but fails to adequately address why allergic or bacterial causes were ruled out, which was explicitly requested in the question. The pandemic context, while mentioned in transcript, is somewhat tangential to the core differential diagnosis question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question by identifying some evidence for viral infection (symptom type, doctor's conclusion, absent systemic features) but has significant gaps. It covers only ~40-50% of key points from the Gold Answer, notably omitting clear discharge quality, duration details, symptom progression, and specific evidence against allergic (no allergen exposure, no allergies) and bacterial (no fever, clear discharge) causes. A significant factual error involves referencing a non-existent 'knowledge graph.' While mostly grounded in the transcript, this hallucination and incomplete coverage of the differential diagnosis reasoning lower the overall quality."
