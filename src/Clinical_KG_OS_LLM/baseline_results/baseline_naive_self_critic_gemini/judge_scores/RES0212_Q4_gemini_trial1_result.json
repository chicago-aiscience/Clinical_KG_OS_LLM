  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it claims that night sweats and weight loss were 'not explicitly screened for by the doctor in the provided text.' However, the transcript shows the doctor clearly asking about night sweats (D-5) and unexplained weight loss (D-6). It also identifies chest pain as a primary symptom screened, which is not a constitutional symptom.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer regarding constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis) and completely ignores exposure risks (sick contacts, travel history, and IV drug use). It focuses on secondary symptoms like nausea and stiff neck while omitting the 'classic' screening questions for TB.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of information in the transcript. By stating that night sweats and weight loss were not screened, it directly contradicts the source text (D-5, D-6).",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the question of screening for TB, it fails to provide the 'specific constitutional symptoms and exposure risks' requested, instead providing systemic or focal symptoms like nausea and stiff neck."
