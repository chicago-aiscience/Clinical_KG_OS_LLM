  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links acid reflux to potential incomplete control due to dietary management only, which Generated covers accurately with clinical explanation of GERD-cough link. Hay fever noted by Gold as history without current symptoms/active role, but Generated assumes ongoing post-nasal drip contribution (minor overstatement). Occupational exposure matches Gold's infectious risk despite PPE. Generated adds plausible mechanisms consistent with core facts; minor discrepancies like assuming active hay fever role.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: acid reflux (history, dietary mgmt, no meds, potential contributor) - fully covered; hay fever (history, no current symptoms) - covered but misses 'no active contribution'; occupational (hospital risk, PPE careful) - covered; post-viral pattern - covered; anxiety context - missed. Covers ~90% of key points including citations and nuances.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like cough details [P-5/14], history [P-22/25/27/34], PPE [P-17], COVID [P-35] verifiable. Clinical explanations (GERD-cough, post-nasal drip) plausible but not in transcript. 'Knowledge Graph' reference entirely fabricated/not in transcript (hallucination). Assumes ongoing post-nasal drip despite dry cough now [P-5]. Some unverifiable but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three specified factors (acid reflux, hay fever, occupational), explains contributions to persistent cough, includes relevant transcript details and summary; no off-topic content."
