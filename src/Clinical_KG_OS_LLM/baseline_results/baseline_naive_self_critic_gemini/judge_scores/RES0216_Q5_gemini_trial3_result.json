  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain information about the patient skipping their evening dose or failing to refill their rescue inhaler. These facts are explicitly stated in the transcript: P-17 and P-18 discuss the failure to refill the rescue inhaler, and P-19 and P-20 discuss skipping the evening maintenance dose. By denying these facts, the Generated Answer fails to explain the relationship requested by the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses the majority of the key points from the Gold Answer. It focuses only on the general diagnosis of asthma recurrence but fails to address the specific behavioral factors (medication non-adherence and lack of rescue medication) that the prompt specifically asked to be linked to the symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination regarding the absence of information. It explicitly states that specific details are missing when they are clearly present in the provided source text. Additionally, it refers to a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. While it addresses the link between asthma and the symptoms, it explicitly refuses to address the parts of the question concerning the evening dose and the rescue inhaler, which were central to the prompt."
