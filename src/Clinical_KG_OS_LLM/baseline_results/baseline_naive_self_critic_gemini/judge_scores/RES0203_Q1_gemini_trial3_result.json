  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies the loss of taste as 'complete.' In transcript segment [P-4], the patient explicitly states they can still taste 'really, really salty foods,' indicating a partial loss. The Gold Answer correctly identifies both smell and taste loss as partial.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to include the specific details requested in the prompt regarding what the patient 'could and could not still perceive' (e.g., strong bad smells, salty foods, and bananas). It also misses the duration (two days) and the consistency of the symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is partially faithful as it quotes [P-1], but it ignores the clarifying information in [P-4]. By characterizing the taste loss as 'complete,' it misrepresents the patient's actual statement in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the specific categories of symptoms (sensory and respiratory) but fails to follow the secondary instruction to include details about perception."
