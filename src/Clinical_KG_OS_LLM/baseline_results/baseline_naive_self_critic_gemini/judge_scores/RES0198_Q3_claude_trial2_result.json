  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer identifies some correct points such as nasal symptoms, clear discharge, absent systemic features, and viral diagnosis. However, it contains significant errors: (1) It incorrectly cites a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not exist in the transcript, (2) It mischaracterizes the pandemic context as 'high-exposure environment' when the doctor simply acknowledged COVID as a differential requiring testing, (3) It fails to mention critical distinguishing features explicitly stated in the gold answer - clear discharge quality, one-week duration, symptom progression pattern, absence of allergies/exposures, and daycare exposure source.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers approximately 40-50% of key points from the gold answer. It captures: viral diagnosis conclusion, absence of systemic symptoms, and general symptom type. However, it omits: specific discharge quality ('mostly clear'), precise duration (one week), symptom progression (stuffiness to runny), absence of fever/headache ruling out bacterial cause, no allergy history/exposures ruling out allergic cause, decongestant response, daycare exposure context, and typical viral URI timing. These omissions represent substantial gaps in the clinical reasoning chain.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a significant hallucination - referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' and '[Knowledge Graph]' citation that does not exist anywhere in the source transcript. While most other claims can be traced to the transcript (nasal symptoms, absent features, doctor's conclusion), this fabricated reference undermines faithfulness. The characterization of 'high-exposure environment' is an interpretation not directly stated in the transcript, though the pandemic context is mentioned.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question about evidence supporting viral over allergic/bacterial causes, but does so incompletely. It focuses primarily on symptom presence and absence without adequately distinguishing between viral versus allergic versus bacterial etiologies as the question specifically asks. The pandemic discussion is tangential - COVID testing was mentioned as precautionary, not as primary diagnostic reasoning for common cold diagnosis."

  "summary": "The generated answer addresses the question but has significant deficiencies across all dimensions. It contains a major hallucination (non-existent 'Knowledge Graph'), omits critical diagnostic details (discharge quality, duration, progression pattern, specific exposures), and fails to clearly distinguish why features pointed specifically to viral rather than allergic or bacterial causes. While it correctly identifies the doctor's viral diagnosis conclusion and some supporting absent features, the incomplete coverage and fabricated citation substantially undermine its quality. The answer achieves partial relevance but lacks the clinical reasoning depth present in the gold answer."
