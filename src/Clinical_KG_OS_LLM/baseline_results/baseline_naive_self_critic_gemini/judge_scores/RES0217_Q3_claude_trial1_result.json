  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key factual elements from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: (1) the exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), (2) the >72-hour attachment duration estimate, (3) the Strathroy geographic location and risk assessment via distribution map, and (4) the prior tick bite with bullseye rash ~10 years ago requiring antibiotics. The answer correctly notes the tick did not resemble a deer tick and no current bullseye rash was present, matching the Gold Answer's framing.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components from the Gold Answer: exposure history with uncertainty about source, calculated attachment duration, geographic risk via map consultation, prior history with bullseye rash and treatment, visual tick assessment, absence of current rash, the patient's awareness of changing tick guidance, and the decision to send the tick for lab identification. The answer includes all key citation points [P-1, D-6, D-13, P-3] and captures the doctor's 'safer than not' reasoning for prophylaxis.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The exposure dates (Friday/Saturday) appear in [P-1], the >72-hour estimate in [D-6], Strathroy location and map consultation in [D-12-13], prior bullseye rash in [P-3], absence of deer tick resemblance in [P-5], and absence of current rash in [P-6]. The answer avoids hallucination and properly grounds conclusions in the doctor's stated reasoning from [D-6] and [D-13].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's four specified components (exposure history, attachment duration, geographic assessment, prior history) and explains how these factors led to the prophylaxis recommendation despite the two negative indicators (non-deer-tick appearance, no current rash). The answer maintains focus on the clinical decision-making process without tangential content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent response that fully matches the Gold Answer in accuracy and completeness. It correctly identifies all four risk factors that led to the prophylaxis recommendation, properly contextualizes the decision despite negative indicators, includes accurate transcript citations, and maintains perfect relevance to the question. No factual errors, omissions, or hallucinations are present."
