  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the transcript lacks explicit denials for symptoms like chest pain, sore throat, chills, and GI complaints. However, the transcript explicitly shows the mother saying 'No' or 'I don't think so' to all of these (P-13, P-14, P-19, P-22, P-23). It also missed the symptom of 'wheezing' in the list of symptoms asked about and denied.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several reported symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, including decreased appetite (P-15), potential loss of taste (P-17), and a mild runny nose (P-16). It also fails to correctly categorize the 'denied' symptoms as requested by the prompt, incorrectly stating they were not denied.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the transcript does not contain explicit verbal denials. It also includes external 'knowledge graph' style text (e.g., '[SYMPTOM] short of breath --[POSSIBLE_DIAGNOSIS]--> [DIAGNOSIS] asthma') which is not part of the source transcript or requested format.",
    "relevance": "While the answer follows the requested structure of the question, its content is largely irrelevant or misleading because it fails to answer the second half of the prompt correctly (listing the denied symptoms)."
