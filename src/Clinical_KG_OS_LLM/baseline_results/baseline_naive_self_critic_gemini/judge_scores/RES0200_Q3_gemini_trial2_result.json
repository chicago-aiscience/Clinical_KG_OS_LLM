  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains two minor factual inaccuracies when compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript's final details: 1) It states the COPD history is 'a couple years' (citing P-1), whereas the patient corrected this to 5 years in P-2. 2) It describes the baseline sputum as 'clear to yellow' (citing P-6), but the patient corrected this to 'clear to white' in the same turn. Otherwise, the core symptoms and the doctor's synthesis are correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three cardinal symptoms (cough, dyspnea, sputum changes) and the doctor's synthesis. However, it omits the specific medications (Ventolin and Spiriva) mentioned in the Gold Answer which help establish the context of 'established COPD' and current treatment levels (increased use of Ventolin).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful to the transcript but includes references to an external 'knowledge graph' and specific RDF-style triples (e.g., [SYMPTOM] cough --[ASSOCIATED_WITH]--> [DIAGNOSIS]) that were not part of the provided source transcript. It also relies on the patient's initial incorrect statements before their self-corrections.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and specifically addresses all parts of the question, including the symptoms, the history context, and the doctor's method of linking these findings."
