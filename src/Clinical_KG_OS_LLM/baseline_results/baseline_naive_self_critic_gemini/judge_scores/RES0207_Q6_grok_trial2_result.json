  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that no next steps were communicated and that the transcript ends abruptly around [P-26]/[D-22], while the Gold Answer accurately identifies the doctor's communication of next steps in [D-37] (reviewing with another doctor, coming back to discuss tests and moving forward) and [D-38]. This is a complete contradiction with factual errors about the transcript content and events.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: doctor will review info with 'the doctor who's working today' [D-37] (collaborative decision-making); will 'come back shortly' to discuss next steps including possible tests and management [D-37, D-38]; no specific tests ordered yet; patient agreement [P-37]; farewell [D-38]. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead falsely claiming no such communication occurred.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends early with [P-26] and lacks subsequent doctor turns like [D-27+], but the full transcript includes [D-27] to [D-38], with explicit next steps in [D-37]. Claims of no diagnosis, plan, or follow-up confirmation are unverifiable and contradicted by [D-37]; largely fabricated misrepresentation of transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by claiming no next steps, decision-making involvement, or follow-up actions were mentioned, staying focused without irrelevant tangents."
