  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the medication tried ('decongestants' from [P-10]) matching Gold. Assessment is correctly quoted as 'worked a little bit' from [P-10], though Gold notes additional nuance about ambiguity and reasoning (nose becoming runny), representing a minor discrepancy. Recommendation correctly cites 'Tylenol cold' from [D-39], but Gold includes more details like hydration and viral context; core facts align with no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) decongestants tried [P-10] - covered; (2) assessment ambiguous/'worked a little bit' with reasoning [P-10] - partially covered (quotes phrase but misses full reasoning/ambiguity); (3) OTC like Tylenol Cold [D-39] - covered; (4) hydration/supportive care/viral timeline [D-39] - missed. Covers core ~80-90% of key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'decongestants' and 'worked a little bit' exact from [P-10]; 'Tylenol cold' from [D-39]. Citations precise, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to the three-part question with bullet points matching each element, no off-topic content or tangents."
