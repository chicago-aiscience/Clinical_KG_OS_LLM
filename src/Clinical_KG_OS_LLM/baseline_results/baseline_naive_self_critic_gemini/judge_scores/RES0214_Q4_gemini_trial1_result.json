  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnostic test (COVID-19 swab) and the primary clinical rationale (household transmission and the need for isolation). However, it attributes some of this reasoning to a 'knowledge graph' which is not present in the source text, representing a factual error regarding the source of the information.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main points: the test, the husband's symptoms as a transmission risk, and the infectious nature of the presentation. It misses the specific detail from the Gold Answer about the flu shot being discussed only after the COVID-19 prioritization was established.",
    "faithfulness": "The response contains hallucinations regarding the source material, specifically referencing a 'knowledge graph' twice to support its claims. This 'knowledge graph' does not exist in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the user's question without unnecessary tangents."
