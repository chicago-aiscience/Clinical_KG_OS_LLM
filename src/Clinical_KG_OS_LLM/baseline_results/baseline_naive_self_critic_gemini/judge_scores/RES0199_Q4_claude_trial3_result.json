    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab as the diagnostic test, 24-48 hours as the turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. All facts align with the transcript citation [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all the key points from the Gold Answer. It addresses: (1) the primary condition to rule out (COVID-19), (2) the specific diagnostic test (swab), (3) the turnaround time (24-48 hours), and (4) the alternative diagnosis (viral illness).

These are supplementary details but relevant to the clinical scenario.",
