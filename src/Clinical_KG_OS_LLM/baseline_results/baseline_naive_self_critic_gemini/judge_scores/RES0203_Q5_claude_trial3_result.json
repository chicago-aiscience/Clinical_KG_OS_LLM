  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies the wrong exposure event. The Gold Answer clearly states that the specific exposure event was hiking with their partner two weeks ago where 'some people kind of brushed by us' [P-18, P-19]. The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies living with family as the exposure event, when in fact no household illness was reported and the patient specifically identified the hiking incident as the only possible source. This is a significant factual error that contradicts the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses the critical exposure event (hiking with partner, people brushing by) which is the central point of the question. It also omits: the timing (two weeks ago), the location details (half hour away), the patient's statement 'I don't see where else I could have gotten this from,' denial of known sick contacts, and the fact that this was the ONLY identified exposure event despite limited social contact. It covers only the symptom-to-COVID connection but fails on the main question about the specific exposure event.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a claim that is not supported by the transcript. While the patient does live with family [P-29], this is never identified as an exposure event or source of infection. The transcript explicitly shows the patient identifying the hiking incident as the potential exposure [P-18]. The Generated Answer fabricates a connection between living situation and exposure that is not present in the transcript, constituting a hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question about exposure events and connection to COVID-19 diagnosis. However, it focuses on the wrong exposure event entirely. While it does connect symptoms to COVID-19 diagnosis (which is relevant), the main focus of the question—the specific hiking exposure event—is completely missed. The answer is only partially relevant because it addresses the diagnostic connection but fails on the exposure event identification."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misidentifies the key exposure event, stating it was living with family when the transcript clearly shows the patient identified hiking with their partner (where people brushed by them) as the specific potential exposure. This represents a critical factual error that makes the answer largely incorrect. The response also fails to include essential details like timing, location, and the patient's explicit statement about this being their only identifiable exposure source. While the answer correctly connects the symptoms to COVID-19, it fabricates a connection between household living and exposure that is not supported by the transcript."
