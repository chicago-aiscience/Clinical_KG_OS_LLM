  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the main elements of the Gold Answer: planned quick physical exam, sending the tick for species identification, blood work for Lyme serology/titres, and starting prophylactic antibiotics. It also correctly conveys the intent to involve/consult another physician. Minor issue: it cites [D-18] for the physician consultation, but the explicit plan to “go talk to the doctor” is stated at [D-22] (and implied at [D-13]); this is a citation/grounding error rather than a major factual error. No incorrect antibiotic specifics were added (appropriately).",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points: physical exam, tick sent to lab, blood work for titres/serology, prophylactic antibiotics, physician consultation, and garden/outdoor preventive advice. Missing/understated elements from the Gold Answer include: (1) the explicit rationale that the tick may have been attached >72 hours and the Strathroy geographic risk as key drivers for antibiotics; and (2) the detail that ticks may be spotted by a “waving motion with their legs.” Overall coverage is high but not full.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript. The main faithfulness concern is the attribution of the physician-consult plan to [D-18], where that specific plan is not stated; it is stated at [D-22]. Otherwise, the diagnostic and treatment plans and preventive advice are supported by the cited lines.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the requested clinical plan components: diagnostics (lab/physical), treatments, physician consultation, and preventive garden/outdoor advice. No meaningful irrelevant content."
