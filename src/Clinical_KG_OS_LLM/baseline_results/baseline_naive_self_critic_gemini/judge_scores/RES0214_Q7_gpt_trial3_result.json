  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the first symptom as a stuffy nose and notes subsequent fever (present for 3 days) and ongoing sore throat, which aligns with the transcript and Gold Answer. However, it slightly blurs the intended sequence by grouping fever and sore throat together as what “followed,” whereas the Gold Answer specifies stuffy nose first, then sore throat, then fever (with sore throat present around fever onset). The husband comparison (similar symptoms for a week) is accurate but less precise than the Gold Answer’s inference that his illness started several days earlier than hers.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) stuffy nose first, (2) fever present for 3 days at presentation, (3) sore throat ongoing, (4) husband symptomatic for ~1 week. Key points missed or under-specified: (1) explicit statement that sore throat developed after stuffy nose and was present around fever onset, (2) muscle aches began 2–3 days and overlapped with fever, (3) explicit comparison that husband’s onset preceded hers by several days (not just “his week vs her 3-day fever”), and (4) mention that the clinician confirmed the stuffy-nose-to-fever progression.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript (stuffy nose preceding fever; fever for 3 days; sore throat ongoing; muscle ache present; husband symptomatic for a week). No clear hallucinated symptoms or timelines are introduced. The phrasing “just before the development of her primary symptoms” is a paraphrase but still consistent with the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested chronology and the comparison with the husband’s timeline, without irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and well-focused, but it omits key timing details (especially muscle aches and the sore-throat/fever sequence) and gives a less explicit husband-vs-patient onset comparison than the Gold Answer."
