  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Respiratory symptoms are accurately captured (increased cough, increased green/yellow sputum, small amounts of blood with hard coughing, worsened dyspnea). However, the answer incorrectly states she did not report fever or headache; the patient did report possible fever/feeling hot the prior night ([P-9–P-11]) and a mild headache ([P-14]). It also omits the reduced exercise tolerance described in [P-4], which is part of her symptomatic worsening.",
    "completeness": "Covers key respiratory symptoms and identifies cough as most bothersome. Misses several Gold Answer elements: (1) reduced exercise tolerance/functional decline ([P-4]); (2) systemic symptoms of possible fever ([P-9–P-11]) and mild headache ([P-14]). It does include sinus pressure ([P-12]) but does not include the pertinent negatives listed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most included symptoms are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate citations. But it contains a transcript-inconsistent claim that she did not report fever or headache (both are present), reducing grounding/faithfulness. Also cites [P-1] for “most bothersome symptom,” whereas this is explicitly stated in [P-12].",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing reported respiratory and systemic symptoms during the 3-day worsening and naming the most bothersome symptom, with minimal extraneous content."
