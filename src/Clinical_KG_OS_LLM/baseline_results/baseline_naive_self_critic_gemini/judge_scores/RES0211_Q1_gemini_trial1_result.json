  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies several reported symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, malaise, headache, fever). however, it fails significantly on the second part of the question. It explicitly states that nausea, joint pain, and rashes were not mentioned in the transcript, which is factually incorrect. These symptoms were specifically asked about by the doctor (D-10, D-11, D-13) and denied by Jessica (P-10, P-11, P-13).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses a large portion of the Gold Answer's content regarding denied symptoms. It fails to list the denials for rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and joint aches. It also misses 'tiredness' as a reported symptom.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a major hallucination regarding the contents of the source text, claiming that specific clinical segments (nausea, joint pain, rashes) were missing from the transcript when they were clearly present and relevant to the prompt's specific examples.",
    "relevance": "While the answer addresses the reported symptoms, it fails to provide the requested information on denied symptoms, despite those symptoms being explicitly listed as examples in the user prompt and present in the source text."
