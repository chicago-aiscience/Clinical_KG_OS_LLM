  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it explicitly states that Jessica's father's allergies, cousin's asthma, farm living situation, and homeschooling during COVID are 'not mentioned' in the source text. However, all these details are clearly present in the transcript (Father's allergies in [P-33], cousin's asthma in [P-30], farm in [P-43], and homeschooling in [P-41]).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer regarding how the living situation and family history relate to the diagnosis. It only discusses the symptoms, general allergy history, and the brother's cold, while completely failing to connect the isolated environment (farm/COVID) or family history to the current presentation.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript by claiming the absence of information that is explicitly stated. This constitutes a negative hallucination (falsely claiming information does not exist).",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it addresses the symptoms and the brother's cold, it dismisses the majority of the specific factors requested in the prompt based on a false premise that they were not in the text."
