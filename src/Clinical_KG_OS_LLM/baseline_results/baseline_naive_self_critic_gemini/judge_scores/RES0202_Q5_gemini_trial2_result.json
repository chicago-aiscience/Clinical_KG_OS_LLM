{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the transcript and Gold Answer. It accurately identifies that symptoms started after school on Wednesday, the mother's suspicion of school being the source, the lack of known sick contacts outside of school, and the absence of school notification.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the mother's mention that the school requires a COVID test to return (which relates to the 'how school attendance factored into the source' part of the prompt via exposure tracking). It also omits the exclusion of travel and environmental factors which the Gold Answer uses to further support the school-source theory.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It correctly cites the parent's statements (P-1, P-2) and the doctor's observations. It accurately reflects the mother's uncertainty regarding school contacts versus her certainty about external contacts.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the question: the role of school attendance in the suspicion, the mother's report on contacts (internal vs external), and the status of school notification."
