  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts stated in the Gold Answer regarding the COVID swab test, isolation duration of 14 days, specific isolation from the younger sister, and ER criteria (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells). Citations match [D-44], and there are no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: COVID swab test with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation specifically from younger sister, ER visit criteria. Missed from Gold: full household composition (parents and sister from [P-35]), false-negative possibility and other viral illness, no medications/supportive care/wait for results, mother's acknowledgment of viral care ([P-41]), school test requirement. Covers core management measures (approx. 80%) but omits contextual details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-44]: COVID swab and timing, 14-day isolation including from younger sister ('isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible'), ER signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weak/dizzy/fainting). Citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question's focus on diagnostic tests (COVID swab), isolation instructions/duration (14 days), and specific household member (younger sister), with ER criteria as relevant management; structured and concise with no off-topic content."
