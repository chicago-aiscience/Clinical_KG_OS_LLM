  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC products the patient tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and accurately reports the patient’s assessment that they “hasn’t really helped very much” [P-6]. No statements contradict the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Tylenol, (2) Advil, (3) Alka-Seltzer, (4) these were ineffective, (5) daily multivitamin as the only routine supplement/medication. The Generated Answer includes (1)-(4) but omits (5) (the multivitamin taken regularly [P-25]). It also omits the clarification that there are no other current medications besides the multivitamin, which is part of the Gold Answer framing.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript and properly attributed to [P-6]. No hallucinated medications or supplements are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on OTC medications used for chest pain and their effectiveness. However, the question also asks about regular routine supplements, which were not addressed (multivitamin), making it less fully responsive."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded for the chest-pain OTC trials and their ineffectiveness, but incomplete because it omits the patient’s regular multivitamin use (routine supplement/medication information)."
