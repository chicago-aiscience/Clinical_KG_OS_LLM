  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies absence of fever (P-10) and headaches (P-12), but misattributes P-15 (which is for muscle aches) to fever. It includes allergies (P-26), which is accurate but not a key review of systems (ROS) negative for current symptoms. It misses numerous Gold-listed negatives: no dyspnea/difficulty breathing (D-11/P-11), no sore throat (D-13/P-13), no chills/night sweats (D-14/P-14), no muscle aches/weakness (D-15/P-15), no chest pain (D-22/P-22), no sputum/blood (D-7/P-7), no cough triggers (D-21/P-21), and PMH negatives. Falsely claims dyspnea and sore throat absent from transcript (contradicts D-11, D-13). Clinical explanations are generic, not matching Gold's COVID-context specifics or D-16 summary. Significant errors and omissions vs. Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 9 ROS negatives (fever, dyspnea, headaches, sore throat, chills/night sweats, muscle aches/weakness, chest pain, sputum/blood, triggers), D-16 summary, PMH negatives (chronic conditions, meds, surgeries, allergies, family hx), and specific clinical implications (not acutely unwell, supports general wellness). Generated covers only fever, headaches, allergies (~3 points, partially matching 2 ROS +1 PMH). Misses 90%+ including question examples (dyspnea, sore throat). Covers <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: no fever (P-10), no headaches (P-12), no allergies (P-26) verifiable. Mis-citation P-15 (hallucinated link to fever). Falsely states dyspnea/sore throat 'not identified in transcript' (hallucinate; present in D-11/P-11, D-13/P-13). Implications plausible but add external knowledge (e.g., rules out pneumonia/sepsis) not directly from transcript's COVID focus. Multiple hallucinations/misrepresentations.",
    "relevance": "Addresses question by listing some negatives and explaining implications, but incomplete list, erroneous note denying key examples (fever, dyspnea, sore throat), and generic explanations not tied to clinical picture (e.g., COVID suspicion despite isolated symptoms). Partially relevant with off-topic errors."
