  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab [D-53] and self-isolation for patient and husband [D-53, D-54], matching Gold. However, it inaccurately frames next steps as primarily 'ruling out COVID-19' and 'investigating influenza' with a hallucinated citation [MEDICAL_HISTORY: no flu shot], while Gold specifies physical exam [D-52] and consulting the supervising doctor [D-55] as immediate next steps; minor phrasing issues like 'husband's recent exposure' also deviate slightly.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: COVID swab (100%), self-isolation for patient/husband (100%). Missed: physical exam as next step [D-52], consulting supervising doctor and returning [D-55], patient agreement [P-54]. Partial coverage of influenza mention but not as structured next step. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like COVID swab, self-isolation, influenza possibility, and no flu shot are directly verifiable in [D-53/D-54]. However, '[MEDICAL_HISTORY: no flu shot]' is a fabricated citation not in transcript; 'before concluding the encounter, they must rule out COVID-19' and 'husband's recent exposure' are interpretive/plausible but not verbatim, introducing minor hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly around the question's elements (test ordered, precautionary measures for patient/husband, next steps), with clear headings matching the query; no off-topic content despite inaccuracies."
