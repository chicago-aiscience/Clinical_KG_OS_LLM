  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports Claritin for seasonal allergies (carried 'just in case', not currently taking), birth control (taken per P-25), and past allergy shots (not every year), all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript; however, it omits the specific name 'Deyo', the 'three months' detail for birth control, shots dosing ('once a week for a little while, in winter'), no EpiPen, no medication allergies, and allergy specifics, representing minor discrepancies in detail while keeping core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: Claritin (name, indication, carrying status); birth control (existence); allergy shots (past from allergist, not every year). Key points missed: 'Deyo' name, oral contraceptive type, 'three months' for birth control; no medication allergies; allergy shots dosing/timing; no EpiPen; seasonal allergies without swelling/breathing issues. Covers approximately 50-60% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., Claritin [P-16, P-25], birth control [P-25], shots [P-16]); statement on no dosing details is accurate as specific amounts/frequencies beyond basics are not detailed; no hallucinations or unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response into current medications/carrying (with indications) and past allergist treatments, including relevant citations; no off-topic content."
