  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it claims the transcript does not provide a specific numerical frequency for Ventolin use. However, the patient explicitly states in [P-12] that they used it 'almost like 10 times this past week.' This directly contradicts the source material.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two key points from the Gold Answer: the specific frequency of Ventolin (10 times) and the specific class of the discontinued blood pressure medication (diuretic).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer 'hallucinates' the absence of information. It states that the transcript lacks a numerical frequency, which is incorrect. This is a failure of grounding in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly attempting to answer all parts of the multi-part question, although it fails to find the correct data for one part."
