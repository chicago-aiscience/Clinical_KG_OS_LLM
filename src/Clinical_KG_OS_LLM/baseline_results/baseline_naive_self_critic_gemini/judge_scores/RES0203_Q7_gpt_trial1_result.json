  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that loss of smell, loss of taste, and dry cough began around two days ago and were concurrent (consistent with P-1/P-2 and the explicit confirmation in D-6/P-6). However, it incorrectly claims there is no information on whether symptoms worsened or fluctuated: the transcript explicitly states both sensory symptoms were “pretty consistent” (D-5/P-5) and the cough was also “pretty consistent” and not worse (D-8/P-8). It also incorrectly claims there is no information on prior similar symptoms, despite the patient clearly answering “No, nothing like this” (D-3/P-3). These are significant contradictions to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers: simultaneous onset ~2 days prior.\nMisses: (1) explicit statement that taste/smell symptoms were consistent without fluctuation, (2) explicit statement that cough was consistent and not worsening, (3) partial nature of smell/taste loss (can smell very bad odors; can taste very salty foods but not normal flavors), (4) explicit denial of any prior similar episodes. Overall it captures only a minority of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "While the onset timing is grounded in the transcript, the answer includes multiple claims of “no information” where the transcript does provide information (consistency of symptoms; prior similar symptoms). These statements conflict with the source, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address onset, progression/fluctuation, and prior history—i.e., it targets the question. However, it fails to use key available transcript details for progression and prior history, limiting how well it answers the question."
