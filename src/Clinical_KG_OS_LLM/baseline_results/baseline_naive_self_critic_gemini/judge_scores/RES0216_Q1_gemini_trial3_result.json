  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is significantly incorrect in its claim that the transcript does not contain the patient's explicit responses regarding fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, and cough. These denials are clearly documented in the source transcript (P-11 through P-15). Additionally, it inaccurately summarizes the patient's shortness of breath during exercise by citing the doctor's later summary [D-36] while ignoring the patient's own earlier statements [P-7, P-9].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention upper airway symptoms like hoarseness, increased phlegm, and throat clearing. It also fails to list the majority of the explicitly denied symptoms (fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, cough, anxiety, sweating, and impending doom) because it incorrectly asserts they are missing from the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a 'negative hallucination' by claiming that specific information (the patient's denials of systemic symptoms) is missing from the provided text segments, when that information is explicitly present in turns P-11 to P-15. This makes the answer unfaithful to the provided source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the specific components of the question (reported vs. denied symptoms) but provides an incomplete and factually flawed response because it incorrectly identifies the content available in the transcript."
