  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details respiratory symptoms as dry cough starting 4 days ago, no sputum/blood, stable; GI as diarrhea 2 days ago (liquid, 5-6x/day, no blood), nausea today, vomiting yesterday (2x, food contents, no blood), GI negatives; headache 4 days ago, persistent, bilateral forehead/top, 7/10, no radiation/neck stiffness, unusual; plus smell/fatigue. Generated correctly notes dry cough 4 days, diarrhea liquid 5-6x/day, vomiting 2x yesterday, headache persistent 7/10 4 days. Errors: diarrhea onset as 4 days (Gold/P-28: 2 days), vomiting onset 'few days' (actually yesterday), misses no sputum/blood, nausea, food contents, negatives, headache location etc. Some factual errors but main points (specified in question) correct. Score: 3.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: cough dry/4d (partial), diarrhea liquid/5-6x (partial, wrong onset), vomiting 2x (partial), headache persistent/7/10/4d (partial). Missed: cough no sputum/blood/stable, resp negatives (SOB/wheeze/chest pain), diarrhea 2d/no blood, nausea, vomiting details (yesterday/food/no blood), GI negatives (bloating/gas/constipation/appetite), headache bilateral/location/no radiation/neck stiff/unusual, smell loss, fatigue. Covers ~30-40% of Gold key points. Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., dry cough [P-12], liquid stools 5-6x [P-28], vomiting 2x [P-32], persistent [P-3], 7/10 [P-8], onsets [P-1]). Minor issue: attributes diarrhea/vomiting onset broadly to [P-1] (overall symptoms) instead of specifics (P-28=2d diarrhea, P-32=yesterday vomit), but plausible and not fabricated. No hallucinations beyond 'knowledge graph' mention (not in provided transcript, but minor). Score: 4.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around respiratory (cough), GI (diarrhea/vomiting), and headache characteristics, precisely matching question's focus on GI/resp symptoms and specified details (cough nature, diarrhea freq, vomiting num, headache sev). No off-topic content. Score: 5."
