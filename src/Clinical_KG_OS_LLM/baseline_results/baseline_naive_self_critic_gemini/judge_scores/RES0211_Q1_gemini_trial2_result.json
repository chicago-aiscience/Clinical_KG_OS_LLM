  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It claims that symptoms such as nausea, joint pain, and rashes were not mentioned in the transcript. However, the transcript explicitly shows the doctor asking about these symptoms in [D-10], [D-11], and [D-13], and Jessica denying them in [P-10], [P-11], and [P-13]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these as denied symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover approximately 70% of the denied symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer. It misses skin changes/rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and joint aches. It also misses 'tiredness' in the reported symptoms section.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates an absence of information, stating that certain symptoms were not mentioned in the provided segments when they clearly were. While the reported symptoms are grounded, the final note is directly contradicted by the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question and follows the requested format, but because it misses the specific symptoms highlighted in the prompt's examples (nausea, joint pain, rashes), its utility is limited."
