  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies asthma as the respiratory condition and correctly lists the symptoms mentioned by the mother (shortness of breath and wheezing) as well as the context of physical activity.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary components of the question. However, it misses one clinical finding cited by the mother in the gold answer: the fact that the patient had already 'been worked up for that' (meaning a prior negative clinical evaluation), which is a significant part of why it was ruled out.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely grounded in the transcript, specifically referencing segment [P-28] and using direct quotes for the symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without including unnecessary information."
