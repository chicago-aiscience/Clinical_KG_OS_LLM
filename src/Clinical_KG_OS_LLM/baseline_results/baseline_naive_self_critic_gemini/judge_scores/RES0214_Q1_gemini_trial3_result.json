  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, and muscle aches). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the denied symptoms. It claims there is no evidence in the transcript for denials of headache, neck stiffness, nausea, or difficulty swallowing, yet these are explicitly denied in turns P-5 (nausea), P-7 (neck stiffness), P-8 (headaches), and P-24 (difficulty swallowing).",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the four symptoms reported by the patient but fails to list four of the five requested denied symptoms (nausea, neck stiffness, headache, and difficulty swallowing). It only covers about 50% of the total required information.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a 'negative hallucination' by asserting that information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present. Claims that there is 'no evidence' for specific denials are directly contradicted by the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant as it attempts to answer both parts of the specific clinical question, although the content of the second part is largely inaccurate."
