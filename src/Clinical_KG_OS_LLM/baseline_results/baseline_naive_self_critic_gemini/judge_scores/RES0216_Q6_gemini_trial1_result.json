  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns well with the gold answer. It accurately identifies the doctor's assessment (asthma recurrence), the physical exam plan (listening to lungs), the first treatment step (rescue inhalers during walks), and the contingency plan (revisiting the assessment if no improvement).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses two details present in the gold answer: 1) the specific mention that the patient currently does not have the rescue puffers and needs to obtain them, and 2) the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician ('the doc') before finalizing next steps.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, accurately citing sections like [D-35] and [D-36] and correctly reflecting the doctor's interpretation of the symptoms (e.g., the lack of shortness of breath moving cardiac issues lower on the differential).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is perfectly relevant, addressing all components of the prompt (assessment, physical exam, first treatment step, and contingency) in a clear, structured format."
