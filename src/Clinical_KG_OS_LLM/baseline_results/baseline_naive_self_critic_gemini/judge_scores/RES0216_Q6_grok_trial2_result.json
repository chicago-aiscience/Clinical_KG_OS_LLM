  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment that asthma recurrence is the top suspicion (phrased as 'suspects recurrence of asthma,' consistent with 'asthma reoccurring in some capacity' at top of differential in Gold [D-35]). It correctly notes cardiac ischemia is lower due to symptom profile (no pain, tightness rather than SOB on exertion [D-36]), matching Gold's implication. Physical exam (lungs), first-step rescue inhaler trial on walks, and contingency (reassess if no improvement [D-35]) are factually identical. Patient lacking rescue inhaler is implied but not contradicted. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) asthma top differential pending exam [D-35]; (2) phys exam: quick exam + lung auscultation + possible further inv [D-35]; (3) initial tx: rescue puffers (patient lacks them), trial on walks [D-35]; (4) contingency: if no help, reassess/other directions [D-35,D-36]; (5) stepwise one at a time [D-36]; (6) consult supervising doc [D-35,D-37]. Generated covers 1,2 (partial, misses explicit further inv),3,4 fully; partially covers 5 implicitly via trial; misses 6. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: assessment [D-35]; cardiac lower [D-36]; symptom distinction (tightness vs SOB) [D-36,P-1]; phys exam [D-35]; rescue trial [D-35]; contingency [D-35]. Citations accurate (e.g., [D-35],[D-36],[P-1]). No unverifiable or hallucinated details; doctor's paraphrase of SOB accurately reflected.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to answer question: overall assessment, then plan broken into exact components requested (phys exam, first-step tx, contingency). No off-topic content or tangents."
