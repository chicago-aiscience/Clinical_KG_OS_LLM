  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Symptoms: The four reported symptoms listed (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle aches) match the Gold Answer and transcript. However, the citation for muscle ache includes [P-1], which does not mention muscle aches; muscle aches are introduced at [P-13] and dated at [P-14].\nPertinent negatives: The Generated Answer is incorrect in stating the patient explicitly denied only cough and that there is no evidence she denied headache, neck stiffness, nausea, or difficulty swallowing. The transcript shows explicit denials of nausea/vomiting ([P-5]), neck stiffness ([P-7]), headaches ([P-8]), cough ([P-10]), and difficulty swallowing ([P-24], with further confirmation of safe swallowing at [P-25]-[P-26]). This is a major factual error relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Reported symptoms: Complete (all 4 symptoms included).\nDenied symptoms asked about: Incomplete—only cough is listed. Missing explicit denials of headache, neck stiffness, nausea/vomiting, and difficulty swallowing (all present in the transcript and Gold Answer). Also omits the additional pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer (e.g., abdominal pain, rashes/skin changes, bowel changes), though those are secondary to the question’s specified list.",
    "faithfulness": "The statement that there is \"no evidence\" the patient denied headache/neck stiffness/nausea/difficulty swallowing contradicts the transcript, so it is not grounded. Additionally, citing muscle ache at [P-1] is not supported by the transcript. These constitute multiple unfaithful claims/citations.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the question (four reported symptoms and denials of specified symptoms) with no major tangents. However, the denial portion is substantially wrong."
