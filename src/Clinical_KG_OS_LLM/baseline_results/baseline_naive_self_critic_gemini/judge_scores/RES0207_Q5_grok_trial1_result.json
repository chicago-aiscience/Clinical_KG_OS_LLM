{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: medication non-adherence due to forgetting (citing P-9, matching Gold's emphasis), hereditary factor with mother's epilepsy (P-26), and family history confirming predisposition to the patient's self-reported epilepsy (P-8, P-26). No contradictions or factual errors; minor omissions like naming Keppra (P-23) or birthday reason (P-24) do not alter core accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: hereditary risk (family/epilepsy runs in family, mom had it - 100%); medication risk (forgot med leading to seizure - covered via P-9); family history relation to diagnosis (genetic predisposition consistent with patient's epilepsy - covered). Missed: specific med name (Keppra P-23), exact reason for forgetting (daughter's birthday P-24), infrequent seizures/well-controlled when adherent (P-9), explicit combination of factors. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about forgetting med (P-9), family history/mom (P-26), self-identified epilepsy (P-8) are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. The 'knowledge graph' reference and its attribution of 'forgot medication' as a risk factor are not in the transcript, introducing a minor hallucinated element, but core content remains grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured with sections directly addressing medication risk, hereditary risk, and relation to diagnosis, perfectly matching the question with no off-topic content."
