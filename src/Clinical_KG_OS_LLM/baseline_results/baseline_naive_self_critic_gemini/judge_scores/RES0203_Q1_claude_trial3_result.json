  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states the patient reported 'complete loss' of taste sensation, when the patient explicitly said they could still taste 'really, really salty foods' [P-4], indicating partial rather than complete loss. The smell description is accurate (partial loss), and the dry cough is mentioned but lacks details present in the Gold Answer about it being non-productive and consistent in severity.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main symptoms (smell, taste, cough) but misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the 2-day duration specified multiple times, (2) specific examples of what the patient could perceive (very strong bad odors, very salty foods, inability to taste banana), (3) the consistency of symptoms over time rather than being intermittent, (4) that the cough was non-productive with no sputum or blood, (5) that the cough started simultaneously with sensory symptoms, (6) lack of identified triggers for the cough. The answer covers approximately 40% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes one clear hallucination by stating 'complete loss' of taste when the transcript explicitly contradicts this [P-4]. The characterization of smell loss as partial is accurate and grounded in [P-1] and [P-4]. The mention of dry cough is faithful to [P-1]. However, the lack of detail about what the patient could still perceive, which was explicitly stated in the transcript, represents an omission that reduces grounding.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying the sensory and respiratory symptoms and attempting to specify the degree of each. However, it lacks the level of detail requested in the question about 'what they could and could not still perceive,' which was a key component of the question. The answer stays on topic but is incomplete in its relevance to the full scope of the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three main symptoms (partial smell loss, taste loss, dry cough) but contains a critical factual error by characterizing taste loss as 'complete' when it was actually partial. It lacks substantial detail present in the Gold Answer, including the 2-day duration, specific examples of retained and lost perception (strong bad smells, very salty foods, banana), symptom consistency, cough characteristics (non-productive, no sputum/blood), simultaneous onset, and lack of triggers. The answer addresses the question's core but misses the detailed perceptual information specifically requested."
