  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the management plan from [D-52], including the COVID-19 swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and supportive care details like hydration, nutrition, rest/sleep, Tylenol for fevers if any, and Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches. Minor discrepancies include omitting the 24-48 hour results timeframe and the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness, but these do not alter the core facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnostic test (swab), self-isolation duration (14 days), contact tracing conditions (if positive), supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleeping well, antipyretics like Tylenol for fevers if develop, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Missed: specific results timeframe (24-48 hours), mention of alternative viral illness, explicit note on no other prescriptions. Covers approximately 85-90% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript, with accurate citations. No hallucinations; 'anseads' correctly interpreted as NSAIDs, and 'resting well (or sleeping well)' faithfully reflects 'sleeping well'. 'Viral symptom management' is plausible and grounded in context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured around the question's specified elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), with no off-topic content, directly addressing the complete management plan."
