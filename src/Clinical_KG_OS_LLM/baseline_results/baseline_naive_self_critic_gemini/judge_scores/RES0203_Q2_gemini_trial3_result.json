  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies the patient's past use of edibles as a medication or treatment tried for the current symptoms. The transcript explicitly states the patient had not tried anything to make the symptoms better [P-9] and takes no medications [P-24]. The edibles were mentioned in the context of general lifestyle/substance history [P-34], not as a treatment for the cough or loss of smell. This is a significant contextual error compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The explicit statement that the patient had tried nothing for the symptoms; 2) The specific timeframe for test results ('a day or two'); 3) The mention of potential further tests and consultation with a supervising physician. It does successfully cover the COVID-19 swab and isolation instructions.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims are grounded in the transcript (the mention of edibles and the COVID-19 test details exist), but the Generated Answer misattributes the purpose of the edibles, framing them as a treatment tried prior to the visit.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses all parts of the question, although it includes irrelevant information (edible history) in place of the correct answer for the pre-visit treatment section."
