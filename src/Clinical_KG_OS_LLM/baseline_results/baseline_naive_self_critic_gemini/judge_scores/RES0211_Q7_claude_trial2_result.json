  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding symptom order. Jessica explicitly stated in P-4 that she FIRST noticed her throat was scratchy, THEN started coughing. The Generated Answer incorrectly lists 'dry cough' as appearing simultaneously with scratchy throat in the initial symptoms section. The Gold Answer correctly identifies scratchy throat as the initial symptom followed by cough. The Generated Answer also incorrectly suggests feeling hot 'followed' the respiratory symptoms with specific temporal ordering, whereas the transcript does not establish this precise timeline - only that feeling hot was part of the same multi-day illness. The Gold Answer correctly notes the timeline is not specified.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers some key points (scratchy throat, dry cough, headache, malaise, feeling hot) but misses several important details from the Gold Answer: (1) The explicit sequential order from P-4 (scratchy throat FIRST, then cough), (2) The mild active headache confirmed at P-2 versus the pounding headache at P-1, (3) Fatigue mentioned at P-13, (4) The persistent/constant nature of feeling hot 'all the time' day and night from P-9, (5) The specific detail about shorts and tank top from P-9, (6) The doctor's summary characterizing it as 'a little bit of fever' at D-58, (7) The overall progression framework from localized upper airway to systemic symptoms. Coverage is approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains one instance of misrepresentation: it states feeling hot 'followed' the respiratory symptoms as a 'subsequent change' and 'subsequent symptom,' implying a clear temporal sequence not established in the transcript. The transcript only confirms feeling hot was part of the illness but does not specify when it began relative to throat/cough symptoms. The Gold Answer correctly notes this lack of specification. The claim about 'escalation in severity' and 'shift from initial viral symptoms to more systemic state' is interpretive speculation not grounded in the transcript. Most other claims are verifiable, but these issues represent problematic embellishments.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about symptom order and progression, and specifically addresses how feeling hot related to the timeline of cough and throat symptoms. However, it provides an incorrect answer to the core question about initial symptom order, and makes unsupported temporal claims about feeling hot. While topically relevant throughout, the inaccuracies undermine its utility in answering the question correctly."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to address symptom progression but contains a critical factual error: it lists dry cough and scratchy throat as simultaneous initial symptoms, when Jessica explicitly stated scratchy throat came FIRST, then cough (P-4). It also incorrectly implies feeling hot 'followed' respiratory symptoms with temporal specificity not supported by the transcript, which only establishes feeling hot as part of the same multi-day illness without specifying onset timing. The answer covers about 50-60% of key details from the Gold Answer, missing important specifics about the persistent nature of feeling hot, fatigue, and the progression framework. Some interpretive claims about 'escalation' and 'shift to systemic state' lack transcript support. While topically relevant, the factual errors significantly undermine correctness."
