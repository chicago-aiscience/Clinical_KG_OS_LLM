  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer. All diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick to lab, blood work), treatment (prophylactic antibiotics with rationale of >72 hours and geographic risk), physician consultation, and preventive advice (habitats and insecticide) match exactly in content and citations. Minor paraphrasing (e.g., 'discuss the case' vs 'talk to the doctor'; 'surveillance' vs 'take a look') does not introduce errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: (1) physical exam [D-18]; (2) tick to lab [D-6,D-18]; (3) blood work [D-18]; prophylactic antibiotics due to time/geography [D-6,D-13,D-18]; physician consultation [D-13,D-22]; preventive habitats (long grass, woods-fields) and insecticide [D-18]. Minor detail of 'waving motion' omitted, but core advice 100% covered; no specifics on abx details noted in either.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., D-18 for exam/blood/consult/insecticide; D-6 for tick/antibiotics). No hallucinations; paraphrases like 'to help eliminate ticks' and 'for signs of ticks' are directly grounded in context (ticks in yard, spot them).",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response into exact categories requested (diagnostic tests lab/physical, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice on garden/outdoor), with no off-topic content."
