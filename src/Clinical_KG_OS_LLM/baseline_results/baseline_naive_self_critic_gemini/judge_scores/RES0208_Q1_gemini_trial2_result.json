  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript. It correctly identifies the loss of taste, fever, cough, sore throat, headaches, muscle aches, weakness, and decreased appetite. The categorization of 'Headaches' under Musculoskeletal and 'Weakness' under Constitutional differs from the Gold Answer but is not factually incorrect in a clinical sense.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the patient's report of a diminished sense of smell (P-6). It also omits the explicit denial of a runny nose/congestion, which the Gold Answer included to provide a complete picture of the upper respiratory domain. It covers approximately 80% of the key points in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using specific quotes and correct speaker/turn references (e.g., [P-4], [P-2]). No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the prompt. However, it includes 'Difficulty Breathing (Laborious)' as a specific symptom, despite the prompt asking for symptoms 'Beyond his chief complaints of shortness of breath'. This inclusion is slightly redundant given the negative constraint in the question."
