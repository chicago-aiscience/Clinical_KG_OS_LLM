  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the bronchodilator as the medication. However, it fails on the other two parts of the question. It claims the transcript does not specify the administration method, but turn D-7/P-7 explicitly identifies it as a 'puffer'. It also claims the doctor never asked about a daily controller, whereas turn D-5 explicitly asks about a medication taken 'every day no matter what'.",
    "completeness": "The response only successfully answers one of the three components of the question (the medication name). It fails to provide the administration method and the specific description of the controller medication the doctor inquired about, erroneously stating they are missing from the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer demonstrates poor faithfulness by making false negative claims. It asserts that specific information is not in the transcript when it is clearly present in segments D-5 and D-7. This is a form of hallucination where the model ignores existing context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to address all parts of the prompt, but the content provided for the latter two parts is factually incorrect regarding the source text."
