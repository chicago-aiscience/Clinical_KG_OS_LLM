  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not include explicit questioning/denials of chest pain, palpitations, runny nose/congestion, or nausea/vomiting. In fact, these are directly asked and denied in the transcript: runny nose/congestion [D-10, P-10], nausea/vomiting [D-15, P-15], chest pain [D-16, P-16], and palpitations/fast heartbeat [D-17, P-17]. It also omits multiple other pertinent negatives present in the Gold Answer (vision/hearing changes, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling). While its general medical interpretation (e.g., absence of chest pain/palpitations lowering suspicion for cardiac causes) aligns broadly with the Gold Answer, the core factual claim about what was explicitly asked/negated contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key items required by the Gold Answer include 8 explicit symptom negatives: runny nose/congestion; vision/hearing changes; nausea/vomiting; chest pain; palpitations; abdominal pain; urinary symptoms; numbness/tingling. The Generated Answer does not list these; instead it claims they are not present and focuses on dyspnea and cough details. It therefore covers far less than 20% of the required explicit negatives and misses most differentiation points tied to those negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is not grounded in the transcript: it asserts the absence of explicit discussion of several symptoms that are clearly present in the transcript (runny nose/congestion, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations). It additionally introduces differential considerations (e.g., bowel obstruction) not supported by the transcript. These constitute multiple hallucinations/unverifiable additions relative to the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for (1) the specific symptoms explicitly asked about and negated and (2) how those negatives help differentiate the working diagnosis. The Generated Answer addresses the general concept of differentiation but fails the first, most direct part by incorrectly denying the presence of the relevant ROS negatives. It includes some tangential differential discussion (e.g., GERD/bowel obstruction) that is not central to the prompt."
