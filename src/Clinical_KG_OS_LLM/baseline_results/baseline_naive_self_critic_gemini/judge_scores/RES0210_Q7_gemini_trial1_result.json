  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors regarding the timeline when compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It places the onset of the raspy cough on Sunday, whereas the transcript (P-3) and Gold Answer specify Friday. It attributes the fever to Sunday, while the patient explicitly states Monday in P-8. It also fails to provide a specific onset day for the chest pain (Tuesday), claiming it is not explicitly dated, despite P-20 stating it was noticed 'over the last day'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The runny nose from one week prior is omitted. 2) The specific Friday onset for the raspy cough is missed. 3) The specific Monday onset for the fever is missed (misattributed to Sunday). 4) The specific Tuesday onset for the chest pain is missed.",
    "faithfulness": "While the answer is grounded in the transcript, it chooses ambiguous interpretations over explicit statements. For example, it uses P-5 to date the fever to Sunday/Monday but ignores the clear statement in P-8 ('Monday really is when I first started'). It fails to capture the Friday cough mentioned in P-3.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to address the user's request for a timeline, even though the content within that timeline is frequently inaccurate according to the source text."
