  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error regarding the doctor's reasoning in D-36. It claims that 'shortness of breath' contradicts cardiac ischemia, whereas the doctor actually states that the patient's perceived lack of breathlessness with exercise (and lack of pain) is what lowers the cardiac suspicion. Additionally, it fails to mention the patient's medication non-adherence (skipping doses and empty rescue inhaler), which was a central pillar of the doctor's reasoning in D-34.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific details of medication non-adherence (skipping the evening dose and not refilling the rescue inhaler), 2) The exclusion of new environmental triggers, and 3) The patient's own admission that the symptoms might be asthma-related despite feeling 'different'. It covers the history of asthma, general symptoms, and the therapeutic trial.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer misinterprets the transcript's logic in D-36. It attributes a reasoning to the doctor (that dyspnea rules out cardiac issues) which is the opposite of what is said in the text and is clinically inaccurate. It also presents the medication list without the vital context of non-adherence provided in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt, structuring the response around symptoms, history, and the doctor's linking logic, even if some of that logic is misinterpreted."
