  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main contributors described in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (patient forgot their anti-seizure medication and linked that to the seizure) and (2) hereditary predisposition (epilepsy runs in the family; mother affected). It also correctly ties family history to a genetic predisposition relevant to the patient’s underlying epilepsy diagnosis. Minor issues: it references a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer, and it slightly overstates family history as “confirmation” of the diagnosis rather than supportive predisposition/context.",
    "completeness": "It includes the core points (missed medication; maternal epilepsy history; patient has epilepsy), but omits several key details present in the Gold Answer: the specific medication name Keppra, the disrupted dinner-time routine due to daughter’s birthday, the patient’s statement that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent, and the explicit combination framing (hereditary vulnerability + missed dose) as preceding the episode. Overall coverage is partial rather than near-complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (P-9 for missed medication; P-26 for maternal epilepsy; P-8 for patient’s epilepsy). The main ungrounded element is the mention of a “knowledge graph” and the implied causal generalization that it ‘precipitates’ seizure (although consistent with context, it is not explicitly stated beyond the patient’s suspicion). This is a minor deviation, not extensive hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on hereditary and medication-related risk factors and explains how family history relates to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis, directly answering the question without tangential content."
