  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. It correctly specifies the swab test and 24-48 hour turnaround time, directly from [D-52]. The alternative diagnosis of 'viral illness' is a faithful paraphrase of 'another viral illness that's going around this time of year' in both Gold and transcript. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Condition: COVID-19 ✓ covered; (2) Test: swab ✓ covered; (3) Turnaround: 24-48 hours ✓ covered; (4) Alternative: another viral illness ✓ covered. Covers 100% of core key points directly addressing the question; Gold's supplementary details (isolation, contact tracing, management) are not required by the question and thus not essential for completeness here.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in transcript [D-52] with accurate partial quotes and citations. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; e.g., 'swab' and '24 to 48 hours' match exactly.",
    "relevance": "The answer uses bullet points to precisely address each part of the question (condition, test, turnaround, alternative) with no tangents, off-topic content, or extraneous information."
