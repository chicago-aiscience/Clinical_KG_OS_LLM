  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer, including the 4-5 day timeline, physical activity trigger (playing tag), wheezing and breathing difficulty as initial symptoms, fluctuating episodic pattern with resolution at rest, emergence of cough, and the single nocturnal episode. The facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: initial trigger, timing, symptom progression, fluctuating pattern, cough emergence, and nocturnal episode. However, it omits some pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer (no cyanosis, no fever, appearing fine between attacks) and the non-productive nature of the cough. It covers approximately 85-90% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer appropriately references the clinical knowledge graph in a way that appears grounded in the conversation. No hallucinated facts are present. The citations [P-1], [P-3], [P-6], [P-38], [P-43], [P-44] all accurately reflect the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all aspects of the question: initial trigger, fluctuating pattern, cough emergence, and nocturnal episode. The organization follows the question structure logically. There is minimal extraneous content, though references to 'clinical knowledge graph' add slight tangential material not strictly necessary for answering the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a highly accurate and well-organized response that correctly captures the symptom progression timeline, triggers, and key clinical features. It demonstrates strong factual accuracy and faithfulness to the source transcript with appropriate citations. The answer loses minor points for completeness by omitting some pertinent negative findings mentioned in the Gold Answer, but otherwise comprehensively addresses all aspects of the question with relevant, verifiable information."
