  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several significant factual errors. It incorrectly states the patient's symptom progression as 'persistent but intermittent' when the patient explicitly said symptoms were 'staying the same' and 'pretty steady' [P-2, P-3]. Most critically, it completely misrepresents the impact on daily routine, claiming the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine' when the Gold Answer and transcript clearly state the patient reduced from multiple walks per day to just one walk daily [P-22]. The Generated Answer also incorrectly cites [KG] as a source, which doesn't exist in the transcript. The answer does correctly identify when symptoms started (three days ago), the activity when first noticed (walking), and some exacerbating factors (walking, standing from chair, deep breathing).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It addresses: (1) the three-day timeline, (2) initial onset during walking, (3) some exacerbating activities, and (4) the constant baseline nature of symptoms. However, it completely omits or misrepresents several critical points: (1) the specific functional impact (reduction from multiple to one walk per day), (2) no missed work time, (3) the agreement between patient and doctor that symptoms are noticeable but not dramatically impairing, (4) the 'nothing in particular' triggered onset [P-3], and (5) the accurate characterization of symptom progression as 'staying the same' versus 'neither improving nor worsening'.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple issues with faithfulness. It fabricates a citation to '[KG]' (Knowledge graph data) which does not exist in the source transcript. More seriously, it directly contradicts the transcript by stating the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine' when the patient explicitly says 'the last few days I've just gone on one usually' compared to 'a couple of walks a day' normally [P-22]. The characterization of symptoms as 'persistent but intermittent' is not how the patient described them. The patient said symptoms were 'staying the same' and 'pretty steady' [P-2, P-3], which is more accurately described as stable and constant with exacerbations, not intermittent. These represent significant departures from the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer maintains reasonable relevance to the question, addressing the development timeline, onset activity, symptom progression, exacerbating factors, and impact on walking routine. However, the organization could be clearer, and the mischaracterization of key information (particularly the impact on daily routine) reduces its utility in answering the specific question about how symptoms affected the patient's walking routine. The answer stays on topic but provides incorrect information for critical components of what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates moderate relevance and partial completeness but suffers from significant correctness and faithfulness issues. While it correctly identifies the three-day onset, initial occurrence during walking, and some exacerbating factors, it contains critical factual errors, including completely misrepresenting the impact on the patient's daily walking routine (claiming routine was maintained when it was actually reduced from multiple walks to one per day). It also fabricates a citation to non-existent 'Knowledge graph data' and inaccurately characterizes symptom progression. The answer addresses the question's main topics but provides unreliable information that could mislead clinical decision-making."
