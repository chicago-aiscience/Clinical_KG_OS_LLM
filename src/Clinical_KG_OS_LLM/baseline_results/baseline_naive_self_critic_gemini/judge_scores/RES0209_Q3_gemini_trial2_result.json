{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the symptoms and the increase in bronchodilator use and accurately links these to asthma. However, it misses the differential diagnosis logic present in the Gold Answer—specifically the exclusion of infectious symptoms (no fever, no sick contacts) which is crucial to explaining why it is not a 'new respiratory condition.'",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the symptoms and medication increase. It misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the history of diagnosis since age 8, the specific environmental triggers (cold air, exercise), and the extensive negative screening for infections (fever, loss of taste/smell, etc.) used to rule out new conditions.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript and provides correct turn citations for symptoms. However, it introduces an external 'knowledge graph' framework not found in the text and misattributes the confirmation of chest tightness to turn P-16 instead of P-20.",
    "relevance": "The answer is directly focused on the question, explaining the link between the specific symptoms/medication and the asthma diagnosis without irrelevant tangents."
