  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's description of the management plan. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab, the 14-day isolation period, the condition for contact tracing (positive result), and the specific supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics, and NSAIDs).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points. It misses the specific timeframe for test results (24-48 hours) and the doctor's mention of an alternative diagnosis (another viral illness) if the test is negative, both of which are included in the Gold Answer as part of the management discussion.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, specifically referencing D-52 correctly. There are no hallucinations or external clinical information added.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the multi-part question, addressing the diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing criteria, and supportive care recommendations without irrelevant information."
