  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: 1. Onset ~2 weeks ago: implied in Generated but Gold explicitly states from [P-2]; minor. 2. Initial flu-like (sore throat 2-3d [P-13], runny [P-14]): Generated groups as 2-3d flu-like, correct broadly. 3. Productive mucus: Generated says first 2-3 days, no color; Gold 4-5 days whitish clear [P-6] → significant contradiction. 4. Other symptoms resolve 3-4d: matches [P-14]. 5. Transition to dry: Generated 'first few days' vs Gold after 4-5 → discrepancy. 6. Cough intensity/freq: Gold same/stable 3-4x/hr spontaneous [P-7-10]; Generated omits → error by absence of key fact. 7. No fevers anytime [P-12], soreness [P-15-16]: partial. Overall significant factual errors/contradictions on core timeline elements like mucus duration.",
    "completeness": "Covered: initial flu-like symptoms first 2-3 days, resolution of other flu-like symptoms 3-4 days, transition from productive to dry cough early on, persistent dry cough over 2 weeks, occasional chest soreness from coughing. Missed: explicit 2-week onset before consultation, specific sore throat (2-3 days) and runny nose, mucus production exactly 4-5 days with whitish clear appearance, precise transition after day 4-5, cough intensity 'kind of the same' throughout, frequency stable (not more frequent) at 3-4 times/hour spontaneously, no fevers at any point, COVID test negative at onset (though not strictly symptom). Covers ~30-40% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verified where cited: initial flu/resolution [P-14], dry now [P-5], soreness [P-15], no current other symptoms [P-11,12 etc.]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: productive phase 'first two or three days' contradicts [P-6] first 4-5 days (no citation to P-6); no support for exact duration link to sore throat days; cough intensity/freq details absent despite [P-7-10]; 'knowledge graph provided' and [KG] citation fabricated (no KG in input); multiple hallucinated/inaccurate timeline facts.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures symptom progression as a timeline with phases (initial, resolution, transition, current), addressing question elements like flu onset, mucus/cough changes, resolutions, and persistence; minor extras like listing absent symptoms (fever etc.) are relevant to current status but not tangential."
