  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that Jessica's father's allergies (explicitly mentioned in [P-33]), cousin's asthma ([P-30]), living on a farm ([P-43], [P-44]), and home-schooling during COVID ([P-41], [P-42]) are 'not mentioned' in the source text, directly contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate citations and explanations. It fails to recognize the family history of allergic/respiratory conditions, the timing of her allergies not yet starting ([P-16], [P-17]), and how the isolated farm household points to intra-household viral transmission from her brother's cold ([P-39], [D-58]). These are significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: father allergies [P-33], cousin asthma [P-30], allergies not started [P-16,P-17], brother cold ~2 weeks [P-39,D-58], farm [P-43,P-44], homeschool COVID [P-41], mom/dad work situation [P-42], minimal leaving house/no travel [P-45,P-46], only dog [P-48], collective implication of household transmission. Generated covers brother's cold partially and her own allergies timing vaguely, but denies/misses all family history specifics, living situation, and collective relation; covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absences of verifiable transcript elements (father allergies [P-33], cousin asthma [P-30], farm [P-43-44], homeschool [P-41]); fabricates 'Knowledge Graph' [KG] not present in transcript; correctly notes brother's cold [P-39] and symptoms but overall multiple hallucinated claims of non-existence undermine grounding.",
    "relevance": "Question specifically asks how the listed factors (father allergies, cousin asthma, brother cold, farm/homeschool) collectively relate to symptoms; Generated denies existence of most factors and pivots to her own allergies/exposure without addressing the collective context or isolation implications, making it largely off-topic."
