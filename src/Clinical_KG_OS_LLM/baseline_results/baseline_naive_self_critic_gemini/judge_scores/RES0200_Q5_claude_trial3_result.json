    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It claims 'the transcript does not contain specific details regarding the patient's current consumption level' when [P-44] clearly states 'Probably half a pack a day. It used to be one pack, even 2 packs at one point in time.' This directly contradicts the Gold Answer's accurate reporting of this information. The rest of the answer is generally consistent with the Gold Answer but missing this crucial detail represents a major correctness issue.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: (1) patient is a smoker, (2) father had lung cancer and smoked heavily, (3) patient worries about this connection, and (4) current presentation is COPD exacerbation. However, it completely misses: (1) specific current consumption (half pack/day), (2) historical consumption changes (1-2 packs previously), (3) 10-year chronic cough timeline, (4) 5-year COPD diagnosis timeline, (5) doctor's acknowledgment of cutting down, (6) offer of smoking cessation resources, (7) mother's healthy status, and (8) denial of other recreational drugs.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a critical claim that is directly contradicted by the transcript. It states 'the transcript does not contain specific details regarding the patient's current consumption level' when [P-44] explicitly provides this information. This represents a form of negative hallucination—claiming information is absent when it is actually present. The rest of the answer is grounded in the transcript, but this significant error undermines overall faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about the patient's smoking history, family history, and relation to COPD diagnosis. However, by incorrectly claiming that consumption details are absent, it fails to fully answer the 'current consumption level and how it has changed over time' portion of the question. The answer is on-topic but incomplete in addressing all aspects of the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant correctness and faithfulness issues by incorrectly claiming that specific smoking consumption details are absent from the transcript when [P-44] explicitly provides this information (half pack currently, reduced from 1-2 packs previously). While the answer correctly identifies the family history connection and COPD exacerbation, it misses approximately 50% of key points including specific consumption numbers, timelines, and the doctor's responses. The answer is relevant to the question but fails to provide complete information due to this critical oversight."
