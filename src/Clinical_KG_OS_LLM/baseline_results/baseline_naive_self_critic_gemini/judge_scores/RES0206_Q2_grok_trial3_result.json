  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that inhaler frequency is 'not documented' despite [P-26] explicitly describing a daily maintenance inhaler and a rescue inhaler used 'once every two weeks.' It also wrongly claims hypertension is not mentioned, ignoring [P-22] and [P-23] which confirm diagnosis and decision for lifestyle management over medication. It limits analysis to incorrect transcript segments ([D-4] to [P-12]), fabricating limitations not in the full provided transcript. These are significant factual errors contradicting the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: COPD - two inhalers (daily maintenance, rescue ~q2wks [P-26]), no O2 [P-1], no names, well-managed with lifestyle; HTN - diagnosed [P-22], no meds [P-23], lifestyle first (wt loss/walking [P-23-24]), BP OK, doc supports [D-25], quit smoking [P-40], rare alcohol [P-39]. Generated covers only basic COPD puffers/managed [P-1]; misses all frequencies, HTN details, reasons, lifestyle. Covers <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Cites [P-1] accurately for puffers/manageable, but hallucinates absence of frequency ([P-26] exists) and HTN ([P-22-23] exist). Falsely claims analysis limited to [D-4]-[P-12], not matching full transcript provided. Introduces unverifiable claim of 'provided transcript segments' restricting scope, leading to multiple hallucinations of missing content.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around COPD management, frequency, and HTN/antihypertensives per question, noting what's 'available' (albeit wrongly), with no major off-topic content."
