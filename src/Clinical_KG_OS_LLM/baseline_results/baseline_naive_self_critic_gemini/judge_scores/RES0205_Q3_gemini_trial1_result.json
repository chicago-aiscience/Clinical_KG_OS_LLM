  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis (COVID-19) and the negative test result. It accurately identifies the persistence of symptoms and the hospital environment as key factors. However, it slightly conflates the timeline by suggesting the doctor's current questions during the consultation prompted the investigation, whereas the transcript clarifies the patient had already taken the test two weeks prior to the visit. The symptoms described are accurate to the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main points (COVID-19, workplace, persistent cough, negative result) but misses several specific details from the Gold Answer: the specific job title (clerk), the mention of 'runny nose', the specific timing of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset), and the fact that the patient has been staying at home since the test.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The claims about the patient's work, PPE use, the negative test result, and the symptoms discussed are all verifiable. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question: the diagnosis, the evidence, and the results."
