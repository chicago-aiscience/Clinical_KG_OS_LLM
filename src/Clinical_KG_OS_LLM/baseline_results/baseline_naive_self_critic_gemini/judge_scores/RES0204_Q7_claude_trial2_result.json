  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It incorrectly states the cough was confirmed in [P-5] (which actually discusses dry vs productive cough, not duration), misidentifies when severity was discussed (claims [P-2] but the 'not getting better' statement is there while 'stayed the same' is in [P-7]), and crucially omits the patient's explicit comparison to prior experiences in [P-24] where they state they've never had a dry cough like this and previous runny noses never lasted this long. The asthma discussion is mischaracterized - the mother clarified the patient doesn't have asthma despite family history, not that they were 'worked up without results.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the explicit characterization of the cough as dry and non-productive throughout [D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6], (2) the specific statement that the cough 'stayed the same' in severity [D-7, P-7], (3) the calculation that runny nose began 2-3 days after cough, (4) the critical patient statement in [P-24] about never having a dry cough like this before and previous runny noses not lasting this long, and (5) the conclusion that this represents a novel acute event. The answer covers basic timeline but lacks depth.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains some hallucinated or misattributed content. The claim that duration was 'confirmed by the patient in [P-5]' is false - [P-5] only confirms the cough is dry. The characterization of asthma history as being 'worked up...without results' distorts the mother's statement that the patient 'doesn't have that' after evaluation. The answer also implies information about cough severity from [P-2] when the more specific answer about it staying the same is in [P-7]. Most claims are verifiable but these errors reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question's core components: timeline of symptom development, relative timing of cough vs runny nose, duration, and comparison to prior experiences. However, it provides less analytical depth than needed - the question asks about 'how symptoms developed over time' and the answer gives a more list-like structure rather than describing the progression. The comparison to prior experiences section is underdeveloped and misses the key [P-24] content. Overall relevant but could be more focused on the temporal progression asked about."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a basic chronological framework of symptom development but contains significant factual errors and omissions. It correctly identifies the 4-5 day duration of cough and 2-day duration of runny nose, establishing their sequential onset. However, it misattributes transcript citations, omits the critical [P-24] statement about this being a novel experience unlike previous illnesses, fails to adequately describe the 'stayed the same' severity pattern, and mischaracterizes the asthma history discussion. The answer addresses the question's main components but lacks the depth and accuracy of the Gold Answer, particularly in comparing this episode to prior experiences and characterizing the specific nature of the dry, non-productive cough that remained constant in severity."
