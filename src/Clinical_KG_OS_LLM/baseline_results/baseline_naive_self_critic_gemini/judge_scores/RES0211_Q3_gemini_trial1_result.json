{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer, accurately identifying the symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, and fever) and correctly explaining how the absence of sputum, GI symptoms, and joint pain supports a URI diagnosis over lower respiratory or systemic infections.",
    "completeness": "The response covers most key clinical points from the gold answer. It misses the specific epidemiological link mentioned in the gold answer—that the patient's brother had a cold, suggesting a household viral exposure—which is a relevant supporting factor in a clinical assessment.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it references a 'knowledge graph' multiple times, which was not provided in the source text, indicating the model is drawing on external context or internal training data rather than exclusively the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is exceptionally relevant, structured specifically to address each symptom and exclusion mentioned in the prompt. It provides a clear, logical explanation for why these specific findings support the URI assessment."
