  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis and the negative result. However, it states the investigation was driven 'primarily by the persistence' of the cough. According to the transcript [P-36], the test was taken when symptoms first started two weeks ago, at which point the cough was not yet 'persistent.' The Gold Answer more accurately links the investigation to the initial flu-like symptoms and occupational exposure.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses specific details found in the Gold Answer, such as the specific timing of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset) and the specific initial symptoms (sore throat, runny nose) that prompted the test. It also uses the general term 'hospital worker' instead of the specific role 'clerk' mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It accurately cites the patient's role, the use of PPE, the negative test result, and the doctor's lines of questioning.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the question: the diagnosis, the evidence/prompts, and the results."
