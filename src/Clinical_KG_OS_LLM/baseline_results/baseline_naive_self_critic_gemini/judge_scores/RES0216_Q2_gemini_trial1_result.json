  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Ramipril and Salbutamol. However, it misses Tylenol as an occasional medication. Most critically, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain information about adherence changes or dosing frequency. The transcript explicitly states the patient shifted from taking the inhaler morning and night to only in the morning [P-19] and stopped refilling the rescue inhaler because it wasn't needed for a few years [P-17].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) the specific change from twice-daily to once-daily dosing; 2) the reason for skipping the evening dose; 3) the specific reason for the lack of a rescue inhaler (not refilling it); and 4) Tylenol as an occasional medication.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer claims the documentation lacks details on historical adherence and dosing changes. This is a hallucination of absence, as [P-17] and [P-19] provide exactly this information. It fails to ground itself in these specific sections of the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address the question's components but ultimately fails to provide the requested information for the second half of the prompt, despite that information being available in the text."
