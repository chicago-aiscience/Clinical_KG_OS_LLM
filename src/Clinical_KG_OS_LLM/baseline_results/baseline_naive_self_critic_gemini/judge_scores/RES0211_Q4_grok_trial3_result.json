  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that conditions like eczema, allergic reactions requiring an EpiPen, and night sweats were not screened for, despite clear evidence in the transcript (e.g., D-9 for night sweats, D-18/D-21 for allergies/EpiPen, D-32/D-33 for eczema) and Gold Answer. It only partially covers asthma screening but misses family history, productive cough, rashes, GI symptoms, and joint pain. It introduces 'Recent Exposure to Illness' not emphasized in Gold. Significant contradictions with Gold's factual listings.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers key points: night sweats [D-9/P-9], productive cough [D-5/D-6/P-5/P-6], severe allergies [D-18/P-18/P-19/D-21/P-21], personal asthma [D-29/P-29], family asthma [P-30/P-31], family eczema [D-32/D-33/P-33], rashes [D-10/P-10], GI [D-11/D-12/P-11/P-12], joints [D-13/P-13]. Generated covers asthma partially (~1 point) and touches allergies vaguely; misses 80%+ of points (e.g., no night sweats, eczema, productive cough, etc.). Covers ~20% at best.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like 'eczema... not explicitly screened' contradict transcript (D-32/D-33). Cites some accurately (D-29, P-15/16/21) but hallucinates denials of screenings present in transcript. Introduces 'knowledge graph' not in prompt/transcript. Misinterprets responses (e.g., allergy timing as narrowing away from allergies, not as Gold's severe reaction screen). Multiple ungrounded assertions.",
    "relevance": "Addresses question by listing some screenings (asthma, exposure) and responses narrowing diagnosis, but deviates by denying key examples from question/Gold (eczema, EpiPen, night sweats), adds irrelevant 'knowledge graph' and atypical allergy focus. Partially on-topic but with significant off-topic denials and misfocus."
