  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies key symptoms as sore throat, worsening difficulty breathing, reduced taste (without smell loss), and fatigue/muscle aches, all supporting COVID suspicion per [D-43]. Generated Answer only mentions sore throat/difficulty swallowing and muscle ache, omitting critical breathing difficulty; it also incorrectly interprets [P-19] as indicating loss of smell (anosmia), contradicting Gold's emphasis on reduced taste without smell loss, and adds unmentioned 'Knowledge Graph'. These are significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: doctor's [D-43] statement, sore throat details [P-2,P-4], breathing details [P-8-10], taste details [P-19-21], muscle aches/fatigue [P-25-26], exposure [P-12], no contacts/travel/immunizations. Covered: sore throat [P-2], muscle ache [P-25], [D-43], partial taste/smell [P-19]. Missed: breathing (major), full details on symptoms' onset/worsening, fatigue distinction, exposure/no contacts/travel/immunizations. Covers ~25-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like sore throat/swallowing [P-2] and muscle ache [P-25] verifiable; doctor's quote [D-43] accurate. However, hallucinates 'loss of smell (anosmia)' from [P-19] ('maybe taste a little bit but not smell' means no smell loss); introduces unrelated 'Knowledge Graph association' not in transcript; misstates sensory as 'loss of smell with taste presence'. Multiple hallucinations and misinterpretations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom combination leading to COVID suspicion and role of taste/smell symptoms, citing transcript; minor off-topic tangent with 'Knowledge Graph', but core focus matches question despite inaccuracies."
