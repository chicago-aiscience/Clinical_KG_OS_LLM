  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main respiratory symptoms reported at presentation: wheeze, shortness of breath, slight cough, and being quite out of breath with activity (all supported by P-1 and P-3). However, it is not fully accurate about the *earliest* symptoms: in response to the clinician’s direct question about onset (D-2), the mother stated the first noticed symptoms were **wheezing AND difficulty taking deep breaths** (P-2). The Generated Answer names only wheezing as earliest, which is an important omission/partial inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are covered: wheeze (P-1), shortness of breath (P-1), slight cough (P-1), exertional out-of-breath (P-3), and difficulty taking deep breaths (P-2) is mentioned as a symptom.\nKey points missed or not fully addressed: (1) that **difficulty taking deep breaths** was also among the **earliest** symptoms (P-2); (2) episodic “hard time catching her breath” and denial of cyanosis (P-32) are not included; (3) non-productive nature of cough (no phlegm, P-31) is not included. For the specific question asked (presentation symptoms + which were earliest), the major completeness gap is the omission of difficulty taking deep breaths as an earliest symptom.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms the Generated Answer reports are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references (P-1, P-2, P-3). The only issue is interpretive (labeling only wheeze as earliest) rather than adding unsupported facts. No clear hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on respiratory symptoms at presentation and on identifying which appeared earliest, directly addressing the question. No meaningful irrelevant content."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and well-grounded, but it incompletely answers the onset portion by naming only wheeze as the earliest symptom and omitting that difficulty taking deep breaths was also first noted."
