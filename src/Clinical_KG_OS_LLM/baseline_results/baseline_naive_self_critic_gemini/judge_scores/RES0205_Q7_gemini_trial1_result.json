  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a factual discrepancy regarding the duration of mucus production; it states the productive phase lasted 2-3 days, while the Gold Answer and the transcript (P-6) specify it lasted 4-5 days. It also fails to mention that the intensity and frequency remained stable over time.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points requested in the prompt and present in the Gold Answer: it does not describe the appearance of the mucus ('whitish clear'), does not mention that intensity and frequency remained the same, and omits the specific frequency count (3-4 times per hour).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful to the transcript but inaccurately generalizes the duration of the productive cough to match the 2-3 day window of other 'flu symptoms' (P-13, P-14), overlooking the patient's specific statement in P-6 that mucus lasted 4-5 days.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and stays on topic, focusing entirely on the symptom timeline as requested, though it is not exhaustive in its detail and misses several sub-questions from the prompt."
