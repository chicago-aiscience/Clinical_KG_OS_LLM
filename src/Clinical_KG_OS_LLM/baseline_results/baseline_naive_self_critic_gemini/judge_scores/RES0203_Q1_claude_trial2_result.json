  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant errors in characterizing the degree of sensory loss. It states taste loss was 'complete' when the Gold Answer clearly documents it was partial (patient could taste 'really, really salty foods' per P-4). It also mischaracterizes smell loss as just 'diminished' without capturing the specific detail that patient could still detect very strong bad odors. The cough description is incomplete, missing the 'dry' specification and other details.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only the basic three symptoms but misses critical details present in the Gold Answer: (1) specific examples of what could/couldn't be perceived (banana, very strong bad smells, really salty foods), (2) the 2-day duration, (3) consistency of symptoms over time, (4) that cough was non-productive with no sputum/blood, (5) that cough hadn't worsened, (6) that cough started at same time as sensory symptoms, and (7) no identified triggers for cough.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a factual error not supported by the transcript - stating taste loss was 'complete' contradicts P-4 where patient explicitly states they can taste 'really, really salty foods.' The characterization of smell loss as merely 'diminished' understates what the transcript shows. However, the answer does cite specific transcript segments [P-1], showing some grounding in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by identifying the sensory and respiratory symptoms and attempting to characterize the degree of each. However, it fails to include many of the specific details requested about 'what they could and could not still perceive,' which were central to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer identifies the three main symptoms but contains a significant factual error (characterizing taste loss as 'complete' when it was partial) and omits most of the specific details requested about what the patient could/couldn't perceive, symptom duration, consistency, and other clinical characteristics that were central to the question and present in the Gold Answer."
