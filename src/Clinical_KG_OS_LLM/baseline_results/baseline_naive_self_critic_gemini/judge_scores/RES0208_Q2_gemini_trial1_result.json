  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the information it provides (Tums for reflux and the dietary change). However, it is partially incorrect by omission as it fails to list Avodart, which the patient explicitly mentions taking for his prostate in the transcript and which is included in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses approximately 50% of the key clinical information requested. While it accurately describes the reflux medication and the change to that regimen, it completely omits the second medication (Avodart) and the corresponding medical condition (enlarged prostate/BPH) mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript [P-27]. There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question. Unlike the Gold Answer, it does not include extra information like allergies or the doctor's reaction, which were not requested by the prompt."
