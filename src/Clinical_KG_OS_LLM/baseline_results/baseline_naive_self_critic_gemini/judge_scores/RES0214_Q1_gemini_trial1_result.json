  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four symptoms reported by the patient (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, and muscle aches). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the denied symptoms. It claims the patient only denied a cough, whereas the transcript shows she also explicitly denied nausea [P-5], neck stiffness [P-7], headaches [P-8], and difficulty swallowing [P-24, P-25].",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the 4 reported symptoms but fails to identify 4 out of the 5 specific 'clinically significant' denied symptoms requested in the prompt. It covers approximately 50% of the total required information.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a hallucination of absence; it claims there is 'no evidence' in the transcript for the denials of headache, neck stiffness, nausea, or difficulty swallowing, even though these are clearly present in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant in terms of its structure and focus, as it directly attempts to answer both parts of the user's specific question."
