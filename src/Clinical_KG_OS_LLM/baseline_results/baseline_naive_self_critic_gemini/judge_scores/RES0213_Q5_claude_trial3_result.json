  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several accurate facts from the transcript, including the father's heart attack in his 50s, the patient's smoking history (10 cigarettes/day reduced to 5), and the thesis-related stress. However, it contains a significant factual error: it states the father died ('age of her father's heart attack... highlights a genetic or hereditary risk factor'), but the Gold Answer and transcript [P-30] clearly state 'he's alive.' This misrepresentation of a key fact about the father's survival status is a notable error.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: (1) father's heart attack in 50s and ongoing cardiac care, (2) smoking history with difficulty quitting, (3) Masters thesis stress and living alone, (4) connection between stress and symptoms. However, it misses some details: the specific timeline ('last year'), the paternal grandfather's unknown cardiac history, history of teenage anxiety attacks potentially returning, and the pattern of symptoms being worse when alone/studying versus when preoccupied. These omissions represent about 20-25% of the Gold Answer's key details.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [P-8], [P-13], [P-15], [P-19], [P-6]. However, there are issues: (1) The claim that the father died is a fabrication contradicting [P-30], (2) References to a 'knowledge graph' appear multiple times but no such source exists in the provided materials - this represents hallucinated sourcing, (3) The phrase 'clinical documentation' suggests additional sources not provided. These represent significant faithfulness issues.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three components of the question: family history contribution, smoking history contribution, and psychosocial stressor contribution. It provides specific details illustrating these connections from the consultation. The structure mirrors the question's framework (addressing each factor separately then their interaction). Some content about 'knowledge graph' and theoretical frameworks is tangential but the core response remains focused on the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates good structural organization and addresses all components of the question with relevant transcript citations. However, it suffers from a critical factual error (implying the father died when he survived), hallucinated sources (repeated references to a non-existent 'knowledge graph'), and incomplete coverage of key details from the Gold Answer (missing timeline specifics, grandfather's history, anxiety attack history, and symptom pattern details). While the core clinical reasoning is sound and relevant, these accuracy and faithfulness issues significantly undermine the response quality."
