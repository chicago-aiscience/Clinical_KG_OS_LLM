  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most elements match the Gold Answer: COVID-consistent viral infection, COVID swab with 24–48h turnaround, 14-day isolation, possibility of false negatives, alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative, and ER warning signs (high fever, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness, dizziness, fainting). Minor inaccuracies: (1) it states the initial presentation included shortness of breath, whereas the parent largely denied SOB (only speculative) and the doctor did not affirm SOB as a presenting feature; (2) it implies asthma was “ruled out,” but the doctor instead said asthma would be added to the differential only if cough/SOB occurred without fever.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points from the Gold Answer (test + turnaround, isolation duration, false negatives, alternate viral illness if negative, ER red flags with examples, infection/COVID alignment, asthma as a conditional differential). Missing/understated items: isolation was noted in the transcript as including separation from the younger sister if possible; the Gold Answer also explicitly notes no medications and watchful waiting/return precautions—this was not clearly stated in the Generated Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all claims are grounded in the transcript and align with cited turns. However, the statement that shortness of breath was part of the presentation is not well-supported (parent said “I don’t think so”), and the ‘rule out asthma’ phrasing overstates what the doctor said. These are minor but represent small departures from the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question components: assessment/plan, ordered diagnostic test and turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negatives, and specific ER warning signs with examples. No meaningful irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and largely accurate/grounded, but misses a couple of plan details (isolation from sister, explicit watchful waiting/no meds) and slightly overstates SOB/asthma language."
