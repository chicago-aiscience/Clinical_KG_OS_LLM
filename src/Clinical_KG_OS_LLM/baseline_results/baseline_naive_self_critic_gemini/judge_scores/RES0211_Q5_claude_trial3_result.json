    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the Gold Answer significantly. It incorrectly states that 'the details regarding Jessica's father's allergies, cousin's asthma, household living on a farm, and home-schooling during COVID are not mentioned in the source text.' However, the transcript explicitly contains all these elements: father's allergies [P-33], cousin's asthma [P-30], living on a farm [P-43, P-44], and home-schooling during COVID [P-41]. The Generated Answer does correctly identify Jessica's current symptoms, allergy history, and brother's cold, but the fundamental error about missing information represents a major factual inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 30-40% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: (1) Jessica's acute symptoms, (2) her seasonal allergy history and timing, and (3) her brother's cold as a potential exposure source. However, it fails to cover: (1) father's allergies matching hers, (2) cousin's asthma establishing family respiratory history, (3) the specific timing of brother's illness (two weeks prior), (4) the isolated household environment during COVID, (5) family work-from-home arrangements, (6) lack of recent travel, (7) clarification about the dog vs. animal farm, and (8) the synthesis of these factors pointing to intra-household transmission. The claim that information is 'not mentioned' means the answer actively avoids addressing the question's core elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination in its opening statement, claiming that information about the father's allergies, cousin's asthma, farm living, and home-schooling during COVID is 'not mentioned in the source text' when all these facts are explicitly present in the transcript with clear citations. This represents fabricated content that contradicts verifiable transcript data. The subsequent points about symptoms, allergy history, and brother's cold are grounded in the transcript, but the fundamental error undermines the overall faithfulness. References to a 'Knowledge Graph' [KG] appear to be citations to a non-existent source not provided in the materials.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question but fundamentally misses the point. The question asks how multiple specific factors 'collectively relate' to Jessica's symptoms, but the answer claims these factors aren't mentioned and therefore cannot discuss their relationship. This represents a failure to address the core question. The answer does discuss some relevant aspects (symptoms, allergies, brother's cold) but without synthesizing how they relate collectively. The opening disclaimer effectively makes the answer non-responsive to the actual question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error by claiming that key information (father's allergies, cousin's asthma, farm living, home-schooling during COVID) is not mentioned in the source transcript, when all these elements are explicitly documented. This fundamental hallucination leads to failure to address the question, which specifically asks about how these factors collectively relate to Jessica's symptoms. While the answer correctly identifies some clinical details about her current presentation, allergy history, and brother's cold, it covers only about 30-40% of the Gold Answer's key points and fails to synthesize the collective relationship between household isolation, viral exposure, and symptom presentation. The major factual error and non-responsive approach to the question's core intent result in poor performance across all evaluation dimensions."
