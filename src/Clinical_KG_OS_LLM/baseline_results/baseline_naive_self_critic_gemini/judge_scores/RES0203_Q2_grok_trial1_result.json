  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the patient tried 'edibles' as a pre-visit medication/treatment [P-34], which contradicts the Gold Answer and transcript where the patient explicitly said 'No, I haven't tried anything' [P-9] in response to treatments for symptoms and confirmed no regular medications [P-24]; this is a significant factual error as edibles were recreational and unrelated to symptoms. The doctor's recommendation of a COVID-19 swab test and self-isolation instructions [D-39] are mostly correct but omit details like result timing ('a day or two'), no medication prescribed, potential other tests [D-40], and consulting the supervising doctor.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: COVID-19 test via swab and partial self-isolation instructions [D-39]. Missed: explicit confirmation of no pre-visit treatments/OTC [D-9,P-9], no regular medications [D-24,P-24], no medication prescribed, result timing, potential longer isolation if negative but symptomatic, other possible tests, and consulting supervising physician [D-40]. Covers roughly 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Edibles claim [P-34] is verifiable in transcript but hallucinated as a 'medication/treatment' for symptoms—it was a lifestyle question unrelated to the current illness or attempts to treat symptoms; direct transcript refutes any pre-visit treatments [P-9]. Doctor's test and isolation claims are accurately grounded and cited [D-39]. Overall, includes misgrounded/hallucinated interpretation.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around pre-visit patient attempts and doctor's recommendations with interventions/instructions, closely mirroring the question despite factual errors; no major off-topic content."
