  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the specific test (COVID-19 swab) and the precautionary measures (self-isolation). However, it misinterprets 'stated next steps before concluding the encounter'. The transcript explicitly mentions moving to a physical exam [D-52] and the doctor leaving to talk to the supervisor [D-55] as the immediate next steps. The generated answer instead focuses on diagnostic goals (ruling out COVID and investigating influenza), which are part of the plan but not the immediate workflow steps described in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers approximately 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It successfully identifies the COVID-19 swab and the self-isolation recommendation. It fails to mention the physical examination [D-52] and the consultation with the supervising physician [D-55], both of which are core components of the management plan and next steps provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. The mention of influenza and the COVID-19 swab matches the dialogue in [D-53] and [D-54]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured according to the categories requested in the prompt (Test, Precautions, Next Steps). It directly addresses the user's question, though it misses specific details on the workflow steps."
