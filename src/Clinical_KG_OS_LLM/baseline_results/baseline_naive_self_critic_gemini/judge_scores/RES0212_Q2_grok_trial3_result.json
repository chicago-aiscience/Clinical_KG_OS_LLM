  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the patient is not taking any prescription medications currently, aligning with [P-29] and the Gold Answer. However, it inaccurately claims the patient 'has not reported... any medications previously prescribed,' which contradicts [P-23] where she mentions previous prescriptions for eczema cream from her family doctor, as noted in the Gold Answer. It also omits current use of moisturizing creams for eczema, which are treatments. This introduces significant factual errors and contradictions regarding previous and current non-prescription treatments.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) no current meds [P-29] - covered; (2) eczema history with current moisturizing creams [P-23] - missed; (3) previous prescribed eczema cream [P-23] - missed; (4) no drug allergies [P-28] - missed; (5) possible cat allergy no meds [P-27] - missed; (6) condoms no hormonal BC [P-45] - missed; (7) marijuana/alcohol use - partially covered as recreational not treatments; (8) no OTC for cough - implied but not explicitly. Covers ~25% (current status and substances), misses majority including core eczema treatments.",
    "faithfulness": "Claim of no current meds verifiable [P-29]; recreational use verifiable [P-36-42]. However, claim of no previous medications mentioned is not verifiable and contradicted by [P-23]; citations to [D-17] and [D-19] are irrelevant to medications (they discuss symptoms) while ignoring direct [P-23]/[P-29]. Multiple ungrounded/incorrect claims about absence of prior meds.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by stating current status (no prescribed meds) and references transcript evidence, with minor tangent on recreational substances; no major off-topic content."
