  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the patient’s nasal symptoms as stuffy nose and runny nose. However, it fails to state the key documented character of the discharge (“mostly clear”) and instead vaguely describes it as “runny” and attributes “congestion and drainage” to the doctor’s statement, which was a question rather than a finding. It also incorrectly claims the patient did not explicitly say “no,” when the transcript clearly includes explicit denials (e.g., cough [P-4], sore throat/SOB/fever/chills [P-7], etc.). These are significant inaccuracies relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It includes nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, and it lists several relevant denied symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, fevers/chills, loss of taste/smell). It omits the discharge description (“mostly clear”), omits the explicitly denied post-nasal drip/back-of-throat drainage [P-6], and does not capture the time course change (stuffy first, then mostly running) or the 1-week duration emphasized in the Gold Answer. Overall, it misses multiple key points, including one central to the question (discharge character).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: (1) claiming the patient did not explicitly deny symptoms contradicts multiple explicit “No” responses; (2) presenting the doctor’s inquiry about congestion/drainage as if it “identified the nature” of the discharge; (3) mention of “knowledge graph” is not grounded in the transcript. While many items listed as denied are directionally consistent with the transcript, the above issues reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on nasal symptoms, discharge, and denied related symptoms, which aligns with the question. Some included denials (headache, nausea/vomiting) are not asked for in the prompt examples, but they are still related review-of-systems negatives and do not significantly distract."
