  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error. It claims the transcript 'does not contain any explicit instances' of the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea. However, the transcript clearly shows: [D-10] asking about runny nose (denied at P-10), [D-15] asking about nausea (denied at P-15), [D-16] asking about chest pain (denied at P-16), and [D-17] asking about palpitations (denied at P-17). This directly contradicts the Gold Answer which correctly identifies all these negated symptoms with specific exchange references. The differential diagnosis discussion is reasonable but built on a false premise.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to identify most of the key negated symptoms documented in the Gold Answer. It misses: runny nose/congestion [D-10,P-10], vision/hearing changes [D-14,P-14], nausea/vomiting [D-15,P-15], chest pain [D-16,P-16], palpitations [D-17,P-17], abdominal pain [D-18,P-18], urinary symptoms [D-19,P-19], and numbness/tingling [D-22,P-22]. It only discusses shortness of breath and cough characteristics. The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key negated findings that form the basis of the clinical reasoning.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes an unfaithful claim that contradicts the transcript. It states these symptoms were NOT asked about when they clearly were. The exchanges [D-10] through [D-22] explicitly document the systematic review of systems asking about and negating multiple symptoms. While the differential diagnosis reasoning is plausible, the foundational claim that these questions don't appear in the transcript is a significant hallucination that undermines the entire response.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address both parts of the question (identifying negated symptoms and explaining differential diagnosis implications), but fails on the first part by incorrectly claiming the symptoms weren't asked about. The differential diagnosis discussion in the second half is relevant to the question but cannot compensate for the fundamental error in the first part. About 40% of the response is relevant and accurate."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains a fundamental factual error by claiming the doctor did not ask about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, when the transcript clearly documents these questions at [D-10], [D-15], [D-16], and [D-17] with corresponding denials. This contradicts the Gold Answer which correctly identifies 8 negated symptoms with specific citations. The response fails to identify the majority of pertinent negatives essential to the clinical reasoning. While the differential diagnosis discussion shows clinical understanding, it is built on false premises. The response covers less than 20% of required content and contains significant unfaithful claims about transcript contents."
