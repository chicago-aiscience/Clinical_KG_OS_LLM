  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer omits the major symptom of difficulty breathing (clearly reported in P-7 to P-11 with details on onset, progression, and constancy), misrepresents reduced sense of taste as 'not lost their taste' despite transcript confirmation of a constant taste issue starting two days prior (P-19-P-21), includes extraneous details like mono history and remedies not central to current symptoms in Gold, and lists only one denied symptom (loss of smell) instead of the full set matching Gold (cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell, fever, chills/night sweats); these are significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key reported symptoms from Gold: sore throat (details), difficulty breathing (details), reduced taste (details), fatigue/muscle aches; Generated covers sore throat partially, fatigue/muscle aches, difficulty swallowing (subpoint), but misses breathing entirely and misstates taste; denied symptoms from Gold: 7 listed; Generated covers only loss of smell (1/7); covers approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded (e.g., sore throat [P-2], swallowing [P-2], muscle ache/fatigue [P-25]); however, 'confirmed they have not lost their taste' is a hallucinated interpretation—transcript shows 'maybe taste a little bit' followed by confirmation of onset and constancy (P-19-P-21), implying reduction; complete omission of difficulty breathing (verifiable in P-7-P-11) indicates ungrounded selectivity; citations accurate where used but incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around reported symptoms and explicitly denied ones, mirroring the question's focus on current symptoms and specific screened symptoms (cough etc.), with no off-topic content beyond a brief intro."
