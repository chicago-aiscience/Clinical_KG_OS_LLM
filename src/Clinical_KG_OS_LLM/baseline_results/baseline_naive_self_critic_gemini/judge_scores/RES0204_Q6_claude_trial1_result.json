  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the transcript evidence. The doctor clearly communicated diagnostic tests (chest X-ray at D-37, COVID swab at D-39), supervision plan (consulting with supervising physician at D-1 and D-37), and follow-up (arranging tests and returning with plan at D-40). The Generated Answer incorrectly states this information was 'not communicated' and claims the transcript ends without treatment plan discussion, which is factually wrong.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) the structured visit plan explained at D-1, (2) both diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), (3) the consultation plan with the supervising physician, (4) the follow-up steps of arranging tests and returning with the supervisor, and (5) the age-appropriate explanations provided. Instead, it only summarizes patient history, which was not asked for in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes false claims that contradict the transcript. It states the plan 'was not communicated' and that 'the transcript does not contain the doctor's reasoning for the care plan or specific instructions' when D-37, D-39, and D-40 clearly contain this information. The claim that the consultation 'concludes with the patient's history' ignores the final exchanges where the plan is discussed.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant to the question asked. The question specifically requests the doctor's complete plan including diagnostic tests, consultation, and follow-up steps. Instead, the answer provides an unnecessary clinical summary of patient presentation and history, then incorrectly claims the requested information doesn't exist in the transcript."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer completely fails to address the question and contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims that the doctor's plan was not communicated, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor outlining diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), consultation with a supervising physician, and follow-up steps. Instead of extracting this clearly stated information, the answer provides an irrelevant summary of patient history and makes false claims about what the transcript contains. This represents a fundamental misreading of both the question and the source material."
