  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details cough as 3 months initially dry/intermittent/recurrent, productive greenish gross gunk past 3 days (no blood, no foul smell), wakes nightly last month causing fatigue/poor sleep, chest discomfort only on cough, subjective fevers (hot at night past couple days, no temp), impaired exercise, origin at pole class. Denials: night sweats, wt loss, hemoptysis, N/V, stiff neck, body pain, sick contacts. Generated correctly notes 3-month intermittent cough, gross greenish gunk, pain on cough; associated sleep disturbance/fatigue/exercise limit; partial denial of pain. However, significant discrepancies: omits initial dry nature and 3-day productive onset, sputum no blood/no smell, fevers, cough origin, precise sleep details (nightly last month), most denials (only partial pain). These omissions contradict full factual consistency with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: symptoms - 3mo cough (initial dry/intermittent/Pole origin), 3-day productive greenish gross gunk (no blood/smell), nightly wake last mo/fatigue/sleep poor, chest discomfort cough only, fevers hot night no temp, exercise impair; denials - night sweats, wt loss/clothes, hemoptysis, N/V, stiff neck, body pain, 3 sick contacts (~16 points). Generated covers: 3mo intermittent cough, gross greenish gunk (no timing), pain cough, sleep disturb/fatigue, exercise; denial pain partial (~6 partial points). Covers ~30-40% (20-49%), misses fevers, sputum details, cough history precision, most denials.",
    "faithfulness": "All Generated claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: cough 3mo/intermittent [P-2], gross [P-2,P-9], hurts cough [P-3], gunk/greenish [P-2,P-9], sleep waking/sleep not great/tired [P-19], exercise [P-47], pain denial except cough/just tired [P-3,P-19]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; minor paraphrasing but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses question by structuring respiratory symptoms (cough/sputum chars), associated symptoms (sleep/fatigue/activity), explicit denials; no off-topic content, uses transcript citations, perfectly focused despite incompleteness."
