  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the three OTC remedies (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) tried for chest pain and correctly quotes the ineffectiveness ('hasn't really helped very much') from [P-6], matching the Gold Answer's facts on this without any errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) three OTC for pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) - covered; (2) all ineffective - covered; (3) daily multivitamin as regular routine/only supplement - missed; (4) no prescription medications - missed (implied but not stated); stress management and smoking are extras beyond core OTC meds/supps. Covers ~50-67% of core key points (pain relief fully, regular routine not).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (specific meds tried and ineffectiveness quote) are directly verifiable in [P-6] of the transcript with accurate citation; no hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and precisely addresses the pain-relief medications and their effectiveness portion of the question with no irrelevant content, but omits the 'regular routine' OTC meds/supplements aspect, making it mostly but not fully comprehensive."
