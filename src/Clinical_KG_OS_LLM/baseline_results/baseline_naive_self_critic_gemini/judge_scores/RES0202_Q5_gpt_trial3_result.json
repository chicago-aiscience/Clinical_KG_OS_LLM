  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly states that school attendance was viewed as the likely source (mother thought he could have gotten COVID at school) and that symptoms started after returning from school Wednesday. It also correctly notes the school had not notified them of any exposures. However, it incorrectly/over-interprets the sister as a “potential contact” in the context of sick contacts/source (the transcript only supports isolation advice, not that she was a sick contact or source), and it omits/weakens the mother’s specific statement about sick contacts outside school.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) mother suspected school as source; (2) onset after school Wednesday; (3) school did not contact family about exposures. Key points missed: (a) mother explicitly reported no known sick contacts outside of school; (b) she said it was “kinda hard to say” regarding school contacts (uncertainty rather than simply ‘none’); (c) school required a COVID test for return and for exposure notification to other families. Additional narrowing points in Gold (no travel; no home environmental exposures) were also omitted.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (school suspicion, timing, lack of school notification, COVID swab plan). The inclusion of the younger sister as a “potential contact” is based on the doctor’s isolation recommendation, but it is somewhat misleading relative to the question about suspected source/sick contacts. The claim about the mother’s “anxiety” is not explicitly stated, though concern is implied.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on school as suspected source and on reported exposures/notifications. Minor tangents include discussion of the COVID swab plan and household isolation (sister), which are not central to the question about sick contacts at school vs outside school."

  "summary": "The answer captures the main school-related suspicion and lack of school notification, but it misses several key exposure details (especially no known contacts outside school and the school’s testing/notification policy) and includes a mildly misleading tangent about the sister."
