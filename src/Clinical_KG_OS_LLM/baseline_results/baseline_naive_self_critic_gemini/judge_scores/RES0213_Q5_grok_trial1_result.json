  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details family history including father's heart attack 'last year' in 50s, ongoing heart doctors [P-30], and unknown grandpa history [P-30]; Generated covers father's 50s heart attack scaring her [P-8] but omits 'last year', doctors, and grandpa—minor omissions. Smoking details in Gold are specific (started 18, 10/day for 2 years, now ~5/day [P-13,14,18]); Generated notes trying to quit and difficulty [P-13] but lacks specifics. Stressors in Gold include thesis pressure details [P-15,16], living alone [P-26,27], nervous about running [P-28]; Generated covers thesis nervousness [P-15] and breathing [P-19] but misses others. Connections match on worry [P-8], nervousness [P-19] but Generated adds unmentioned self-medication emphasis and interprets smoking as direct trigger. Core facts align with minor discrepancies and additions.",
    "completeness": "Covered: family history basics (father's 50s HA scaring her); smoking attempt to quit/hard; stressors (thesis nervous, breathing); connections (worry it's heart thing, anxiety overlap). Missed from Gold: father's 'last year' and 'heart doctors' [P-30]; full smoking history details [P-18]; stress specifics (time crunch [P-16], lives alone [P-26,27], nervous running [P-28]); past anxiety attacks [P-22]; grandpa [P-30]. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Verifiable claims: direct quotes/cites [P-8, P-13, P-15, P-19, P-6, D-18] accurate from transcript. Hallucinations: 'knowledge graph' mentioned twice (not in transcript); 'smoking is a physical trigger for her chest pain' (inferred, not stated); 'stress contributes to chest pain, suggesting physiological overlap' via knowledge graph (external, not transcript-grounded). Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements present.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the three specified factors (family history, smoking, stressors), their contributions to heart disease concern, interactions (cycle of anxiety), and transcript details/citations—perfectly focused on question with no off-topic content."
