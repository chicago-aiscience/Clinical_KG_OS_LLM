  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the cough as starting ~4–5 days before the visit and the runny nose as starting only “the past couple of days,” indicating the cough preceded the rhinorrhea. It also accurately reflects that the cough was not improving (“doesn’t seem to be going away or getting better”). However, it misses/does not state key accurate details from the Gold Answer: that the cough was dry and nonproductive throughout and that severity “stayed the same.” It also mis-cites duration confirmation as [P-5] (P-5 confirms dryness, not duration; duration is [P-2]/[P-4]). Overall the included facts are largely correct with minor inaccuracies/omissions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) cough began ~4–5 days pre-visit; (2) runny nose began later for a couple of days; (3) runny nose clear; (4) cough not improving.\nKey points missed: (1) cough explicitly described as dry; (2) cough nonproductive/no sputum; (3) cough severity trend explicitly “stayed the same” (no worse/no better); (4) comparison to prior similar symptoms: never had a dry cough like this, and prior runny noses never lasted this long. Instead, the generated answer shifts to family history/asthma, which is not the main prior-symptom comparison asked for. Overall coverage is roughly partial (~50–70%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript (timing of cough/runny nose, clear discharge, lack of improvement, asthma family history and prior evaluation). The main faithfulness issue is an incorrect citation linking duration to [P-5], and the answer omits (rather than contradicts) several transcript-supported details (dry, nonproductive, “stayed the same,” prior-history comparison). No major hallucinated clinical events are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally oriented toward symptom timing and course, but it spends space on denials of other symptoms and asthma family history rather than directly addressing the requested comparison to the patient’s own prior similar episodes (dry cough novelty; runny nose duration). Still, most content pertains to the clinical history, with some tangential material."
