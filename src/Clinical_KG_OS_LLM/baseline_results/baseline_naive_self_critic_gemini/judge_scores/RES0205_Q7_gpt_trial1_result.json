  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures some core elements correctly (symptoms began ~2 weeks prior; initial flu-like symptoms; cough became dry; other symptoms resolved within ~3–4 days; no fever; occasional cough-related chest soreness). However, it contains a major timeline error: it states the productive/mucus phase lasted only “the first two or three days,” whereas the transcript specifies mucus for the first 4–5 days with transition to dry cough after that [P-6]. It also implies the dry transition occurred “around the time when other symptoms began to resolve,” which is not supported (other symptoms resolved by day 3–4, but mucus persisted to day 4–5). These are significant inaccuracies given the question’s focus on precise symptom progression.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points included: onset ~2 weeks prior; early flu-like symptoms; other symptoms resolved within 3–4 days; cough now dry; no fever; chest soreness with excessive coughing.\nKey points missed or inadequately covered: (1) mucus description (“whitish clear”); (2) correct mucus duration (4–5 days); (3) explicit statement sore throat resolved after 2–3 days; (4) cough intensity stayed the same over 2 weeks; (5) cough frequency stayed stable and estimate (3–4 times/hour); (6) spontaneous nature/no triggers; (7) COVID test negative at symptom onset and stayed home awaiting improvement. Overall, it covers less than half of the required timeline details.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded in the transcript: the 2–3 day duration of mucus/productive cough is contradicted by [P-6]; the timing linkage between symptom resolution and cough transition is inferred and inconsistent with the transcript; references to a “knowledge graph” and citation “[KG]” are not part of the provided transcript. Other elements (no fever, no GI symptoms, no dyspnea) are supported by patient responses, but the presence of multiple unsupported/contradictory claims reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on symptom timeline and cough evolution, which matches the question. It includes some extra negatives (nausea/vomiting/belly pain) that are only indirectly relevant but still relate to symptom resolution. The main issue is omission/inaccuracy rather than being off-topic."
