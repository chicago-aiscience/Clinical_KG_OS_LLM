    "correctness": "The Gold Answer links: (1) weight loss question to lung cancer and TB; (2) travel to domestic/exposure-related infections (e.g., Legionella/fungal) with note that travel was to Sarnia ~1 week ago; (3) sick contacts to person-to-person respiratory infections/TB exposure; (4) chemical exposure to chemical pneumonitis/occupational lung disease, with patient reporting limited direct exposure.\n\nThe Generated Answer is partially correct for weight loss (lung cancer, TB) but introduces unsupported/less targeted items (HIV, “chronic bronchitis” as weight-loss cause) and overstates “rule out” rather than “less likely but not excluded.” It is clearly incorrect for travel and chemical exposure: it claims the transcript contains no travel/chemical exposure information, when it does ([P-23], [P-33]-[P-34]). It also proposes malaria/dengue/exotic travel infections, which is not consistent with the domestic travel described and not aligned with the Gold Answer’s intent. Sick contacts discussion is broadly plausible but somewhat overinterprets that lack of contacts makes viral illness less likely.\n\nOverall, significant factual inconsistencies with the Gold Answer (especially travel and occupational exposure) reduce correctness substantially.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer: \n- Weight loss screens for lung cancer + TB; denial makes them less likely but does not exclude. (Also ties to smoking/family history.)\n- Recent travel: patient *did* travel to Sarnia; screens for exposure-related/endemic infections (Legionella/fungal), domestic travel lowers tropical concern; timing overlaps onset.\n- Sick contacts: denial reduces known exposure risk but does not exclude CAP; also screens TB exposure.\n- Chemical exposure: patient works at chemical plant but has limited direct exposure; screens chemical pneumonitis/occupational lung disease; limited exposure makes it less likely.\n- Overall synthesis: responses favor acute infectious cause over chronic/occupational.\n\nGenerated Answer: \n- Partially covers weight loss (cancer/TB; mentions smoking/family history) but misses the nuance that denial does not exclude and omits TB-specific constitutional framing.\n- Travel section misses/contradicts the key fact (Sarnia travel) and misses Legionella/fungal/exposure framing and the domestic/timing interpretation.\n- Sick contacts covered in a general way but misses explicit CAP-not-excluded nuance and TB-exposure framing.\n- Chemical exposure section misses/contradicts patient’s limited-exposure response.\n- Limited overall synthesis.\n\nCoverage is well below 80% due to major omissions/errors in 2 of the 4 prompts.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript and/or contradict it: the patient *does* report travel to Sarnia ([P-23]) and *does* discuss limited chemical exposure ([P-34]), yet the Generated Answer states these were not provided. It also adds several speculative differentials (malaria/dengue, HIV) not supported by the transcript context or the Gold Answer’s framing. While some content is plausible (viral respiratory infections, chemical pneumonitis conceptually), the presence of clear contradictions and added unsupported claims lowers faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured around the four asked screening questions (weight loss, travel, sick contacts, chemical exposure), so it is generally on-topic. However, the travel and chemical-exposure sections are undermined by asserting missing information and by focusing on exotic travel diseases that are not pertinent to the documented domestic travel. This reduces how directly it addresses the question as asked."
