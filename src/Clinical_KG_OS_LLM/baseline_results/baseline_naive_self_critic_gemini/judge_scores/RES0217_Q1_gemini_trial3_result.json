  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding joint pain. The patient explicitly denied joint pain in [P-7] and clarified in [P-1] that the soreness was in the skin, 'not the joint itself.' The Generated Answer incorrectly states she 'reported' joint pain rather than denied it. It correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) and the denial of fever and headaches.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all parts of the question, including local symptoms and the three specific systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, headaches). However, it misses the detail from the Gold Answer regarding the denial of the bullseye rash.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the patient reported joint pain is unfaithful to the transcript. While the patient mentioned soreness behind the knee, she explicitly stated it was the skin and not the joint [P-1], and later answered 'No' to the doctor's specific screening for joint pain [P-7].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both the local symptoms and the specific systemic screenings mentioned in the prompt."
