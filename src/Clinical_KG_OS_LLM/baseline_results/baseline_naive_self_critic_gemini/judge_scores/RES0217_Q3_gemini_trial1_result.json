  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the exposure history (hiking/gardening), the duration (>72 hours), the location (Strathroy), and the prior history (bullseye rash 10 years ago).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points. However, it misses a specific detail present in the Gold Answer and transcript: the patient's mention that all ticks in the area are now considered potential carriers [P-5]. This specific point helps explain why the doctor proceeded despite the tick's visual appearance, which was a specific constraint in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The use of 'known susceptibility' in the summary is a slight interpretation, as the doctor uses the history for context rather than explicit susceptibility, but it remains within the realm of clinical reasoning. Citations are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, organizing the response into the specific categories requested (exposure, duration, geography, history)."
