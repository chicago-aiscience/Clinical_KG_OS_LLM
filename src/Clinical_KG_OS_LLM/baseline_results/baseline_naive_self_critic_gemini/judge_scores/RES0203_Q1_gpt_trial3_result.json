  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies decreased smell and a mild cough, but it incorrectly states the taste loss was complete. The transcript indicates taste impairment was partial (could still taste very salty foods but not normal foods like banana). This is a major error because the question asks specifically for the degree (partial vs complete) and what the patient could still perceive. It also omits clinically relevant qualifiers for the cough (dry/non-productive, no sputum/blood, not worsening, started at same time), though those omissions are more completeness than direct inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are missing or inadequately covered:\n- Duration of symptoms (2 days).\n- Smell: partial loss with preserved detection of very strong/unpleasant odors (“really really bad”).\n- Taste: partial loss with preserved ability to taste very salty foods and inability to taste normal foods (banana example).\n- Sensory symptoms were consistent over two days (not intermittent).\n- Cough: explicitly dry/non-productive (no sputum or blood), consistent without worsening, started at same time as sensory symptoms.\n- No triggers identified.\nIt only lists the three symptom categories and gives correct degree/details for smell in a limited way; it gives an incorrect degree for taste and provides minimal detail for cough.",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is drawn from the transcript, but the statement that taste loss indicates a complete loss is not supported and contradicts the patient’s clarification that they can still taste very salty foods. No other major hallucinated facts are introduced, but this is a notable ungrounded/incorrect inference.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on sensory (smell/taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms as asked, but it does not provide the requested level of detail about what the patient could and could not perceive and misclassifies the taste deficit, reducing how well it addresses the prompt."
