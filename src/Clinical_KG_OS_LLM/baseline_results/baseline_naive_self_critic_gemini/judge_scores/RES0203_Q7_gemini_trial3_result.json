  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the onset timing and concurrency of symptoms (loss of smell, taste, and dry cough) as being two days prior. However, it makes significant factual errors by claiming the transcript lacks information on symptom progression and previous history, which are explicitly addressed in the source text.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to include two major components of the Gold Answer: 1) that symptoms were 'pretty consistent' and did not fluctuate or worsen, and 2) that the patient had no prior history of similar symptoms. It covers only the timing aspect of the multi-part question.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains 'negative hallucinations' by asserting that information is missing from the transcript when it is actually present in turns [P-3], [P-5], and [P-8]. This demonstrates a failure to accurately reflect the provided source content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, as it directly addresses each part of the user's multi-faceted question with dedicated sections, despite failing to extract the correct information for several of those sections."
