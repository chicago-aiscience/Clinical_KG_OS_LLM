  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the nature of the cough (dry, [P-12]), frequency of diarrhea (5-6 times/day, [P-28]), number of vomiting episodes (two, [P-32]), and headache severity (7/10, [P-8]). However, it incorrectly states the diarrhea onset as 4 days ago ([P-1], but transcript specifies ~2 days ago [P-28] and Gold Answer confirms 2 days), and while GI/resp onsets for cough/vomiting/headache align, it contradicts Gold on diarrhea timeline. Other details like no sputum/blood, nausea, vomit contents, headache location/persistence details, and negatives are not contradicted but omitted; core facts mostly correct with one significant onset error.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: dry cough onset/nature (partial, misses stable severity, no sputum/blood); diarrhea frequency/nature (yes), but misses precise 2-day onset, no blood; vomiting number/timing (yes), misses nausea, food contents, no blood; headache severity/persistent/onset (partial, misses bilateral forehead/top location, no radiation/stiffness, unusual nature). Completely misses all pertinent negatives (resp: no SOB/wheeze/chest pain; GI: no bloating/gas/constipation/appetite change), loss of smell, fatigue. Covers ~30-40% of Gold's key points (mainly the exact specifics asked: cough nature, diarrhea freq, vomit num, headache sev).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: dry cough [P-12], onsets referenced to [P-1] (accurate for cough/headache/vomit 'few days back', loose for diarrhea as [P-28] specifies 2 days but [P-1] supports 'few days'); liquid stools/5-6x [P-28]; vomiting 2x [P-32]; persistent [P-3]; 7/10 [P-8]. Citations accurate, no fabrications or external additions despite mentioning 'knowledge graph' (unused); minor stretch on diarrhea onset inference but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around respiratory (cough nature/onset), gastrointestinal (diarrhea freq/nature/onset, vomiting num/onset), and headache characteristics (nature/severity/onset), with no off-topic content or tangents."
