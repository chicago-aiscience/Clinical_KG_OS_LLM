  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states the sole medication is a bronchodilator (rescue inhaler) administered via a 'puffer', and the doctor asked about a daily controller ('one that you take every day no matter what') which the patient lacks (D-4, D-5, P-5, D-7, P-7). Generated Answer correctly identifies bronchodilator as sole medication but erroneously claims administration method is unspecified (contradicts D-7/P-7 'puffer') and that no question about daily controller was asked (directly contradicts D-5/P-5), introducing significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) bronchodilator as sole as-needed asthma med, (2) administered via puffer/inhaler, (3) doctor asked about daily controller med ('every day no matter what'), (4) patient does not have it, plus context on usage. Generated covers (1) partially but misses as-needed emphasis; completely misses (2), (3), (4). Covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims transcript does not specify bronchodilator administration (false: D-7/P-7 explicitly 'puffer'); claims no doctor question on daily controller (false: D-5 exactly matches); cites P-1 accurately for usage but hallucinates absences of clear transcript evidence, introducing multiple unverifiable/contradictory claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly around the question's three parts (medication used, administration, daily controller), with no off-topic content or tangents beyond minor symptom details."
