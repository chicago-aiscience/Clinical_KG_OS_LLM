  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the dry cough began Wednesday evening after the child seemed fine, that he was kept home Thursday and was very tired, and that by Friday the cough was worsening and a fever >100°F (100.1–101°F) was noted, with decreased appetite. A minor issue is that it emphasizes speculative “harder time breathing due to inactivity” in a way that could be misread as a symptom change, but it is still rooted in the mother’s speculation (P-8) and not a direct contradiction of the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) cough onset Wednesday evening; (2) fatigue noted by Thursday; (3) cough worsening by Friday; (4) fever present Friday; (5) decreased appetite noted. Key points missed: (1) explicit statement that cough persisted on Thursday and “seemed to get a little bit worse” that day; (2) that fever *emerged for the first time* on Friday (the stepwise progression summary in P-12); (3) other new Friday symptoms—mild runny nose (P-16) and suspected loss of taste/disinterest in breakfast (P-17); (4) the correction of duration from 5 days to ~3 days (P-4). Overall, it captures the broad timeline but omits several specific symptom evolutions and new symptoms highlighted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript (P-1, P-2, P-15). The breathing comment is presented as speculation and is based on P-8, though the causal wording (“due to inactivity”) slightly extrapolates. No major hallucinations, but some nuance is not tightly grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested day-by-day evolution (cough onset and change, fever onset, fatigue, appetite), with only a small tangent about possible breathing difficulty. It largely addresses the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate and relevant but misses several Gold Answer details about day-to-day cough worsening, the first-onset framing of fever, additional Friday symptoms (runny nose, suspected taste change), and the corrected three-day duration."
