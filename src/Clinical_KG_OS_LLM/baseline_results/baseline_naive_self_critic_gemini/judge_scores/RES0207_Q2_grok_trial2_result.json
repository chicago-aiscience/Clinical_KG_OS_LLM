    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer states the medication is Keppra for epilepsy (cited P-23, P-8), but Generated Answer incorrectly claims the specific name is not documented and patient only refers to 'my med' (ignores P-23 where patient explicitly says 'I'm taking Keppra'). Gold specifies circumstance as daughter's birthday celebration disrupting dinner routine (P-24), but Generated only mentions generic forgetting (P-9) without details. Generated adds unverified [KG] link to seizures. These are significant contradictions on core facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Keppra named (P-23), for epilepsy (P-8), forgot med (P-9), daughter's birthday (P-24), usual dinner timing disrupted by early celebration/no late dinner, doctor acknowledgment (D-25), isolated lapse (D-24), seizure link (P-9). Generated covers only forgot 'my med' (P-9) and epilepsy vaguely; misses medication name, birthday, details, citations, and context. Covers <20% of key points.",

    "relevance": "Generated directly attempts to answer both parts of the question (medication for chronic condition and circumstance of missed dose), with no off-topic content or tangents, though answers are incomplete/wrong; remains focused and relevant to query."
