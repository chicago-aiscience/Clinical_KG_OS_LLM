  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately reports the patient’s statement that their COVID test was negative (\"I have had the covid test and I don't have it\"), consistent with the Gold Answer. It appropriately links the investigation to being a hospital worker and having viral/flu-like symptoms with a persistent cough. Minor issue: it adds interpretive phrasing (e.g., “fearing they might spread an infection”) that is not explicitly stated, though it is a reasonable inference from the workplace concern described.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis; hospital worker/occupational exposure; initial flu-like symptoms with persistent cough; PPE use; negative test result. Key points missing: that the COVID test was performed about two weeks ago at symptom onset (P-36) and that the patient stayed home since testing while awaiting symptom resolution before returning to work (P-36). The specific detail that coworkers are “scared at work when I cough” is only indirectly referenced rather than explicitly captured. Overall coverage is partial (~2/3 of key elements).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (hospital worker, PPE, persistent cough, initial flu-like symptoms, negative COVID test). The statement about the patient’s “anxiety…fearing they might spread an infection” is not directly stated (the transcript emphasizes coworkers’ fear and the patient’s wish not to cough at work), making this a mild extrapolation rather than a directly supported fact. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the question: diagnosis investigated, what prompted it, and what testing showed. The brief mention of the clinician asking about fever/breathing is slightly tangential but still related to respiratory illness evaluation."
