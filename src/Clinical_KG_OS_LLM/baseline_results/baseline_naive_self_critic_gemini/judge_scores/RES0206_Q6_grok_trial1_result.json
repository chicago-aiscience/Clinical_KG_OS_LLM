{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript [D-43], including physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), tests (COVID swab and labs), consultations (with attending), disposition criteria (based on vitals and labs), and clinical impression (COPD exacerbation likely from infection). Minor phrasing differences like 'healthy enough to go home' vs. 'good to go home' are negligible and do not introduce errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points from Gold Answer: physical exam details, diagnostic tests (COVID swab and labs), clinical impression, disposition criteria based on vitals/labs, and attending consultation. Omits only the patient's agreement [P-43], which is not central to the doctor's plan, achieving near-100% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in [D-43] of the transcript with accurate citations; no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications—e.g., exams, tests, consultations, criteria, and impression are quoted/paraphrased precisely.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response around examinations, tests, consultations, and exact disposition criteria, with no off-topic content."
