  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that Jessica's father's allergies [P-33], cousin's asthma [P-30], household living on a farm [P-43-44], and home-schooling during COVID [P-41-42] are 'not mentioned' in the source transcript, directly contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate citations and explanations. It also introduces a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' and shifts focus to Jessica's own allergies rather than the queried family history, resulting in factual inaccuracies and contradictions with the Gold Answer throughout.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers: family history (father allergies [P-33], cousin asthma [P-30]), allergies not yet seasonal [P-16/17], brother cold as viral source [P-39, D-58], isolated farm life/homeschool/mom home/dad farm/no outings [P-41-46], only dog [P-48], pointing to household transmission. Generated Answer partially notes brother cold and own allergies but denies/misses all other key points, covering <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates absence of transcript details (e.g., father allergies, cousin asthma, farm, homeschooling explicitly present); fabricates 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' associations not in transcript; only brother's cold [P-39] is accurately grounded, but overall largely fabricated denials and irrelevancies.",
    "relevance": "Question specifically asks how listed factors (father allergies, cousin asthma, brother cold, farm/homeschool during COVID) relate to symptoms; Generated Answer denies most factors' existence and does not relate them, instead discussing unqueried personal allergy history, making it largely off-topic."
