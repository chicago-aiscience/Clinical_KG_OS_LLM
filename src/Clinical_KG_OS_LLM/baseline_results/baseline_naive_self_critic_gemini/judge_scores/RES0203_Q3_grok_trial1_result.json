  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the three key symptoms (anosmia/loss of smell, ageusia/loss of taste, dry cough) matching Gold; accurately quotes doctor's connection in D-39 and specifies swab test; minor discrepancy in not noting patient's initial COVID worry explicitly and adding non-existent 'knowledge graph'; core facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: symptoms from P-1, doctor's explicit connection [D-39], swab test [D-39]; misses patient raising COVID concern verbatim, systematic ruling out of other symptoms (fever [P-10], etc.), 'pretty well' summary [D-16], self-isolation advice, and narrow symptom profile explanation (covers ~85% of Gold's points).",
    "faithfulness": "All symptom claims verifiable in P-1/P-4-P-8; D-39 quote accurate for connection and swab; medical terms anosmia/ageusia accurate paraphrase of transcript; hallucination of 'knowledge graph' and its 'procedure covid test' not in transcript (minor unverifiable addition).",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by specifying symptom combination, doctor's connection via quote, and test method (swab); minor irrelevant tangent on knowledge graph."
