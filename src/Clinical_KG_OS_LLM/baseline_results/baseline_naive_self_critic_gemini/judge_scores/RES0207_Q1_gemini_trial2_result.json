  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer for the items it includes. It correctly identifies the shortness of breath, the seizure/epilepsy, and the fever measurement of 37.4.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is missing several key points from the gold answer. Most significantly, it fails to mention the cough (sudden, dry) as a respiratory symptom. It also omits the timing of the symptoms (3 hours prior), the unit for the temperature (Celsius), and the pertinent negatives (no chest pain, faintness, etc.) included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript with no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question asked, though it is less detailed than the gold answer."
