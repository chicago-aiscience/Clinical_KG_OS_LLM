  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the three triggers (exercise after running at gym/recess; cold air/winter; spring/pollen) and connects pollen exposure to possible allergies, consistent with the clinician’s line of questioning. It also correctly notes family history (sister with asthma). However, it introduces an external “knowledge graph” and asserts that pollen is linked to allergies rather than asthma; this is not supported by the transcript and is somewhat misleading because the patient explicitly describes pollen as worsening their asthma symptoms. These issues reduce factual accuracy relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: the three triggers; the idea that spring/pollen prompted allergy suspicion; sister with asthma. Key points missed: (1) patient reported no other triggers when asked; (2) the patient suspected allergies but was never formally diagnosed AND later denied other known allergies; (3) the exacerbation context of markedly increased rescue inhaler use (from ~once every two weeks to 5–6 times/week); (4) implication that rescue-only management is insufficient and clinician suggested medication change to improve control. Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are grounded in the transcript (symptoms, triggers, sister with asthma). But references to a “knowledge graph [KG]” are not in the transcript and therefore constitute hallucinated sourcing. The specific claim that pollen is linked to allergies rather than asthma is also not stated in the transcript. Thus the response is only moderately faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response generally addresses how triggers and family history relate to the current exacerbation and why allergies are suspected. Aside from the unnecessary “knowledge graph” tangent, it stays on-topic."
