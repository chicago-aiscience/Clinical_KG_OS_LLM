  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the stated diagnosis as 'most likely a viral infection like the common cold' from [D-39], matching the Gold Answer. It correctly includes the overlap with COVID symptoms as a reason for testing, which aligns with the transcript and Gold's context. Supportive care (hydration, Tylenol Cold), test (swab), and public health guidance (isolation, 48-hour results, public health follow-up) are factually consistent. No contradictions or errors, though it does not explicitly reiterate the 'few weeks to resolve' expectation verbatim.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnosis (viral cold), supportive care (hydration, OTC like Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (COVID swab), public health (isolation, further instructions). Partially covers expectations ('few weeks,' supportive only nature) implicitly but misses explicit mention; misses 'swab today.' Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-39]: diagnosis, hydration, Tylenol Cold, swab, isolation, 48 hours, public health. Citations accurate. Minor hallucination: references non-existent 'knowledge graph'; symptom summary (stuffy/runny nose) is accurate but not hallucinated. Mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured around the question's requirements (diagnosis, supportive care, test, public health), with no off-topic content or tangents, directly addressing the complete management plan from the end of the visit."
