  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually correct in identifying the three OTC medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and accurately reporting their ineffectiveness. However, it omits critical information about the multivitamin as part of the regular routine, which was explicitly requested in the question. The Gold Answer clearly distinguishes between medications tried for pain relief and regular supplements.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40% of the key points. It addresses the pain-relief medications and their effectiveness but completely omits: (1) the multivitamin as part of regular routine, (2) the confirmation of no prescription medications, and (3) contextual information about stress management and smoking cessation attempts. The question specifically asked for both pain-relief attempts AND regular routine medications/supplements.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is fully grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [P-6]. All claims are verifiable and no hallucinated content is present. The statements are directly supported by the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is partially relevant. It directly addresses the pain-relief portion of the question but fails to address the 'regular routine' component, which was explicitly part of the two-part question. The response is focused but incomplete in scope."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three OTC pain medications tried (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and correctly reports their ineffectiveness, with proper citations. However, it significantly lacks completeness by omitting the multivitamin as part of the patient's regular routine, which was explicitly requested in the question. While factually accurate and fully grounded in the transcript, the response only addresses approximately 40% of the required information, missing key elements about regular supplements and medication status."
