  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all the key management measures from the Gold Answer: COVID swab test with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation including from the younger sister, and ER precautions for high fever and neurological symptoms. The facts are correctly stated and consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the essential management points (diagnostic test, isolation duration, household member to isolate from, and ER precautions). However, it omits several details present in the Gold Answer: household composition context (parents and little sister), acknowledgment of false-negative possibility, mention that another viral illness could be the cause if COVID-negative, the observational/supportive approach without medications, the mother's acknowledgment about viral illness management, and school requirements for test results. These omissions represent approximately 30-40% of the contextual details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations to [D-44]. The answer does not include any hallucinated information or unsupported claims. All statements are properly grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by focusing on the specific management measures requested: diagnostic tests, isolation instructions and duration, and the household member to isolate from. The organization is clear and all content is relevant to the question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate and highly relevant information that directly addresses the question. It correctly identifies all core management measures (COVID test, 14-day isolation, separation from younger sister, ER precautions) with proper citations. However, it lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as household composition, acknowledgment of false-negative possibilities, alternative viral illness consideration, the supportive care approach, and school requirements. The answer is well-grounded in the transcript without hallucinations and maintains excellent focus on the question asked."
