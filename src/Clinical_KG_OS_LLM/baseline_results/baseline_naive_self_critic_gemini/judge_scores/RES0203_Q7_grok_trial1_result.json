  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies that all three symptoms began approximately two days prior and were concurrent based on [P-1], aligning with Gold. However, it inaccurately states there is 'no information' on worsening or fluctuation, contradicting transcript evidence of consistency for sensory symptoms [D-5, P-5] and cough [D-8, P-8], and Gold's coverage. It also wrongly claims no information on prior similar symptoms, ignoring direct denial in [D-3, P-3]. These are significant factual errors on key aspects.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: simultaneous onset of all three (cited [P-1,P-2,D-6,P-6]); sensory consistent/no fluctuation [D-5,P-5]; cough consistent/no worsening [D-8,P-8]; partial sensory loss [P-4]; no prior history [D-3,P-3]. Generated covers only onset timing (~25% coverage), misses all progression/consistency details, partial nature, and prior history.",
    "faithfulness": "Onset grounded in [P-1]. But claims 'no information' on fluctuation/worsening hallucinates absence despite direct transcript quotes on consistency [P-5,P-8]; similarly hallucinates no info on prior symptoms vs explicit [P-3]. Multiple unverifiable absences contradict transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated structures response directly around question elements (timing, severity/fluctuation, previous experience) with no off-topic content, perfectly matching query focus."
