  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. The patient explicitly stated the stuffy nose came first ('It felt pretty stuffy at first') [P-3] and that the predominant symptom changed ('but now it's mostly running') [P-3], contradicting the claim that symptoms started concurrently with no progression. Additionally, the patient clarified symptoms were 'pretty constant for the past week' [P-8] when directly asked, not intermittent as claimed. The Generated Answer only partially captures the initial 'on and off' description [P-1] but ignores the clarification provided later.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses the three required components (onset timing, symptom progression, constant vs intermittent pattern) but provides incorrect information for two of them. It correctly identifies the one-week duration but fails to accurately describe which symptom appeared first, misses the documented change in predominant symptom from stuffiness to running, and incorrectly concludes symptoms were intermittent. The Gold Answer's key points about initial congestion, transition to rhinorrhea, decongestant use affecting progression, and clarification from 'on and off' to 'pretty constant' are largely missing or contradicted.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer shows poor faithfulness to the transcript. It contradicts explicit patient statements in [P-3] about symptom progression ('It felt pretty stuffy at first, but now it's mostly running') by claiming no change occurred. It also ignores the patient's clarification in [P-8] that symptoms were 'pretty constant' when directly questioned, instead relying only on the initial 'on and off' description from [P-1]. The claim of concurrent onset is not supported by the transcript and contradicts [P-3]. The answer fails to properly integrate multiple relevant exchanges from the conversation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: chronological progression, which symptom appeared first, and whether symptoms were constant or intermittent. However, while structurally relevant, the factually incorrect content undermines its utility in answering the question accurately. The response stays focused on the nasal symptoms without introducing irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's structure but contains multiple significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims symptoms started concurrently (contradicting P-3's 'stuffy at first'), incorrectly states no predominant symptom changed (contradicting P-3's 'now it's mostly running'), and incorrectly concludes symptoms were intermittent (contradicting P-8's 'pretty constant'). The answer demonstrates poor faithfulness to the transcript by ignoring explicit patient clarifications and failing to integrate key exchanges. While relevant to the question, the substantial inaccuracies make it an unreliable response."
