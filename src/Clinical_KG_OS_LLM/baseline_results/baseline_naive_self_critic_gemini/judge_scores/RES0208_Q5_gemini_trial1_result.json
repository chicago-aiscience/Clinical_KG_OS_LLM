  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the connection between the grandson's cold and the doctor's assessment of infection. However, it is factually incorrect regarding the second part of the question. It claims the doctor did not explore travel or client visits, whereas the transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about travel outside the province [D-24] and in-person client visits [D-31, D-32].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses approximately 50% of the required information from the Gold Answer. While it covers the grandson's role, it fails to report the excluded pathways (travel and work) by incorrectly stating they were not discussed in the consultation.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on faithfulness. It explicitly states there is 'no evidence in the text' for inquiries about travel or clients, which directly contradicts the transcript [D-24, D-32]. Additionally, it refers to a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source transcript, representing an external hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure as it addresses both parts of the multi-part question, although the content provided for the second part is factually wrong."
