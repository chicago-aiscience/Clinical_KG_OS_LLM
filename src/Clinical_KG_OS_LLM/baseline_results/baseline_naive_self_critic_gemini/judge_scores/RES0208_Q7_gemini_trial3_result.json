  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript regarding the symptoms it does include. However, it misses three symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: generalized body aches (P-20), diminished sense of smell (P-6), and mild headaches (P-11). It correctly attributes the timeline for shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, loss of taste, cough, and sore throat.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the majority of the timeline phases but misses several specific symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: body aches (present from onset), diminished smell (appeared this morning), and headaches (emerging/baseline). It captures about 70% of the relevant clinical information from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is well-grounded in the transcript. There is a minor error in the 'Sore Throat' section where it quotes the doctor's question about smell (D-6) while discussing the sore throat, which is a slight misalignment, but the patient's report of a 'starting' sore throat (P-9) is correctly identified.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request to reconstruct the timeline across the three requested categories (onset, recent, and emerging). It stays focused on the symptom progression without irrelevant tangents."
