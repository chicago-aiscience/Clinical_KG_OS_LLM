  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error: it claims the patient 'did not explicitly state the word no' to inquiries, whereas the transcript shows the patient said 'No' or 'Nope' in [P-4], [P-6], [P-7], [P-14], [P-16], [P-17], [P-18], and [P-19]. It also fails to mention that the discharge was 'mostly clear'.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the character of the discharge ('mostly clear') and fails to list 'post-nasal drip' in the denied symptoms section, which was specifically requested in the prompt and present in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a meta-point about the dialogue (that the patient didn't say 'no') which directly contradicts the source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure and directly addresses the categories asked in the question, despite the factual errors."
