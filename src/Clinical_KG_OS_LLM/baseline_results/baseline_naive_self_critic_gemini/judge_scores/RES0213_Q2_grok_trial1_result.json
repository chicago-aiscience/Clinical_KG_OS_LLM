  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists Tylenol, Advil, and Alka-Seltzer as the OTC medications tried for chest pain and correctly quotes the patient's statement on their ineffectiveness ('hasn't really helped very much'), which is fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [P-6]; no factual errors or contradictions in the content provided.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer for pain [P-6]; 2) ineffective [P-6]; 3) daily multivitamin as regular routine [P-25]; 4) no prescription medications [D-25, P-25]; 5) stress management via reading and running [P-28]; 6) trying to quit smoking, reduced from ~10 to 5 cigarettes/day [P-13, P-14, P-18]. Generated covers only points 1 and 2 (~33% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer tried for pain; 'hasn't really helped very much') are directly verifiable in transcript [P-6]; minor variation in quote phrasing ('hasn't' vs 'haven't') but accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the OTC medications for chest pain and their effectiveness, which is central to the question, but omits coverage of regular routine supplements/medications (e.g., multivitamin), making it only partially comprehensive for the full question scope."
