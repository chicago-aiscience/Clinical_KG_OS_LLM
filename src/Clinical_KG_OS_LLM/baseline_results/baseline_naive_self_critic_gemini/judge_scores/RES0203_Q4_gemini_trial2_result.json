  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error: it claims that 'dyspnea' (difficulty breathing) and 'sore throat' were not in the transcript. However, they appear in [D-11, P-11] and [D-13, P-13] respectively. It correctly identifies the absence of fever, headaches, and allergies, but its clinical interpretation for headaches is generic and not specific to the COVID-19 screening context of the encounter.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is highly incomplete. It only lists three negative findings (fever, headaches, allergies), whereas the Gold Answer lists at least 14 items, including difficulty breathing, sore throat, chills, night sweats, muscle aches, chest pain, sputum, triggers, chronic conditions, and more. It fails to cover roughly 80% of the relevant negative findings mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer fails on faithfulness by hallucinating that certain parts of the transcript are missing. It explicitly states that dyspnea and sore throat 'were not identified in the provided transcript segments,' which is objectively false based on lines [D-11] and [D-13].",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question but fails to follow the specific instruction to include 'dyspnea and sore throat,' which were provided as examples in the prompt itself. By missing these and many other symptoms, it provides an insufficient response to the user's query."
