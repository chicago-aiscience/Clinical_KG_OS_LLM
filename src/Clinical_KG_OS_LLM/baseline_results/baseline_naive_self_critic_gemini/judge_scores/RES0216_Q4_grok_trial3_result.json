  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as 'cardiac ischemia' (equivalent to Gold's 'cardiac ischemic picture' from [D-36]). It accurately notes the doctor's citation of lack of shortness of breath with exercise [D-36] and absence of chest pain [D-36], corroborated by patient statements [P-1, P-5]. However, it omits the doctor's specific screening and negation of anxiety, sweating, or impending doom [D-6, P-6], which Gold Answer highlights as key absent symptoms. Core facts align, but minor omissions create slight discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: condition ('cardiac ischemic picture' [D-36]); nature of complaints (tightness not pain [P-5], not classic exertional dyspnea/SOB [D-36, P-7]); absences (no pain [P-5], no anxiety/sweaty/impending doom [D-6, P-6]). Generated covers: condition; nature (no SOB [D-36], tightness implied via no pain); absence (no pain [D-36, P-1]). Misses explicit anxiety/sweat/doom absences and clinician screening details. Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: condition [D-36]; no SOB with exercise directly from [D-36]; no pain from [D-36] and patient [P-1]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details. Citations accurate and grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by specifying the condition and doctor-cited symptom findings (nature: SOB/pain characteristics; absences: pain), with clear structure and no off-topic content."
