  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three main factors: the husband's illness, the lack of a flu shot, and the limited outside contact (hiking/working from home). However, it contains a factual error in the third section, stating there was a 'simultaneous onset of symptoms.' The transcript and Gold Answer specify that the husband had been ill for a week [P-19] while the patient had been ill for three days [P-1], which is a key distinction for establishing household transmission sequence.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It addresses the husband's prior illness, the lack of influenza vaccination, and the patient's limited exposure to the community (hiking and working from home).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, providing specific citations. The 'Knowledge Graph' sections are an external organizational framework but accurately reflect the logic present in the text. The only unfaithful claim is the 'simultaneous' nature of the symptom onset, which contradicts P-1 and P-19.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing each component of the prompt (husband's illness, household/contact, and flu shot) and explaining how they collectively shape the doctor's differential diagnosis."
