  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly explains that hiking Friday and gardening Saturday created a plausible exposure window leading the doctor to estimate the tick could have been attached for “longer than at least 72 hours” (consistent with [D-6]) and that this supported prophylactic antibiotics. It also correctly states the doctor used the Ontario Lyme distribution map to note Strathroy was “close enough to be considered…concerning” and therefore proceeded with antibiotics (consistent with [D-13]).\n\nHowever, it adds an unsupported claim about a “knowledge graph indicating Strathroy is a [RISK_FACTOR],” which is not in the transcript and slightly undermines factual accuracy/grounding.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) exposure activities Friday hiking and Saturday gardening; (2) uncertainty of acquisition used to infer longer attachment; (3) doctor’s explicit ≥72-hour estimate; (4) prophylactic antibiotics recommendation; (5) Strathroy location; (6) use of Ontario Lyme map; (7) Strathroy deemed concerning; (8) moving forward with antibiotics.\n\nMinor elements not explicitly included: that the tick was discovered/removed “earlier today” ([D-1]) and the doctor’s intermediate step noting “a little bit of time since you were last outdoors” ([D-2]).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (activities on Fri/Sat, ≥72 hours estimate, map-based concern about Strathroy, decision to proceed with antibiotics). The only clear ungrounded element is the reference to a “knowledge graph” and labeling Strathroy as a “[RISK_FACTOR],” which is not mentioned in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (duration reasoning from Fri/Sat activities and geographic-risk justification via the Ontario map) with minimal extraneous content."
