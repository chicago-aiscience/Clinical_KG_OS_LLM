  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the doctor's cited symptoms for general infection (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches) matching Gold [D-36]. For COVID concern, it correctly lists difficulty breathing, cough, and sore throat from [D-36]. However, it introduces minor discrepancies by attributing patient's feeling hot and loss of taste as corroborating evidence for COVID linked via a 'knowledge graph,' which Gold explicitly notes were not cited by the doctor in the assessment, making core facts correct but with additions not aligned with Gold's precision.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: general infection symptoms (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches); COVID symptoms (difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough); note that loss of taste/smell not explicitly cited; focus on respiratory findings. Generated covers all cited symptoms (100% for those), but misses the nuance that taste/smell were not named in D-36 and adds extraneous patient symptoms and KG, covering ~90% effectively.",
    "faithfulness": "Main claims about doctor's cited symptoms in [D-36] are verifiable (fevers/fatigue/muscle aches; difficulty breathing/sore throat/cough). Patient reports (tired [P-1/P-2], achy [P-20], hot [P-4], loss of taste [P-4]) are in transcript but not cited by doctor for COVID. However, 'knowledge graph' is entirely hallucinated/not in transcript; linking loss of taste/hot specifically to doctor's COVID reasoning via KG is multiple unverifiable/hallucinated additions.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around the two parts of the question (general infection symptoms and COVID-specific symptoms), with clear headings and citations, though minor tangents on patient reports and KG slightly dilute focus."
