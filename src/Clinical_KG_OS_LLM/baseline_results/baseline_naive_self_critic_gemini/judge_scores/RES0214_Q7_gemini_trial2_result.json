  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the stuffy nose as the first symptom, followed by fever and sore throat, and accurately notes the husband's one-week symptom duration compared to the patient's three-day fever.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but is less detailed than the gold answer. It misses the specific timing of the muscle aches (which the gold answer correctly notes were concurrent with the fever for 2-3 days) and instead describes when they were mentioned in the interview. It also omits the synthesis of the 4-day gap between the husband and patient and the doctor's note on household transmission.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is faithful to the transcript. All claims regarding the stuffy nose, fever duration, and husband's timeline are supported by the text. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, providing a timeline for the patient and a comparison with her husband."
