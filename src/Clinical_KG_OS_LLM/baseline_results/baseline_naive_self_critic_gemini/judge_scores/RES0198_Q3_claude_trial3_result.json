  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly references a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not exist in the source material and attributes symptom associations to this non-existent source. The core diagnosis is correct (viral infection/common cold), but the reasoning pathway differs substantially from the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer systematically addresses specific evidence categories (symptom type, discharge quality, duration, progression) and explicitly explains what evidence argues AGAINST allergic and bacterial causes, while the Generated Answer only broadly addresses exclusion criteria.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions: (1) the doctor's conclusion of viral infection, (2) absence of certain symptoms, and (3) symptom characteristics. However, it completely omits critical elements including: (1) specific discharge quality ('mostly clear' as evidence against bacterial), (2) duration and temporal progression details (one week, initial stuffiness to runny nose), (3) explicit evidence AGAINST allergic etiology (no exposure to allergens, no known allergies, no prior episodes), (4) explicit evidence AGAINST bacterial etiology (no fever, no colored discharge), and (5) the daycare exposure context. The answer also introduces non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' references.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination by referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not exist in the transcript. While most other claims can be traced to the transcript (doctor's diagnosis in D-39, symptom inquiries in D-7, D-14, D-16, pandemic context in D-39), the fabricated 'Knowledge Graph' reference significantly undermines the faithfulness of the response. The symptom associations are real from the transcript but are misattributed to this non-existent source.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is mostly relevant to the question, attempting to explain the evidence for viral infection. However, it only partially addresses the full scope of the question which asks for evidence supporting viral infection 'rather than allergic or bacterial cause.' The answer focuses primarily on general viral evidence and briefly mentions exclusion of 'severe' features, but fails to systematically address the specific evidence distinguishing viral from allergic and bacterial etiologies as detailed in the Gold Answer."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. The most critical flaw is the fabrication of a 'Knowledge Graph' reference that does not exist in the source material, severely compromising faithfulness. While it correctly identifies the viral diagnosis and mentions some supporting symptoms, it covers less than half of the key evidence points from the Gold Answer. It fails to systematically address evidence distinguishing viral from allergic and bacterial causes—a central requirement of the question. The answer omits crucial details about discharge quality, temporal progression, specific allergen/bacterial exclusion criteria, and exposure history context. Overall, the response provides a superficial treatment of the question with major factual and attribution errors."
