  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: medication non-adherence (forgot med, cited P-9), hereditary factor (epilepsy runs in family, mom had it, P-26), and family history relating to predisposition and patient's epilepsy (P-8, P-26). No factual errors or contradictions; all claims align with Gold, though it omits details like Keppra name, birthday reason, and infrequent seizures.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: hereditary risk (family epilepsy, mom - 100%), medication non-adherence (forgot med - yes), relation to diagnosis (genetic predisposition, confirms epilepsy - yes). Missed specifics: Keppra name [P-23], birthday disruption [P-24], infrequent seizures when compliant [P-9]. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims verifiable: forgot med [P-9], family history/mom [P-26], patient epilepsy [P-8]. 'Knowledge graph' reference not in transcript (minor hallucination/external assumption), but does not fabricate transcript facts; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around medication risk, hereditary risk, and family history relation to diagnosis, perfectly matching question focus with no off-topic content."
