  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the information regarding infectious screening and diagnostic testing is not present in the transcript. However, the transcript explicitly includes screening for colds/infections (D-21), sick contacts (D-22, D-23), travel (D-24), loss of taste/smell (D-25), fevers (D-26), nausea/vomiting (D-27), and belly pain (D-28). It also explicitly mentions the plan for a COVID swab (D-29).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points required by the Gold Answer. It fails to list any of the infectious symptoms, the exposure history questions, the patient's negative responses, or the planned COVID swab.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript by claiming the information is absent. This is a hallucination of omission, as the text clearly contains the specific dialogue lines needed to answer the question.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question asked. Instead of answering the specific query about infectious screening, it provides a summary of asthma triggers and then concludes the relevant information is missing."
