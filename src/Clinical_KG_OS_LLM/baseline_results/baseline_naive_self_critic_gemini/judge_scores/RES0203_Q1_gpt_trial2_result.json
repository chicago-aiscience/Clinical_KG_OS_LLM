  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three symptom categories present in the transcript (decreased smell, decreased taste, cough). However, it contains a major factual error about the *degree* of taste loss: it labels taste loss as **complete** (“complete loss of taste sensation”), while the patient explicitly reports preserved ability to taste “really, really salty foods” and inability to taste “normal things” (e.g., banana), indicating **partial** loss. It also fails to state the cough is dry/non-productive (though the transcript confirms this), and omits timing/consistency details that are part of the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the gold answer covered: (1) decreased smell (partial), (2) taste loss (mentioned but degree wrong), (3) mild cough. Key points missed: (a) smell loss details—can still smell very strong/very bad odors, (b) taste loss details—can taste very salty foods but not normal foods (banana example), (c) symptom duration of two days, (d) sensory symptoms and cough were consistent over two days, (e) cough is dry/non-productive with no sputum or blood, (f) cough started at the same time as sensory symptoms, (g) no worsening, (h) no identified triggers. Overall, it captures only a minority of the gold answer’s required specifics and misses most “could/could not perceive” details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (reduced smell; mild cough). The statement that taste loss is **complete** is not supported and directly contradicts the patient’s report of preserved salty taste, making this a notable unfaithful/hallucinated detail. The medical labels (anosmia/ageusia) are interpretive but acceptable; the key issue is the unsupported ‘complete loss’ claim.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked sensory and respiratory symptoms and attempts to describe degree of impairment. There is no major off-topic content; the main problem is omission and one incorrect degree statement rather than irrelevance."
