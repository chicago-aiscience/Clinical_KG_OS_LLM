  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: it incorrectly states mucus production lasted the first 2-3 days (Gold and transcript [P-6] specify 4-5 days); omits the description of mucus as 'whitish clear'; does not mention the cough onset exactly two weeks prior [P-2]; fails to detail sore throat specifically resolving in 2-3 days vs. other flu symptoms in 3-4 days; completely omits cough intensity remaining the same [P-7], frequency stable at 3-4 times/hour [P-8,P-9], and spontaneous nature [P-10]; references a non-existent 'KG' for absences.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: initial flu-like symptoms in first 2-3 days (partial), resolution of other symptoms in 3-4 days, transition to dry cough early (imprecise), persistence of cough, chest soreness. Missed: precise 2-week onset [P-2], sore throat specifically [P-13], mucus 'whitish clear' and exactly 4-5 days duration [P-6], cough intensity 'same' [P-7], frequency details [P-8-10], no fevers [P-12], negative COVID test [P-35-36]. Covers roughly 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded (e.g., dry now [P-5], initial flu-like [P-14], resolution [P-14]); however, productive phase duration falsified as 2-3 days vs. transcript's 4-5 [P-6]; introduces unverifiable 'knowledge graph' [KG] not in transcript; denies symptoms citing current questions [D-11 etc.] but Gold specifies timelines; multiple alterations and fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Structured as a timeline addressing symptom progression, initial flu-like, resolution, cough transition, and current status; directly responds to question but omits specifics on mucus details, intensity/frequency changes; no off-topic content."
