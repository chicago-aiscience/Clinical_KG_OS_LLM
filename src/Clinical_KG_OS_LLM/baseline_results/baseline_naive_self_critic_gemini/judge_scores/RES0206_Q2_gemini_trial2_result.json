  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that information about hypertension and inhaler frequency is not in the transcript. This is factually wrong as the transcript explicitly mentions daily use of one inhaler and bi-weekly use of another (P-26), and explains the patient chose lifestyle changes over hypertension medication (P-23, P-24).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover nearly all key points from the Gold Answer, including the specific frequency of inhaler use, the diagnosis of hypertension, the decision to use lifestyle modifications, and the specific activities (walking, weight loss) used as management strategies.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims the information is 'not documented' or 'not mentioned' despite it being clearly present in the provided transcript. This is a failure to accurately reflect the source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the specific components of the question (frequency, management strategies, reasons for no medication) by claiming the information is unavailable."
