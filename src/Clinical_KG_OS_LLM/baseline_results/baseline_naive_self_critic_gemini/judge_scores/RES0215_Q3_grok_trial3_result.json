  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as the diagnosis, aligning with the Gold Answer's 'pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the context of an atopic predisposition.' Core facts match, including triggers and supports, but it omits 'pediatric' and explicit 'atopic predisposition' phrasing, and does not emphasize pertinent negatives or nocturnal symptoms as strongly; minor discrepancies only.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: 1) exercise-triggered [P-3,P-41,P-6] - covered partially [P-3,P-6]; 2) episodic/reversible with rest [P-6,P-33] - covered [P-6]; 3) cold weather [P-38] - covered; 4) multiple settings [P-38] - not explicitly mentioned; 5) seasonal allergies [P-35,P-36] - covered [P-35]; 6) nocturnal episode [P-43,P-44] - missed; 7) pertinent negatives [P-7,P-8,P-10,P-31] - missed. Covers core triggers from question (activity, cold, rest, allergies) ~80%, adds initial symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-3], [P-38], [P-6], [P-35], [P-1], [P-2]); no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by stating the diagnosis (asthma/EIB) and listing specific transcript-supported findings matching the described symptoms (activity trigger, cold worsening, rest resolution, allergies); no off-topic content."
