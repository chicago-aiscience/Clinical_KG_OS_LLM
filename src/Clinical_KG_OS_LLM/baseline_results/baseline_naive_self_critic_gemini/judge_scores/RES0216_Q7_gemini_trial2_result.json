  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the patient's daily walking routine. It states the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine,' whereas the transcript [P-22] and Gold Answer explicitly state the patient reduced their walks from twice daily to once daily. Additionally, it fails to clearly state that the symptoms have been 'staying the same' over the three-day period as requested by the prompt, instead focusing on situational fluctuations.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention that the symptoms have been 'staying the same' or 'steady' over the three days. 2) it misses the reduction in walking frequency (from two walks to one). 3) It misses the fact that the patient has not missed any work as a financial advisor.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits two main faithfulness issues. First, it includes a citation for 'Knowledge graph data [KG],' which is not present in the provided transcript and constitutes a hallucination or an external data leak. Second, it claims the patient maintains their routine, which contradicts the patient's statement in [P-22].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each component of the multi-part question (onset, evolution, exacerbation, and impact on routine), even though the content within those sections is partially inaccurate."
