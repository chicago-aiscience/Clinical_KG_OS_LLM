  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer provides a precise timeline: smoking at ~18 [P-18], teen anxiety attacks [P-21, P-22 with 8-year gap], 10 cigs/day past 2 years then cut to 5 a few months ago [P-18, P-14], father's HA last year [P-8, P-30], recent weeks thesis stress [P-15, P-16], chest pain 1.5 weeks ago first time [P-2, P-17], links to stress/anxiety [P-8, P-22, P-9, P-29]. Generated denies smoking start age specified (contradicts [P-18]), omits 8-year gap/precise smoking escalation/father's HA/recent weeks specificity, adds unverified 'shortness of breath' from past anxiety and [KG:] knowledge graph; core structure present but significant errors/omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: smoking ~18, teen anxiety + doctor, 8yr no anxiety, 2yr 10cigs, few mo cut to 5, father HA, last couple wks thesis time crunch, 1.5wk chest pain new, stress cause?, anxiety return?, alone noticeable. Generated covers: smoking current/quitting, teen anxiety, current academic stress, 1.5wk chest pain; misses smoking start/levels timeline, 8yr gap, father HA, precise recent stress timing, anxiety return/alone details; ~30% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Hallucinations: smoking age 'not specified' (falsely, [P-18] says ~18); past anxiety caused 'short of breath' (inferred loosely from [P-19/20] current, not historical); [KG: stress/smoking contribute] not in transcript; 'physical stress of quitting' plausible inference but adds; citations mostly accurate (e.g., [P-2,6,8,19]) but overall multiple ungrounded claims/details.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around smoking, teen anxiety, academic stress, chest pain onset/timing as per question; includes relationships (stress-anxiety-chest pain, smoking); minor tangents via clinical knowledge/KG but focused on timeline/relations."
