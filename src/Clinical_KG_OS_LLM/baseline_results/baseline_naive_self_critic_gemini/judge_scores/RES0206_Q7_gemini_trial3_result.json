  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the patient's baseline as manageable, the 3-day window of deterioration, and the specific symptoms (cough, sputum changes, hemoptysis, dyspnea).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details present in the gold answer: 1) The specific comparison that this is the 'worst' episode the patient has had (P-3). 2) Baseline functional details like dog walking and rescue inhaler frequency (P-26, P-4). 3) The presence of a possible fever (P-9). 4) The explicit trend that symptoms 'haven't gotten better' (P-2). 5) The specific frequency of past ER visits (twice in three years).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source material. All symptoms and historical facts mentioned are directly supported by the patient's statements in the transcript, with no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's questions regarding evolution and history. However, it is slightly less relevant on the comparison of severity because it omits the patient's own qualitative assessment ('worst I've had') which is a direct answer to that part of the question."
