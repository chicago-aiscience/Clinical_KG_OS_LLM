  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptom combination driving suspicion for COVID-19 as loss of smell, loss of taste, and dry cough (matches P-1 and Gold Answer). It correctly states the clinician linked these to COVID-19 by saying the symptoms were consistent with common COVID symptoms (D-39), and that a swab-based COVID test was ordered (D-39). No contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "It covers the main required elements from the Gold Answer: (1) the triad of symptoms (smell loss, taste loss, dry cough), (2) the doctor’s explicit linkage to COVID-19 symptoms (D-39), and (3) the chosen test method (swab). It omits secondary supporting points emphasized in the Gold Answer (systematic confirmation of absent fever/dyspnea/sore throat/chest pain, the “otherwise pretty well” summary, and self-isolation guidance while awaiting results).",
    "faithfulness": "All core claims are grounded in the transcript (P-1, D-39). The use of medical terms (anosmia/ageusia) is a reasonable paraphrase of the patient’s reported loss of smell/taste, though those exact terms are not spoken. The mention of a “knowledge graph provided” is not supported by the transcript but does not introduce substantive clinical facts. Overall, the answer is largely faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question: it specifies the symptom combination prompting suspicion and explains how the doctor connected symptoms to COVID-19 and selected the swab test. Minimal extraneous content aside from the brief knowledge-graph reference."
