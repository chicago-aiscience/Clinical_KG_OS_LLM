  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer makes a significant medical error by labeling the diagnosis as 'Angina Pectoris'. Angina Pectoris specifically refers to chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart (ischemia). The clinical evidence provided (symptoms resolving with distraction, no worsening with exercise, occurring at rest) and the Gold Answer specifically point away from cardiac ischemia toward a non-cardiac, anxiety-driven cause. While the generated answer mentions 'Psychogenic Chest Pain', lead-listing 'Angina' is factually inconsistent with the logic of the case.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers several key points: the situational pattern (solitude), the breathing mechanism, the history of anxiety, and academic stress. However, it misses two major components of the Gold Answer: the patient's own suspicion that stress is the cause [P-8] and, most importantly, the 'pertinent negatives' (no fever, no exertional worsening, no asthma, etc.) which are vital for supporting a psychogenic diagnosis by ruling out organic pathology.",
    "faithfulness": "The specific observations cited in the bullet points (solitary activities, breathing patterns, history, and academic stress) are all grounded in the transcript and accurately reflected. The only issue is the external diagnostic label 'Angina Pectoris' which is not supported by the clinical data in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is directly relevant to the prompt, attempting to provide both a diagnosis and supporting clinical observations as requested."
