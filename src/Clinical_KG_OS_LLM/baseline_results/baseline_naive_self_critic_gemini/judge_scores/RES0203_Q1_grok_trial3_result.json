  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies partial loss for both smell and taste, with detailed examples (strong bad smells yes, normal no; very salty yes, banana no). Generated Answer correctly identifies partial loss for smell but incorrectly states complete loss for taste, contradicting P-4 and Gold. Cough is noted as mild but misses 'dry' confirmation and other details like non-productive. Uses medical terms not in transcript or Gold. Significant factual errors on taste degree.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3 symptoms for 2 days; smell partial (strong bad yes); taste partial (salty yes, banana no); both consistent; cough mild dry, non-productive, consistent, same onset, no triggers. Generated covers symptoms (3/3), partial smell (yes but no details), taste (wrong degree, no details), mild cough (partial, misses dry/details). Misses duration, consistency, specifics, cough details: covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Cites P-1 accurately for initial reports but ignores P-4 detailing partial losses for smell/taste, leading to hallucinated 'complete loss' for taste (contradicts 'can taste really salty'). 'Dry Cough' header assumes from P-1/P-7 but details like no sputum not included. Medical terms anosmia/ageusia not in transcript. Multiple ungrounded/misrepresented claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists sensory (smell/taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms with degrees and cites transcript, structured to match question; no off-topic content."
