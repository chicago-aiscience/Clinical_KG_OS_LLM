  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three-month onset and the one-month duration of sleep disruption. However, it fails significantly on the final point regarding subjective fevers. It claims the patient did not mention fevers and had not confirmed them, whereas in transcript [P-4], the patient explicitly states she had been 'feeling like hot at night in the past couple days,' which constitutes a subjective fever as noted in the Gold Answer. It also uses 'past few days' for the productive cough instead of the specific 'three days' confirmed in [P-12].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers three of the four specific timeline points requested (onset, sleep disruption, and productivity). It addresses the fourth point (fevers) but provides incorrect information, essentially missing the clinical finding requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to transcript [P-4]. By stating the patient 'does not mention fever,' it contradicts the source text where she describes feeling hot at night. The citations provided for other sections are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly following the requested timeline points. However, the incorrect conclusion in the final section reduces its utility."
