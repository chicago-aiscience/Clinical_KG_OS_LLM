  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies Lipitor as a prescribed medication used for high cholesterol and correctly reports that Tylenol \"helps a little bit.\" However, it inaccurately states Tylenol was used \"to treat a cough\"—the transcript supports Tylenol being taken for feeling feverish/unwell rather than as a cough treatment. This is a meaningful indication error, though the core medication list is largely right.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Lipitor for high cholesterol; (2) Tylenol taken at home; (3) Tylenol provided only partial relief (\"helps a little bit\"). Key points missed/understated: (a) Tylenol was for feverish/unwell symptoms (not cough); (b) patient confirmed Lipitor was the only prescription medication and no other meds were mentioned. (The non-medication relief from expectorating sputum is in the Gold Answer but is not strictly required by the question about medications.)",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is grounded in the transcript with appropriate quotes, but the claim that Tylenol was used to treat the cough is not explicitly supported. The phrase \"provided knowledge graph\" is also not supported by the transcript. These issues reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on current prescribed and OTC medications, their uses, and OTC effectiveness, which directly addresses the question. Minimal extraneous content."
