  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptom combination driving suspicion for COVID-19: loss of smell, loss of taste, and dry cough (matches Gold Answer). It also correctly states the doctor explicitly linked the symptoms to “common covid symptoms” (D-39) and ordered a swab test (D-39). No contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core required elements: (1) the symptom triad prompting suspicion, (2) the doctor’s explicit connection to COVID-19, and (3) the chosen test method (swab). It does not include additional contextual support emphasized in the Gold Answer: the doctor’s systematic confirmation of absent symptoms (fever, dyspnea, sore throat, chest pain), the “otherwise pretty well” summary, and the self-isolation guidance while awaiting results.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (P-1 for symptoms; D-39 for rationale and swab test). Minor ungrounded elements include referencing a “knowledge graph provided” and claiming alignment with a knowledge-graph procedure, which are not present in the transcript. Use of clinical terms (anosmia/ageusia) is inferential but consistent with the patient’s report.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by naming the symptom combination and explaining how the doctor connected the presentation to suspected COVID-19 and selected a swab test. No meaningful tangents."
