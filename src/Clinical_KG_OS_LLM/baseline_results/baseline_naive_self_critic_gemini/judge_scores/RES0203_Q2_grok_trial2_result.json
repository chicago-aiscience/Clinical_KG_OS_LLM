  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the patient tried edibles as a medication/treatment pre-visit, citing [P-34], but this refers to past irregular marijuana use in lifestyle history, not attempts to treat current symptoms; the transcript and Gold Answer confirm the patient tried nothing for symptoms ('No, I haven't tried anything' [P-9]) and takes no medications [P-24]. Doctor's recommendation of COVID test and self-isolation is correct, but misses emphasis on no medication prescribed and other details like result timing or further tests. Significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: patient tried no treatments/meds [D-9/P-9, D-24/P-24]; no medication prescribed; COVID swab test [D-39]; results in 1-2 days [D-39]; self-isolate until results, potentially longer [D-39]; possible other tests/consult [D-40]. Generated covers COVID test and partial self-isolation instructions but wrongly includes edibles, misses no meds/treatments confirmation, result timing, no prescription note, other tests/consult. Covers ~30% accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "Edibles claim [P-34] is verifiable but hallucinates it as a 'treatment tried' for symptoms when context is lifestyle/substance use, not symptom relief; direct question on OTC/treatments answered 'No' [P-9]. COVID test/self-isolate verifiable [D-39]. Introduces hallucinated connection making patient side ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "Structure directly addresses question (pre-visit treatments, doctor's recs/intervention/instructions); content mostly on-topic despite erroneous edibles inclusion as minor off-topic tangent."
