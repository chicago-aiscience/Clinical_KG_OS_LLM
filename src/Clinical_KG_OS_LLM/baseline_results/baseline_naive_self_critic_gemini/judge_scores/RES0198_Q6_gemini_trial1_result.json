{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), the supportive care (hydration and Tylenol Cold), the diagnostic test (swab for COVID-19), and the isolation/public health instructions.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points from the gold answer. It includes the diagnosis, specific supportive care, the swab test, the 48-hour window, isolation, and public health follow-up. It misses two minor details mentioned in the gold answer: that the swab is to be performed 'today' and that symptoms may take 'a few weeks' to resolve.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is entirely faithful to the transcript [D-39]. It does not hallucinate any medical advice or instructions not present in the source text. The mention of a 'knowledge graph' in the intro is an external artifact of the model's prompt but does not impact the faithfulness of the clinical content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address the four components requested in the prompt: diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, and public health guidance."
