  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the dry cough and scratchy throat were initial symptoms occurring together based on P-1, but P-4 explicitly indicates the scratchy throat was noticed first, followed by the cough. It wrongly positions the feeling hot as a subsequent symptom after respiratory issues and malaise/headache, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer note no specific timeline for the hot sensation relative to throat/cough—it was persistent 'all the time' over the 3-4 days as part of the same illness (P-7, P-9; D-58). Introduces fabricated 'Knowledge Graph' associations not in transcript. These are significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: 3-4 days duration (yes), dry cough and scratchy throat as early (partial, wrong order), headache and malaise (yes). Missed/partial: precise sequence from P-4 (throat then cough), fatigue (P-13), detailed hot persistence day/night (P-9), no exact hot timeline but concurrent illness, doctor's 'little bit of fever' summary (D-58), overall progression from localized to systemic. Covers ~50-60% accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in citations like P-1, P-7, but hallucinates entire 'Knowledge Graph' with symptom links (e.g., cough associated with malaise, hot same as fever) not present in transcript. Infers hot as 'following' onset without transcript support (plausible but not verifiable); ignores P-4 sequence. Multiple hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response as ordered symptom progression (1-3) over 3-4 days and explicitly addresses hot sensation's relation to cough/throat timeline, perfectly matching question focus despite inaccuracies."
