  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant logical error regarding the exclusion of cardiac ischemia. It states that 'harder to breathe' contradicts cardiac ischemia, whereas in clinical practice and in the transcript (D-36), the doctor uses the (perceived) absence of breathlessness and absence of pain to lower the likelihood of a cardiac event. Furthermore, 'shortness of breath' is a common symptom of cardiac ischemia, making the generated answer's claim medically incorrect.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The patient's non-compliance with medication (skipping night doses and lack of rescue inhaler refill) which the doctor explicitly highlighted in D-34; 2) The exclusion of new environmental triggers; and 3) The patient's own admission that it might be related to his asthma. It does cover the history of asthma and the nature of the tightness.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is mostly faithful to the transcript but 'hallucinates' the medical logic that shortness of breath contraindicates cardiac ischemia. This reasoning is not present in the transcript; the doctor actually cites a perceived lack of breathlessness as a reason to lower cardiac suspicion.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both the 'what' (symptoms/history) and the 'how' (doctor's reasoning) of the question."
