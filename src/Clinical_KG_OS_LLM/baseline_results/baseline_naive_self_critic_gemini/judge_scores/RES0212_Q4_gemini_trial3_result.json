  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error by claiming that night sweats and weight loss were not screened for by the doctor. The transcript explicitly shows the doctor asking about night sweats in [D-5] and weight loss in [D-6]. It also omits hemoptysis, which the Gold Answer identifies as a key constitutional symptom.",
    "completeness": "The answer is highly incomplete. It misses all 'exposure risks' (sick contacts, travel history, and IV drug use) which were specifically requested in the prompt and detailed in the Gold Answer. It only covers a small fraction of the screening questions mentioned in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source text. It hallucinates a lack of screening for night sweats and weight loss, despite those being clearly present in the provided transcript (D-5, D-6).",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant as it focuses on minor symptoms (nausea, stiff neck) while failing to address the primary components of the question, specifically the 'exposure risks' and the actual constitutional symptoms screened."
