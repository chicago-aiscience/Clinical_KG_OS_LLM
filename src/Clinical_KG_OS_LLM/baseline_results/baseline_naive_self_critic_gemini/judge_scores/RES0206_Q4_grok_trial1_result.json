  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID [D-43]) and test (COVID swab [D-43]), matching the Gold Answer fully on these points. However, it incorrectly states that 'the provided transcript does not contain any specific information regarding the patient's recent social contacts or exposure history,' directly contradicting the transcript ([P-20] details meeting friends for dog walks, one sick, walking too close) and Gold Answer, which emphasizes this as the prompting detail. This is a significant factual error on a core part of the question. Overall, significant contradictions on the third element.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Condition: COVID-19; (2) Test: COVID swab [D-43]; (3) Prompting detail: sick friend exposure during outdoor dog walks, too close despite outdoors [P-20], unsure of friend's COVID test [P-21]; additional screening for symptoms/travel. Generated covers 1 and 2 fully (~30-40% coverage), but completely misses the social contacts/exposure details, which form the bulk of the Gold Answer and question's third part. Covers 20-49% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on condition/test verifiable and accurate [D-43]. However, assertion that transcript lacks info on social contacts/exposure is false—directly contradicted by [D-20]/[P-20]/[D-21]/[P-21], which detail the sick friend exposure. This introduces a major ungrounded (incorrect) claim. Rest mentions symptoms [P-1] accurately but irrelevant to prompting. Multiple ungrounded/incorrect claims about absence of exposure history.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response to the three-part question (condition, test, social contacts detail), stays focused on transcript elements without tangents or off-topic content, perfectly mirroring question structure despite error on third part."
