  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes that BOTH patient (citing [P-1]) and doctor ([D-2], [D-39]) identified COVID-19 as needing to be ruled out. Generated Answer correctly notes doctor identified COVID-19 to rule out ([D-39]) but frames common cold as 'primary condition identified' and omits explicit mention of patient's concern ([P-1]), creating a minor discrepancy in attributing joint identification. Test (swab), turnaround (48 hours), and core instructions (isolation) match exactly with accurate citations. No major errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Both identify COVID-19 to rule out (cites P-1, D-2, D-39) - partially covered (doctor only); (2) COVID swab today - covered (swab, omits 'today'); (3) 48 hours - covered; (4) stay isolated in home/not see anyone + further public health instructions - partially covered (isolation in home, misses 'not see anyone' and public health). Covers ~80-90% of points, with extra on common cold.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: common cold/viral [D-39], COVID rule out/swab/48 hours/isolation [D-39]. Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; patient's COVID concern exists in [P-1] but not cited in Generated (not fabricated). Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around condition/test/time/instructions matching question structure. Minor tangent introducing common cold as 'primary' (true but not central to 'needing to be ruled out'). Perfectly focused on query elements overall."
