  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the mother's suspicion of school as the source [P-1, P-2], absence of school notification [P-39], and lack of specific known sick contacts at school. However, it inaccurately portrays the younger sister as a reported 'potential contact' by the mother, whereas the sister was reported healthy [P-36] and isolation was a doctor recommendation [D-44], not a mother-reported sick contact. It also omits the explicit distinction of no known sick contacts outside school [P-38] and misaligns slightly on external contacts versus Gold. Core facts are consistent, but minor discrepancies exist.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: school as suspected source [P-1,P-2]; no school notification [P-39]; no specific school sick contacts. Missed or partial: explicit 'no known sick outside school, hard to say at school' [P-38]; school's COVID test requirement for return [P-41]; no travel [P-40]; no environmental exposures [P-37]. Adds extraneous sister detail. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims grounded: symptoms post-school [P-1], COVID school suspicion [P-2], no school sick specifics or notification [P-38,P-39]. Sister reference verifiable [P-35,P-36,D-44] but slightly stretched as 'mother reports potential contact' (doctor's advice). Citations mostly accurate [P-1,P-2,D-44]; [D-3] tangential. Minor unverifiable stretch on sister, but mostly grounded, no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses school suspicion, sick contacts (school none known, external minimal), and no school notification. Minor tangents on doctor recommendations and sister isolation, but focused on question elements without significant off-topic content."
