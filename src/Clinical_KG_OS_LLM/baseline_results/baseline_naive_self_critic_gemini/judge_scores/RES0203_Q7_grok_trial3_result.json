  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer states all symptoms began simultaneously two days prior (P-1, P-2; confirmed for cough D-6, P-6), were consistent without worsening or fluctuation (sensory D-5, P-5; cough D-8, P-8), partial sensory loss persisted (P-4), and no prior similar symptoms (D-3, P-3). Generated Answer correctly identifies concurrent onset two days ago (P-1). However, it incorrectly claims no information on worsening/fluctuation despite explicit statements of consistency (P-5, P-8), and wrongly states no information on prior symptoms despite direct denial (P-3). These are significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) simultaneous onset of all three ~2 days ago (P-1,P-2); 2) cough confirmed same time (D-6,P-6); 3) sensory symptoms consistent no fluctuation (D-5,P-5); 4) cough consistent no worsening (D-8,P-8); 5) no intermittent/variable; 6) partial sensory persisted (P-4); 7) never before (D-3,P-3). Generated covers only concurrent onset (partial, misses cough confirmation and details). Misses all progression/consistency points (3-6) and prior history (7). Covers ~20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims verifiable for timing (P-1). However, 'no information on worsening/fluctuation' is false (contradicted by P-5, P-8 stating consistent); 'no info on prior symptoms' contradicted by P-3. These are hallucinated absences of information present in transcript. Multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around question elements: timing of each symptom relative to others, severity/fluctuation, prior experience. No off-topic content; perfectly focused despite inaccuracies."
