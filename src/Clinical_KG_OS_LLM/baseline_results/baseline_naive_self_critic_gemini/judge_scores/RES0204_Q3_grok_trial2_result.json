  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the persistent dry cough (4-5 days, non-improving) and some pertinent negatives (fever/chills [P-13], sore throat [P-9], chest pain [P-15], etc.), and quotes the doctor's statements for X-ray [D-37] and implies COVID testing relevance; however, it mischaracterizes the cough as 'chronic' or 'beyond 5 days' (actually 4-5 days), introduces unsubstantiated differentials (bronchitis, pneumonia, foreign body), references a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph,' alters COVID rationale to 'hallmark symptom of COVID/mild variants' instead of explicit standard protocol [D-39], and uses 'refusal to report' instead of denial. Core facts are mostly consistent with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covers key present symptoms (dry cough persistence [P-2,P-5,P-7], runny nose indirectly); many pertinent negatives (fever/chills, sore throat, chest pain, nausea/vomiting, headache); doctor's X-ray intent [D-37]; partial COVID rationale. Misses: explicit clear nasal discharge emphasis [P-11,P-12], full negatives list (taste/smell [P-10], muscle/back pain [P-14], abdominal pain [P-17]), no sick contacts [P-19,P-22], no travel [P-20], family asthma hx [P-28], novelty of dry cough [P-24], explicit protocol for COVID [D-39]. Covers ~60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like cough details and some negatives verifiable with accurate citations ([P-2],[P-5],[P-13],[P-9],[P-15],[D-37]); however, 'chronic cough beyond 5 days' not in transcript (it's 4-5 days staying same), 'Knowledge Graph' hallucinated, COVID rationale (hallmark/mild COVID/variants) not in transcript—instead, transcript specifies standard protocol for 'anyone with these symptoms' [D-39]; added differentials (bronchitis, pneumonia, foreign body) plausible but not stated; 'refusal to report' misrepresents denial. Some plausible but multiple ungrounded additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how present (persistent cough, runny nose) and absent findings (lists several negatives) led to chest X-ray (to visualize lower tract [D-37]) and COVID swab (to identify etiology despite absences); structured step-by-step rationale perfectly matches question focus with no significant off-topic content."
