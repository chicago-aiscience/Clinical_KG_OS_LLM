  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies decreased smell and a mild cough. However, it incorrectly states the patient had a **complete loss of taste**; the transcript indicates **partial taste loss** (can taste very salty foods but not normal flavors like banana) [P-4]. It also fails to state the cough was explicitly **dry/non-productive** (confirmed in [P-7]) and implies less detail than the gold standard regarding symptom course.",
    "completeness": "It mentions the three main symptoms (smell change, taste change, cough) but omits multiple key qualifying details present in the gold answer/transcript: (1) smell loss was partial with ability to smell very strong/bad odors [P-4]; (2) taste loss was partial with ability to taste very salty foods and inability to taste banana/normal foods [P-4]; (3) symptoms were consistent over two days [P-2, P-5, P-8]; (4) cough started at same time as sensory symptoms [P-6]; (5) cough was dry/non-productive with no sputum/blood [P-7]; (6) no triggers identified [P-21]. Overall coverage is well under 80%.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in [P-1], but the claim of **complete** taste loss is not supported and directly conflicts with [P-4]. Use of diagnostic labels (anosmia/ageusia) is interpretive but acceptable; the bigger issue is the incorrect degree of taste impairment.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the patient’s sensory and respiratory symptoms and attempts to describe degree of impairment; no major irrelevant content."
