  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer. It correctly identifies the timeline and the comparative symptoms without introducing errors.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the majority of the key points, including the Friday/Saturday activities, the discovery, the container, the prior episode's symptoms, and the engorgement comparison. However, it misses the specific geographic location (Strathroy) and the doctor's clinical estimation of the timeline (at least 72 hours) which were included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is entirely grounded in the transcript. All details provided about the patient's symptoms and the tick's appearance match the dialogue provided.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses both parts of the question (the timeline and the comparison to the prior bite) without irrelevant information."
