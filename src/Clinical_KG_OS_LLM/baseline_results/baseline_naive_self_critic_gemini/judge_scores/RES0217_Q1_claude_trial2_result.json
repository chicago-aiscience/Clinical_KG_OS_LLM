  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) with proper citations. However, it contains a significant factual error regarding joint pain. The answer states the patient 'reported' joint pain rather than denied it, when the transcript clearly shows [D-7] doctor asks 'do you have any other joint pain?' and [P-7] patient responds 'No.' This is a direct contradiction of the source material. The fever and headache denials are correctly stated.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main local symptoms but lacks some detail present in the Gold Answer, such as the tick being 'stuck pretty good,' the clarification that soreness was 'not the joint itself,' and the explicit denial of the bullseye/target rash. It correctly identifies the three systemic symptoms screened (joint pain, fever, headaches) but mischaracterizes the joint pain response. Missing are details about the patient's overall health status ('totally fine,' 'pretty healthy') mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains one major hallucination: claiming the patient 'reported' joint pain when she explicitly denied it ([P-7]: 'No'). The claim that 'She described the area behind her left knee as sore, red, and tender' conflates local symptoms with joint pain, which the doctor specifically distinguished in [P-1] where the patient states 'not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin.' The other claims about local symptoms and fever/headache denials are properly grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: local symptoms at the bite site and systemic symptoms screened for. However, the mischaracterization of joint pain as 'reported' rather than 'denied' represents a fundamental misunderstanding of what the question asked for (symptoms the patient 'denied experiencing'). Despite this error, the overall structure remains relevant to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) at the tick bite site but contains a critical factual error by stating the patient 'reported' joint pain when she explicitly denied it ([P-7]: 'No'). This directly contradicts the question's requirement to identify symptoms 'the patient denied experiencing.' The answer correctly notes the patient denied fever and headaches but lacks important details from the Gold Answer such as the explicit denial of the bullseye rash and clarifications about the nature of the soreness. The conflation of local skin symptoms with joint pain represents both a factual error and a hallucination, as the patient specifically distinguished these in [P-1]."
