  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors regarding the timeline. It attributes the 'raspy cough' to Sunday, while the transcript (P-3) and Gold Answer specify Friday. It attributes the 'fever' to Sunday, while the transcript (P-5, P-8) and Gold Answer specify Monday. It also fails to correctly date the chest pain, which the patient noticed 'over the last day' (Tuesday).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is missing key chronological points from the Gold Answer: it omits the runny nose from one week prior, the specific Friday onset of the cough, and the Monday onset of the fever. It covers approximately 40-50% of the timeline points accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misinterprets the transcript's timeline. It cites [P-5] for a Sunday fever, but the text in [P-5] says 'the next day... I started getting fever', referring to the day after Sunday (Monday). It also overlooks the specific mention of Friday in [P-3].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the prompt's request for a timeline and clinical progression, following the requested structure, although the content within that structure is inaccurate."
