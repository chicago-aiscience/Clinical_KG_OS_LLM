  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer specifies the patient's medication regimen as multivitamins only [P-40], notes she is pre-diabetic but not on prescriptions [P-33], and denies hypertension [P-34] and cholesterol issues [P-35]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states there is no current medication regimen or indication of any medications, missing the multivitamins entirely and contradicting both the Gold and transcript [P-40]. Allergy to penicillin [P-37] and rash reaction [P-38] match the Gold Answer. This represents a significant factual error on the primary component of the question (medication regimen).",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: multivitamins only [P-40]; pre-diabetic monitoring but no prescriptions [P-33]; no hypertension [P-34]; no cholesterol issues [P-35]; penicillin allergy [P-37]; rash reaction [P-38]; no breathing trouble [P-39]. Generated covers penicillin allergy and rash reaction fully but entirely misses or incorrectly denies the medication regimen details (multivitamins, pre-diabetic status, denials of other conditions), covering only about 30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on penicillin allergy [P-37] and rash [P-38] are directly verifiable in transcript. However, 'no current medication regimen' and 'no indication of any current medications' contradict [P-40] where patient reports taking multivitamins. Reference to a 'knowledge graph' is hallucinated as none is provided in the source materials, only transcript. Gallbladder mention [P-30] is verifiable but irrelevant here. Multiple ungrounded/false claims.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly structures response around the three-part question (medication regimen, drug allergy, adverse reaction) with clear headings, no major off-topic content despite minor irrelevant gallbladder note; perfectly focused on query."
