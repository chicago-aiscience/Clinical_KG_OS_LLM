  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fully aligns with the Gold Answer on all core facts: exposure (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), tick attachment >72 hours [D-6], geographic risk (Strathroy concerning per map [D-13]), prior history (10 years ago tick bite with bullseye rash requiring antibiotics [P-3]). It correctly notes the 'despite' factors (not deer tick [P-5], no current rash). Phrasing like 'known susceptibility' is a minor interpretive summary consistent with prior reaction but not contradictory. No factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers 100% of the four primary key points (exposure history, duration, geo risk, prior history) and the 'despite' counterpoints. Minor misses: explicit patient uncertainty on attachment timing [P-1], 'along the creek' [P-12], patient's comment on all ticks as carriers [P-5], lab identification [D-6], and 'safer than not' phrasing [D-18]. Still covers 80-99% of Gold's content.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims (e.g., [P-1], [D-6], [D-13], [P-3], [P-5]) directly verifiable in transcript. Doctor's prioritization of risks despite visuals grounded in [D-6], [D-13], [D-18]. Minor unverifiable: 'knowledge graph information' (absent from transcript); 'known susceptibility' plausible from prior history but interpretive. No hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses the question by structuring response around the exact combination of four factors (exposure, duration, geo, prior) leading to prophylaxis despite non-deer tick appearance and absent rash, with explicit reference to overriding context."
