  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the deprioritized condition as a cardiac ischemic picture/cardiac ischemia, consistent with [D-36]. It accurately reports the clinician’s rationale that the patient did not “really get out of breath with exercise” and that there was no associated chest pain, both supported by [D-36] and patient statements (e.g., [P-1], [P-5]). No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present, though it omits other pertinent negatives rather than misstating them.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) condition = cardiac ischemia/cardiac ischemic picture; (2) chest complaint framed as tightness without pain; (3) clinician cited not really getting out of breath with exercise.\nKey points missed: explicit mention of absent associated symptoms the clinician screened for (anxiety, sweating, feeling of impending doom) [D-6]/[P-6]. It also does not clearly articulate the ‘tightness (pleuritic/inspiratory) rather than pain’ framing as a positive feature beyond simply noting lack of pain. Overall, it captures some but not all of the evidence requested (especially the “absence of certain symptoms” component).",
    "faithfulness": "All statements made are grounded in the transcript: cardiac ischemia placed lower [D-36]; lack of classic exertional breathlessness per clinician [D-36]; absence of pain [D-36], corroborated by patient [P-1], [P-5]. No hallucinated symptoms or diagnoses are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses what condition was lowered on the differential and provides symptom-based justification. It stays on-topic with no extraneous material."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded identification of cardiac ischemia and two supporting symptom features, but incomplete because it omits key screened negative symptoms (anxiety/sweating/impending doom) emphasized in the Gold Answer."
