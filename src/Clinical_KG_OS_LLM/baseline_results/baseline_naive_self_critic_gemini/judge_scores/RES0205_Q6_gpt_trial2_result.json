  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer. The transcript explicitly contains the doctor’s plan at the end: to listen to the patient’s heart and lungs, do a quick physical exam, then consult the doctor they are working with, review what was discussed, and return to discuss next steps (D-37). The Generated Answer wrongly claims no plan/exam/next-steps process is present and incorrectly states the transcript ends at P-35, despite additional turns through D-38.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed entirely: (1) specified exam components (auscultation of heart and lungs; quick physical exam), (2) consult supervising physician, (3) review the history together, (4) return to patient to discuss where to go from here/next steps, (5) this was foreshadowed at the beginning (D-1), (6) no diagnosis/medication given yet, and (7) patient agreement to plan. The Generated Answer covers none of these.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not grounded in the transcript. It asserts the plan and exam are not included and claims the transcript ends at P-35, which is directly contradicted by the provided transcript (D-36 to D-38, including D-37 stating the plan). This constitutes clear unfaithfulness to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked elements (plan, physical exam components, process for next steps) but fails to provide them, instead incorrectly denying their presence. It is on-topic but does not meaningfully answer the question."
