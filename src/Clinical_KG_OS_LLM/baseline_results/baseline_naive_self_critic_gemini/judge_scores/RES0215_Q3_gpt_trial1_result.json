  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies asthma, specifically exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, which matches the Gold Answer’s diagnosis (pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction). The supporting findings it cites (exercise trigger [P-3], cold worsening [P-38], improvement with rest [P-6], and seasonal allergies [P-35]) are all consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. No contradictory or incorrect clinical claims are made.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) exercise-triggered symptoms [P-3], (2) episodic/reversible nature with rest [P-6], (3) worse in cold weather [P-38], (4) seasonal allergies/atopy [P-35].\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (1) symptoms across multiple settings [P-38] (the question explicitly includes this), (2) nocturnal wheezy episode/trouble falling asleep [P-43, P-44], (3) pertinent negatives supporting non-infectious etiology (no fever [P-7], no runny nose [P-8], no sick contacts [P-10], no phlegm [P-31]).\nOverall, it captures the core rationale but omits several supporting transcript findings emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are supported by the transcript: wheeze/SOB/cough [P-1], difficulty taking deep breaths [P-2], exertional dyspnea [P-3], cold weather worsening [P-38], rest-relief pattern [P-6], and seasonal allergies [P-35]. There are no clear hallucinations or unsupported assertions.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question: it provides the most likely diagnosis and cites transcript findings supporting that conclusion. Minimal extraneous content."
