  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes that BOTH patient (P-1: 'in case I have covid') and doctor (D-2, D-39) identified COVID-19 as needing to be ruled out. Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as needing to be ruled out (citing D-39) and test/instructions/TAT match exactly, but introduces 'common cold' as doctor's primary diagnosis (accurate from D-39) and does not explicitly note patient's identification of COVID concern, creating a minor discrepancy on 'both' identifying it.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: COVID-19 by both (P-1,D-2,D-39), swab test 'today' (D-39), 48 hours (D-39), isolate at home/not see others/further public health instructions (D-39). Generated covers COVID to rule out, swab, 48h, isolate at home; misses explicit 'both' (patient's role), 'today', full isolation phrasing ('not see anyone'), public health follow-up. Covers ~85% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated (common cold/viral [D-39], COVID rule-out/swab/48h/isolation [D-39], symptoms) directly verifiable in transcript [D-39 primarily]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured bullet-point style directly addressing the four question elements (condition to rule out, test, TAT, instructions) with no off-topic content, perfectly matching question focus."
