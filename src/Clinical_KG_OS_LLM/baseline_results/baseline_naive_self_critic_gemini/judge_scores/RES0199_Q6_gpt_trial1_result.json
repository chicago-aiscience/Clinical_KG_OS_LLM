  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly states the COVID-19 swab was ordered, isolation for 14 days was advised, contact tracing would occur if the test is positive, and lists the same supportive measures (hydration, nutritious food, sleep/rest, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches/joint pains). Minor overgeneralization: it says NSAIDs for “any pain,” whereas the transcript specifies muscle aches/joint pains (“anything like that”), but this is not a substantive contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Includes all items explicitly requested in the question (test ordered, 14-day isolation duration, condition for public health contact tracing, and supportive care recommendations). However, compared with the Gold Answer’s full plan, it omits: expected turnaround time for results (24–48 hours) and the doctor’s note that if not COVID it could be another viral illness (and that management is supportive regardless).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly grounded in [D-52]. The only slight stretch is interpreting “Tylenol or NSAIDs…for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that” as “any pain,” which is plausible but not verbatim. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the management plan components asked: diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing trigger, and supportive care. No notable irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The answer is accurate and highly relevant, covering all requested plan elements, but it misses a couple of additional management details present in the gold answer (test turnaround time and alternative viral-illness note) and slightly overgeneralizes the NSAID indication."
