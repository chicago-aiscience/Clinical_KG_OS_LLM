  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer partially matches Gold by correctly identifying dry cough, fever, and fatigue as reported symptoms with citations, but inaccurately presents shortness of breath as definitively reported rather than uncertain (P-8), omits key reported symptoms like decreased appetite (P-15), possible loss of taste (P-17), and mild runny nose (P-16), and significantly errs by claiming no explicit patient denials for chest pain (P-13 'No'), sore throat (P-14), chills/night sweats (P-19 'No'), wheezing (P-7), sputum/blood (P-6), and GI issues (P-22 'No', P-23 'No') when transcript shows clear denials; also adds hallucinated 'knowledge graph' reference to asthma.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: dry cough progression (partial), fever, fatigue (3/7 reported symptoms); shortness of breath noted but misrepresented; misses runny nose, decreased appetite, loss of taste entirely; covers almost none of the denied symptoms list (sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, skin changes, GI specifics, N/V, etc.), instead listing asked symptoms without affirming denials; covers ~20-40% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded with citations (e.g., cough P-1/P-5, fever P-1/P-2), but hallucinates 'knowledge graph link to asthma' not in transcript; misrepresents P-8 as reporting harder breathing rather than uncertainty; incorrectly asserts 'no explicit patient denials' despite multiple 'No' responses (P-6,7,13,14,19,22,23); misattributes D-22 phrasing while patient explicitly denies (P-22 'No'); multiple inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and doctor-asked symptoms as per question; minor irrelevant tangent with asthma knowledge graph; addresses core question but incomplete on denials."
