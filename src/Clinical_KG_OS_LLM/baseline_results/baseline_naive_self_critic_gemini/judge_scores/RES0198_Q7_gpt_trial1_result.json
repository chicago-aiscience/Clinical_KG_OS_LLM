  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states symptom onset was about one week prior to the visit. However, it is factually wrong on the core requested elements: (1) it claims there is no evidence which symptom appeared first, but the patient explicitly states congestion came first (“felt pretty stuffy at first” [P-3]); (2) it claims there was no change in predominant symptom, but the patient explicitly reports a shift to predominant rhinorrhea (“now it’s mostly running” [P-3]); (3) it concludes symptoms were intermittent based on “on and off” [P-1], but the patient clarifies they have been “pretty constant for the past week” [P-8]. These are major contradictions to the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the three components asked (first symptom, evolution of predominant symptom, constant vs intermittent) and mentions timing. However, it misses/contradicts key Gold Answer points: initial symptom was congestion, predominant symptom shifted to rhinorrhea, overall pattern was constant despite early “on and off,” and symptoms were not improving. It also omits the Gold Answer’s note that decongestants may have influenced the shift. Overall coverage of Gold Answer key points is poor.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: it asserts no evidence for which symptom started first and no change in predominance, both directly contradicted by [P-3]. It also labels the symptoms as intermittent while ignoring the direct clarification of constancy in [P-8]. While it does not introduce many new fabricated facts, it substantially misrepresents the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question (chronology, predominant symptom change, and constancy/intermittency) without irrelevant tangents."
