  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the quality of the pain (sharp, strong, uncomfortable), the duration (20 minutes), and the total history (1.5 weeks). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the resolution of the pain, stating it does not resolve without intervention, whereas the transcript/Gold Answer state it resolves or goes unnoticed when the patient is talking to people or doing tasks. It also incorrectly attributes the timing of the pain to anxiety attacks based on a misinterpretation of P-20 (which referred to heart fluttering, not chest pain).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention that the pain resolves during social interaction or hands-on tasks, it does not mention that the pain occurs at rest, it omits the fact that the pain does not worsen with exercise, and it misses the lack of preceding injury or prior history.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations and contradictions relative to the transcript. It claims the pain doesn't resolve on its own, which is contradicted by P-9. It misinterprets P-20 to claim the chest pain only happens during anxiety attacks, when the patient was actually discussing heart palpitations in that specific turn. There is also a minor citation error (attributing 'sharp, strong' to P-2 instead of P-3).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing the specific categories requested in the question (quality, duration, occurrence, and resolution)."
