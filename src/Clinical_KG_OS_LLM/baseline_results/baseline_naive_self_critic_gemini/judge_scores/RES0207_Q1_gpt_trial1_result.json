  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All items the Generated Answer states are supported by the transcript: sudden shortness of breath on waking [P-1], seizure the prior night with known epilepsy [P-8], and measured temperature 37.4 [P-5]. However, the Gold Answer specifies additional respiratory detail (new cough, dry/no sputum, sudden onset) and timing/context for fever (measured that morning, described as mild, in °C). The Generated Answer is not factually wrong, but it under-specifies what was reported and could be interpreted as implying SOB was the only respiratory symptom.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) sudden-onset shortness of breath; (2) seizure the previous night + epilepsy; (3) temperature value 37.4.\nMissed key Gold Answer elements: cough at presentation (and that it was dry/no sputum); the approximate onset timing (~3 hours); fever measurement context (that it was checked that morning, described as mild) and unit (°C). Pertinent negatives listed in the Gold Answer were also omitted (not strictly required by the question, but included in Gold).",
    "faithfulness": "No hallucinations detected. Every claim in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript (SOB [P-1], seizure/epilepsy [P-8], temperature 37.4 [P-5]).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptom, objective fever measurement) with no unrelated content, but it does not fully enumerate the respiratory symptoms present in the transcript."

  "summary": "The answer is faithful and relevant and includes SOB, seizure/epilepsy, and the 37.4 temperature reading, but it is incomplete because it omits the cough details (dry/no sputum) and other key contextual specifics highlighted in the Gold Answer."
