  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript: physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab and labs as tests, consultation with attending, disposition criteria based on vitals and labs, and clinical impression of COPD exacerbation triggered by infection. No errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points from Gold Answer: examinations (physical exam with vitals/chest), tests (COVID swab, labs), clinical impression, consultations (attending), and disposition criteria (vitals/labs). Minor omission of explicit temperature reference and patient agreement, but these are not core to the doctor's plan.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in [D-43] of the transcript with accurate citations; no hallucinations or unverifiable details; paraphrases like 'healthy enough to go home' align with 'good to go home'.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response around examinations, tests, consultations, and admission/discharge criteria, with no off-topic content."
