  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely factually incorrect compared with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It incorrectly states that no diagnostic tests were ordered, but the doctor explicitly ordered a chest X-ray and a COVID swab (D-37). It incorrectly states there were no self-isolation instructions, but the doctor instructed the patient (if discharged) to stay away from everyone including his wife and self-isolate as much as possible (D-37). It incorrectly states there was no timeline for results, but the doctor said results should come out in 24–48 hours (D-37). It also misses/denies that public health would contact the patient if positive (D-37). The only correct element is that a physical exam was planned (D-38; also referenced in D-37).",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: (1) physical exam planned (partially).\nKey points missed/incorrectly negated: (1) chest exam focus (D-37), (2) chest X-ray order and rationale (D-37), (3) COVID swab order (D-37), (4) self-isolation instructions including staying away from wife (D-37), (5) results timeline 24–48 hours (D-37), (6) public health nurse follow-up if positive (D-37), (7) disposition decision based on results (D-37). Overall, it covers only a small fraction of the required plan.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements directly conflict with the transcript (e.g., claiming no imaging/testing ordered and no isolation instructions or results timeline, all of which are explicitly stated in D-37). Additionally, referencing a “knowledge graph” is unsupported by the provided transcript. Although it does not add many new clinical facts, its repeated denials of clearly present content make it poorly grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is organized around the exact elements asked (tests, exam, isolation, timeline, admission vs discharge criteria), so it is topically aligned. However, because it repeatedly asserts that key items were not mentioned (when they were), it does not effectively address the question’s information needs."
