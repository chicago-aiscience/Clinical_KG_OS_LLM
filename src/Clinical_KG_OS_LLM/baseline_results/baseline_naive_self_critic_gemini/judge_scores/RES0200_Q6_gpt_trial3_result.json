  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor’s diagnosis (COPD exacerbation) and accurately lists the key elements in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function tests, ABG, chest X-ray, COVID swab, oxygen saturation check with supplemental oxygen as needed, continuation of bronchodilators, and addition of steroids and antibiotics. Minor issue: it labels monitoring as “Vital Signs” even though the transcript explicitly mentions only oxygen saturation monitoring in [D-52] (other vitals are not stated there).",
    "completeness": "Covers most key items from the Gold Answer: labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG), COVID swab with intent to rule out COVID, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring with oxygen as needed, and therapies (continue bronchodilators, add steroids and antibiotics). Misses the additional monitoring advice noted in the Gold Answer from [D-37] about ongoing blood pressure monitoring after self-discontinuation of antihypertensive medication.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by [D-52]. The only mild overreach is the phrasing “Vital Signs” monitoring, which implies broader monitoring than explicitly stated (oxygen saturation). Otherwise no clear hallucinated tests, imaging, or treatments.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing lab tests, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions for the COPD exacerbation. No meaningful tangents."
