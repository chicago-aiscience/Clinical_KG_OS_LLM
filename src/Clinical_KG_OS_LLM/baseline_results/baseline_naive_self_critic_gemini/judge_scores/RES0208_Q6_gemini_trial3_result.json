  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is highly inaccurate. It explicitly states that the transcript does not mention diagnostic tests, self-isolation instructions, or timelines, all of which are clearly provided in turn [D-37] of the transcript. It fails to identify the chest X-ray and COVID-19 swab mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer is missing almost all key components from the Gold Answer: the specific tests (X-ray, swab), the isolation details (avoiding the wife), the 24-48 hour timeline, and the mention of the public health nurse. It only successfully identifies that a physical exam was planned.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on faithfulness by claiming information is absent from the transcript when it is present. This represents a failure to ground the response in the provided text, particularly the crucial summary turn [D-37].",
    "relevance": "While the Generated Answer uses the correct headings and structure requested by the question, the content provided within those headings is factually wrong and does not actually provide the requested management plan details."
