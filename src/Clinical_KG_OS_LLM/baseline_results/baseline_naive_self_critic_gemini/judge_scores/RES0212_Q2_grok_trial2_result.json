  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the patient is not taking any medications currently [P-29], matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly claims the patient 'has not reported... any medications previously prescribed,' overlooking the explicit mention of previous prescriptions for eczema cream when severe [P-23]. It also fails to acknowledge current use of moisturizing creams for eczema [P-23], which Gold Answer identifies as a current treatment. Recreational substances are noted but not fully aligned with Gold's detail. These omissions and the false denial of prior prescriptions represent significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) No current medications [P-29]; 2) Eczema history with current moisturizing creams [P-22, P-23]; 3) Previous prescribed creams for eczema [P-23]; 4) No drug allergies [P-28]; 5) Possible minor cat allergy, no meds [P-27]; 6) Condoms, no hormonal birth control [P-45]; 7) Marijuana vaping every ~2 weeks [P-36,37]; 8) Alcohol 5-6 beers on weekends [P-41,42]; 9) No OTC cough remedies. Generated covers 1) no current meds and partially 7) recreational use (marijuana, alcohol, vaping). Misses 2-6,8-9 entirely. Covers ~25-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim of no current medications is verifiable [P-29]. Recreational substance use is accurately grounded [P-36-42]. However, the assertion that no previous medications were mentioned is false/hallucinated, as P-23 directly describes prior prescriptions for eczema cream. Evidence citations [D-17, D-19] are tangential (symptom absence, not meds) and do not support medication status claims. Multiple inaccurate claims about absence of prior meds indicate hallucination by omission/denial.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by stating current status (no prescribed meds) and touching on prior absence (though incorrectly), with evidence tied to the transcript. Minor tangents on symptoms are present but focused on supporting no-medication claim; no major off-topic content."
