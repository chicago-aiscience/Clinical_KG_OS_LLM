{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as bacterial bronchitis or pneumonia, which aligns with the Gold Answer's 'acute lower respiratory tract infection'. However, it makes a medically over-confident claim that greenish sputum 'distinguishes' bacterial from viral infections, whereas the Gold Answer correctly hedges that it 'does not definitively confirm' it. It also misses the significance of the acute worsening of a chronic cough.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to cite the patient's actual confirmation of feeling 'hot at night' [P-4] as the evidence for fever, instead citing the doctor's questions [D-4, D-5]. It also omits the doctor's summary [D-47] and the concluding disclaimer regarding the lack of objective tests (vitals, imaging).",
    "faithfulness": "There is a significant hallucination/artifact where the answer references a '[Knowledge Graph]' that is not present in the transcript or prompt. Additionally, it fails to ground the 'subjective fever' evidence in the patient's actual statement [P-4], inaccurately attributing the evidence to the doctor's inquiry and the patient's fatigue [P-19].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the diagnosis and the three clinical features requested in the prompt."
