  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies seasonal allergies (P-35, P-36), recurrent viral infections (P-15), and cold weather sensitivity (P-38) as contributing to airway hypersensitivity/hyperreactivity and exercise-induced symptoms, aligning with Gold's atopic profile and triggers. However, it contains a significant factual error by claiming new carpets are not mentioned in the transcript (falsely limiting to P-1 to P-43), contradicting Gold and transcript (P-54 explicitly states new carpets six months ago as potential irritant). It also omits Gold's links to childhood asthma, bronchospasm, other environmental assessments (P-53 to P-57), and precise collective hyperresponsiveness framing.",
    "completeness": "Covers Gold's key points on seasonal allergies (atopic constitution), recurrent virals (airway inflammation), cold weather (trigger), and exercise/rest pattern (P-3, P-6, P-41); partially covers collective relation to vulnerability. Misses: new carpets as irritant (P-54), no temporal link, other env factors (no smoking P-53, no pets P-55, no stoves P-56, air filters P-57), specific asthma association, and full 'atopic predisposition with hyperresponsive airways' synthesis. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: allergies (P-35/36), virals (P-15), cold (P-38), exercise (P-3/6/41). Hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' references (not in transcript) as support multiple times. Falsely claims carpets absent from transcript (error, present at P-54). No other fabrications, but multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around question's four factors (allergies, virals, carpets, cold) and their relation to exercise-induced wheezing/distress, with clear conclusion tying to pattern; minor tangents include extra current symptom details (relevant context) and Knowledge Graph mentions."
