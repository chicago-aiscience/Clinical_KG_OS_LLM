  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies onset 4-5 days ago with wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths [P-2]; Generated mentions ~5 days with wheezing [P-1] and out of breath [P-3], minor omission of 'difficulty taking deep breaths'. Trigger playing tag matches [P-3]. Fluctuating pattern and resolution on rest/recurrence on activity match [P-5,P-6]. Cough emergence: Gold implies recent after wheezing/SOB, non-productive [P-31]; Generated says 'developed alongside' [P-1], slight discrepancy, misses non-productive. Nocturnal matches [P-43,P-44]. Adds colder weather as trigger [P-38] (Gold doesn't emphasize as initial trigger). Misses pertinent negatives (no cyanosis [P-32], no fever [P-7], fine otherwise [P-9]). Core facts correct, minor discrepancies. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: 1. Onset 4-5 days [P-1] - covered. 2. Trigger tag [P-3] - covered. 3. Wheezing + diff deep breaths [P-2] - wheezing covered, diff deep breaths implied via SOB but not explicit. 4. Fluctuating [P-5] - covered. 5. Resolve own/rest, recur activity [P-6] - covered. 6. Cough recent/after, non-productive [P-1,P-31] - recent cough covered, misses 'after' nuance and non-productive. 7. Nocturnal wheeziness/trouble asleep [P-43,P-44] - covered. 8. Negatives (cyanosis, fever, fine) - not covered. Covers ~85% of key points. Score: 4.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims verifiable: onset [P-1], trigger [P-3], fluctuating [P-5,P-6], cough [P-1], nocturnal [P-43,P-44]. Colder weather from [P-38] ('worse' not initial trigger). Hallucinations: 'clinical knowledge graph' referenced twice ('supports progression', 'coexists with cough/sleep disturbances') - not in transcript, fabricated external source. SOB cited [P-6] accurate. Multiple hallucinated facts via graph. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Structure directly addresses question: onset/trigger, cough emergence, fluctuating episodes, nocturnal episode. Cold weather relevant from transcript. Graph mentions slightly off-topic but minor. Perfectly focused overall. Score: 4."
