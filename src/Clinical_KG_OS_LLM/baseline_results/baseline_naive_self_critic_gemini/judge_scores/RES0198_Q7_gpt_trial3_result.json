  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely inconsistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It incorrectly states there is “no specific evidence” about which symptom appeared first, but the patient explicitly says it was “pretty stuffy at first” [P-3]. It incorrectly denies any shift in predominant symptom, but the patient states “now it’s mostly running” [P-3], indicating a shift from congestion to rhinorrhea. It also concludes the symptoms were intermittent (“on and off”), ignoring the later clarification that symptoms were “pretty constant for the past week” [P-8]. Only the onset timing (~1 week) matches [P-1, P-2].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered vs missed:\n- Covered: symptoms began ~1 week prior.\n- Missed/incorrect: congestion was first symptom; predominant symptom shifted from congestion to runny nose; pattern clarified as overall constant despite initial “on and off”; mention that symptoms were not improving; possible influence of decongestants on congestion/runny nose.\nOverall, it fails to capture most required elements (first symptom, change over week, constant vs intermittent as clarified).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: claiming no evidence for first symptom and no change in predominance directly contradicts [P-3]. Labeling symptoms as intermittent contradicts the explicit “pretty constant” statement [P-8]. The only clearly grounded element is the ~1-week onset from [P-1, P-2].",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to address all components of the question (onset, which came first, progression, and constancy vs intermittency) and contains no major tangential content, but the content provided is mostly incorrect."
