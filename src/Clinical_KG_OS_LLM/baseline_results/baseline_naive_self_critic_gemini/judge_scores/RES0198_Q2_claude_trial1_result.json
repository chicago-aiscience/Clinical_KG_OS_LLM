  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies decongestants as the medication tried (matching P-10), accurately quotes the patient's 'worked a little bit' assessment (P-10), and correctly identifies Tylenol Cold as the recommended OTC medication (D-39). All core facts align with the Gold Answer, though with less contextual detail.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main components requested: prior medication (decongestants), patient assessment (worked a little bit), and doctor's recommendation (Tylenol Cold). However, it omits important contextual details present in the Gold Answer: the patient's reasoning about why it worked (nose went from stuffy to runny), the doctor's recommendation to stay well hydrated, and the timeline expectation of 'a few weeks' for symptom resolution. Covers approximately 70% of key information.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The medication tried [P-10], patient assessment [P-10], and doctor's recommendation [D-39] all correctly reference the source material. No hallucinated content detected. The answer stays grounded in what was explicitly stated in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what medication was tried, patient's effectiveness assessment, and doctor's OTC recommendation going forward. All information provided is on-topic with no tangential content. The bullet-point format efficiently organizes the response to match the multi-part question structure."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully grounded in the transcript, correctly identifying the decongestant medication tried, the patient's 'worked a little bit' assessment, and Tylenol Cold as the recommended treatment. It directly addresses all components of the question with perfect relevance. However, it lacks important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including the patient's reasoning about effectiveness, hydration recommendations, and timeline expectations, resulting in moderate completeness. The answer demonstrates strong correctness and faithfulness but could be more comprehensive."
