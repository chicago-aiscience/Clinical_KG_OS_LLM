  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all key facts from the Gold Answer, including exposure (hiking Friday/gardening Saturday), tick duration (>72 hours), geographic risk (Strathroy concerning per map), and prior history (10-year-old tick bite with bullseye rash requiring antibiotics). It correctly addresses the 'even though' aspects (not deer tick-like, no current rash) by noting prioritization of cumulative risks. No factual errors or contradictions; minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'known susceptibility' vs. 'prior history') are consistent with intent. Score: 5.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: exposure history [P-1], duration estimate [D-6], geographic risk [D-13/P-12], prior history [P-3]; addresses despite clauses. Missed minor details: patient's uncertainty ('don't know when got it' [P-1]), 'along the creek' [P-12], patient's comment on all ticks as carriers [P-5], sending tick to lab [D-6/D-18], 'safer than not' phrasing [D-18]. Covers ~90% of Gold's content. Score: 4.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims verifiable: [P-1], [D-6], [D-13], [P-3], not deer tick [P-5/D-5], no rash [P-6]. Interpretations (cumulative risk prioritization, 'susceptibility') plausible and grounded in doctor's statements [D-6/D-13/D-18]. Minor issue: unprompted 'knowledge graph information' not in transcript (unverifiable). No hallucinations in core content. Score: 4.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the four specified factors (exposure, duration, geography, prior history), explicitly addresses 'even though' qualifiers in reference section, perfectly matching question focus with no tangents. Score: 5"
