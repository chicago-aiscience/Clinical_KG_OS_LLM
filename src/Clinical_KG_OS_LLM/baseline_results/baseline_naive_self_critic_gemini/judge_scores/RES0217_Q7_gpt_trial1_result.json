  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports that the patient was hiking on Friday and gardening on Saturday, was unsure when the tick attached, noticed soreness/redness/tenderness behind the left knee, removed the tick, and brought it in a plastic container. It also correctly contrasts the prior episode (~10 years ago) involving a target/bullseye rash and antibiotics, with the current episode having milder/local symptoms and less engorgement. Minor issue: it frames exposure as a “two-day period,” which slightly downplays the clinician’s concern that attachment could be >72 hours; this is more an omission/interpretation than a direct contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: Friday hiking + Saturday gardening; uncertainty about when acquired; discovered earlier today due to local soreness; removed and brought tick in container; prior tick bite ~10 years ago with bullseye rash and antibiotics; prior tick more swollen; current tick less engorged.\nKey points missed: the doctor’s estimate that the tick may have been attached “longer than at least 72 hours” [D-6]; the explicit statement that the current tick was “pretty small” [P-4]; and the explicit comparison that she does NOT have the larger/bullseye rash now (only localized redness/tenderness) [P-6]. Also omitted the hiking location (Strathroy) noted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (hiking/gardening, uncertainty, sore/red/tender, container, prior bullseye rash and antibiotics, prior tick more swollen, current less swollen). The main potentially unverifiable element is the summarizing characterization of a “two-day period” of exposure, which is an inference and not explicitly stated, especially given the clinician’s later >72-hour concern. No major hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested timeline (Friday hiking → Saturday gardening → discovery/removal → presentation) and the comparison to the prior tick-bite episode (local symptoms and engorgement vs prior bullseye rash/antibiotics). No meaningful tangents."
