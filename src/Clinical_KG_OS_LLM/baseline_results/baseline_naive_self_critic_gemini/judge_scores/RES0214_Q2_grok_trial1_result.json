  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the patient 'does not report a current medication regimen' and 'no indication of any current medications,' contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [P-40] where she explicitly says she takes multivitamins only. The allergy to penicillin [P-37] and rash reaction [P-38] are correct, but the omission and misstatement of medications represent a significant factual error compared to the Gold Answer's accurate summary.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: multivitamins only [P-40] (missed), pre-diabetic monitoring but no prescription meds [P-33] (missed), no HTN [P-34]/cholesterol [P-35] (missed), penicillin allergy [P-37] (covered), rash [P-38] (covered), no trouble breathing [P-39] (missed). Covers allergy and reaction (~50% of key points), misses or errs on medication details.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about penicillin allergy and rash are verifiable [P-37, P-38]; however, 'no current medications' contradicts [P-40] (multivitamins stated); mentions irrelevant gallbladder [P-30]; hallucinates 'knowledge graph provided' and its support, which is not in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three question elements (meds, allergy, reaction) with headings; minor irrelevant mentions (gallbladder, knowledge graph) but focused overall."
