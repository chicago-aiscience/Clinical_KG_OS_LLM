  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the father's heart attack in his 50s, the patient's smoking habit, and the stress of her Masters thesis. It correctly identifies the patient's fear that her symptoms are cardiac in nature.",
    "completeness": "While the answer identifies the three main categories (family history, smoking, and stress), it omits several specific details found in the Gold Answer, including the grandfather's unknown cardiac history, specific cigarette counts (10 reduced to 5), the fact that she lives alone, her avoidance of running, and the recurrence of teenage anxiety attacks.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer refers to a 'knowledge graph' that was not provided in the source text. It also characterizes the smoking discussion at turn D-18 as being 'early' in the consultation, though it occurs past the midpoint of the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant and directly addresses how each factor contributes to and interacts with her concerns, providing a structured and logical explanation."
