  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the patient's father's history, her smoking status, and her academic stress. It correctly identifies the father's age (50s) and the timing of his heart attack (last year).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points present in the Gold Answer: the paternal grandfather's accidental death (unknown cardiac history), specific smoking statistics (starting at 18, 10 per day reduced to 5), the fact that the patient lives alone, her recent fear of running, and the specific mention of teenage anxiety attacks potentially returning. It covers the broad categories but lacks about 40-50% of the specific illustrative details.",
    "faithfulness": "While the patient-specific facts are grounded in the transcript, the response twice attributes information to a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source material. This is a hallucination of the source context.",
    "relevance": "The response is perfectly focused on the question, addressing each of the three factors (family history, smoking, stressors) and attempting to explain the interaction between them as requested."
