  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not provide information regarding whether symptoms worsened/fluctuated or if the patient had prior experience with these symptoms. In fact, the transcript explicitly states that the symptoms remained 'pretty consistent' (P-5, P-8) and that the patient had 'nothing like this' before (P-3).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover two of the three main components of the question: symptom progression/fluctuation and prior history. It only correctly addresses the timing and concurrency of the symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits 'negative hallucination' by asserting that information is missing from the source text when it is clearly present. This misrepresents the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer attempts to address all parts of the question but fails to provide the actual information requested due to errors in identifying the relevant dialogue in the transcript."
