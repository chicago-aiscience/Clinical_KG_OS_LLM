  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies **asthma** as the condition the doctor said would be added to the differential if the presentation were different, and correctly identifies **fever** as the key finding leading the doctor to favor infection rather than asthma in the current workup (consistent with [D-45]).\n\nMinor factual issue: it states the fever duration was “confirmed by the doctor as a duration of five days [D-3].” While [D-3] contains that statement, the parent corrects the timeline to ~3 days in [P-4], so presenting “five days” as confirmed/true is inaccurate relative to the overall transcript context.",
    "completeness": "Covers the main Gold Answer points:\n- Names asthma as the alternative diagnosis if presentation differed ✅\n- Specifies the conditional scenario (cough/SOB without fever) ✅\n- Identifies fever as the specific finding pushing away from asthma toward infection ✅\n\nMisses/does not include Gold Answer’s supportive nuance that wheeze/SOB were not clearly present and that asthma is not permanently ruled out (it’s deprioritized). These are supportive rather than core, but still part of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims are well grounded in [D-45] and fever is supported by [P-1]/[P-2].\n\nHowever, it introduces an arguably misleading claim about symptom duration being ‘confirmed’ as 5 days; the transcript contains a correction to ~3 days ([P-4]). This is a minor transcript-grounding issue but does not affect the main conclusion.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (which condition, and which clinical finding excluded it from the current workup) without substantive tangents."
