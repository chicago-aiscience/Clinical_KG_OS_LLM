  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: husband's prior illness suggesting household transmission for COVID prioritization [D-53], limited external exposures supporting this, and lack of flu shot elevating influenza risk [D-53, D-54]. No major contradictions, but minor discrepancies include unmentioned details like specific citations [P-17, P-22, P-23] and addition of extraneous 'Knowledge Graph' elements not in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: husband's week-long symptoms and doctor's prioritization of COVID [fully]; no flu shot and influenza as possibility [fully]; limited outside contact partially (mentions hiking [P-18] and household focus, but omits explicit work-from-home [P-23, P-42], self-isolation [P-22], no other sick contacts [P-17]). Covers ~85% of Gold's specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about husband, flu shot, doctor's statements, and hiking are verifiable [P-18, P-19, P-20, D-53, D-54, P-53]. However, 'Knowledge Graph Connections' are entirely fabricated/not in transcript; 'simultaneous onset' is inaccurate (husband's symptoms preceded); these introduce hallucination but core narrative is grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly and comprehensively addresses how the specified risk factors (husband's illness, household/limited contact, no flu shot) shape COVID vs. influenza differential, with structured analysis matching question focus; minor extras do not detract."
