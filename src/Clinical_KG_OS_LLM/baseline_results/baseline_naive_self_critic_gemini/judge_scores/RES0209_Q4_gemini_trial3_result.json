  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript lacks information regarding infectious screening and planned diagnostic tests. In reality, turns D-21 through D-29 explicitly cover screening for colds, infections, sick contacts, travel, loss of taste/smell, fevers, nausea, and the plan for a COVID swab. The answer is factually wrong about the content of the source text.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to identify any of the infectious symptoms screened (fevers, nausea, taste/smell loss, etc.), exposure history (travel, sick contacts), or the planned COVID-19 swab, instead providing irrelevant information about asthma triggers.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source because it asserts the absence of information that is clearly present. This is a hallucinated limitation of the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is not relevant to the specific question asked. Rather than answering the query about infectious screening, it provides an unsolicited summary of asthma triggers and then refuses to answer the core question based on a false premise."
