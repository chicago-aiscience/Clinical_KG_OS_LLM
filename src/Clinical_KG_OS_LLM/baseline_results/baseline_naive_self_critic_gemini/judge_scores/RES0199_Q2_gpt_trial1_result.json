  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol (acetaminophen) as the at-home medication and correctly links it to headache relief (supported by P-3/P-4). It also accurately reports the clinician’s supportive/OTC recommendations from D-52 (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches) and the isolation instruction. No statements contradict the Gold Answer; the only minor issue is an imprecise citation to P-1 for Tylenol use (P-1 mentions headache/cough but not Tylenol).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Tylenol used at home, (2) targeting headache, (3) supportive care—hydration, nutritious food, sleep, (4) Tylenol for fever, (5) Tylenol or NSAIDs for aches, (6) isolate 14 days. Missed from Gold Answer: (a) COVID swab testing as part of the plan (and results timing), (b) mention that no prescription medications were ordered, (c) patient’s self-initiated hydration effort before the visit. Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical recommendations and the at-home Tylenol use are grounded in the transcript (P-3/P-4, D-52). No added medications or measures beyond what is stated. Minor citation mismatch (P-1) does not introduce a new unsupported claim, but the specific Tylenol evidence is actually in P-3/P-4.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what was taken at home, what it targeted, and what additional medications/supportive measures were recommended. No meaningful irrelevant content."
