  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate but incomplete. It correctly identifies the three OTC medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and accurately quotes their ineffectiveness. However, it fails to mention the multivitamin as part of the patient's regular routine, which is explicitly asked for in the question and stated in P-25. This omission represents a significant gap in addressing the full scope of the question.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the required information. It addresses the pain-relief medications and their ineffectiveness but completely omits: (1) the multivitamin as part of regular routine [P-25], (2) confirmation of no other prescription medications [D-25, P-25], and (3) contextual information about stress management and smoking cessation attempts that provide fuller clinical picture. The question explicitly asks for both pain-treatment medications AND regular routine supplements.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The patient does mention trying those three medications in P-6, and the quote about effectiveness is accurate. There are no hallucinated facts or unsupported claims. The answer is grounded but incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the core question about OTC medications for chest pain and their effectiveness. However, it fails to address the second part of the question regarding regular routine supplements. The answer is partially relevant but incomplete in scope, missing approximately half of what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three OTC pain medications tried (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and correctly states their ineffectiveness, with proper citations. However, it significantly lacks completeness by omitting the multivitamin mentioned as part of the patient's regular routine, which was explicitly requested in the question. While completely faithful to the transcript with no hallucinations, the answer only addresses about half of the question's scope, resulting in a moderate overall score."
