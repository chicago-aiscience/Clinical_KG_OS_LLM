  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately lists the main clinical features (bullseye rash with correct current denial via D-6/P-6 though cites P-3 for past; joint pain D-7; fever/illness D-8; headaches D-19) matching Gold's core facts. Minor discrepancy: interprets P-1 soreness as distinct from joint pain (correct per P-7 'No'), but Gold explicitly notes denial. Diagnostics cover tick ID and serology perfectly; adds Lyme map (in transcript D-13, plausible but not in Gold as 'test'); misses physical exam and physician consult (in Gold). No major contradictions, core consistent.",
    "completeness": "Clinical: Covers bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/illness, headaches (4/6 key points; misses 'feeling well otherwise' D-18/P-18, no other bites P-9). Diagnostics: Covers tick lab (2/4; misses physical exam, physician consult; adds map not in Gold). Overall ~80% coverage of Gold's explicit points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: rash denial [D-6/P-6, P-3 past]; joint [D-7]; fever [D-8]; headaches [D-19]; tick/blood [D-18]; map [D-13]. Citations accurate to transcript. Minor issue: 'knowledge graph' not in provided source (possible hallucination, but content grounded). No fabricated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around exact question elements (clinical features absent + diagnostic tests proposed), with bullet points focused on transcript evidence; no tangents."
