  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the home medication for headache relief, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-3, P-4]; doctor's recommendations for Tylenol/NSAIDs and supportive measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, isolation) are factually accurate per [D-52]. Minor discrepancy: incorrect citation of [P-1] (which does not mention Tylenol) instead of [P-3]/[P-4]; omits patient's self-hydration and COVID swab but these are not core contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: patient's Tylenol for headache (100%); doctor's meds (Tylenol for fevers, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches) and supportive measures (hydration, nutritious food, sleeping well, isolation) (~90%). Misses patient's self-initiated hydration [P-30], explicit 'no prescription meds', and COVID swab order [D-52], covering 80-99% of Gold Answer points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript: Tylenol for headache [P-3/P-4], doctor's recommendations directly from [D-52]. Minor issue: [P-1] citation inaccurate (no Tylenol mentioned there), but claims remain grounded with no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by clearly separating patient's home medication/symptom and doctor's recommended medications/supportive measures, with no off-topic content."
