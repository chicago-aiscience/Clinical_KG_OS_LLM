  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript cuts off before any diagnostic proposals or rationale for a COVID swab, but the Gold Answer correctly identifies proposals for a chest X-ray [D-37, D-39] and COVID swab with protocol rationale [D-39]; this is a complete contradiction, as the relevant transcript sections are included and directly contradict the Generated Answer's assertion of absence.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: no medications [D-27,P-27], no medical history, chest X-ray proposed with explanation [D-37,D-39], COVID swab with specific rationale of institutional protocol for respiratory symptoms [D-39], discomfort note and reassurance [D-39], plan to arrange and discuss [D-40]; Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead incorrectly stating no proposals exist.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript 'cuts off prior to the doctor making any medical decisions,' but [D-37]-[D-42] explicitly include proposals for chest X-ray and COVID swab with rationale; early citations like [D-4],[P-2] are accurate but irrelevant to the false core claim.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer refuses to answer the question by falsely claiming insufficient transcript information, providing no details on proposed procedures or COVID swab rationale, thus failing to address the query directly."
