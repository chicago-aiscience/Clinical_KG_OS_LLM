  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the sputum description (yellow custard with red spots), the location of the chest pain (right side), and the systemic symptoms (fever and chills). However, it incorrectly attributes the 'raw' feeling to the chest pain area; the transcript [P-15] and Gold Answer clarify this refers to the throat. It also misses the 'dull' quality of the chest pain mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several symptoms reported in the consultation and included in the Gold Answer, such as the progression of the cough (raspy to severe), dyspnea (feeling winded on stairs), the sore throat itself, and the history of a runny nose. It covers the specific categories requested in the prompt but is less comprehensive than the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript, but there is a clear misattribution/hallucination regarding the 'raw' sensation. The transcript [P-15] states the throat feels raw after coughing, whereas the generated answer places this under the 'Chest Pain' quality section.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the specific prompts (sputum, chest pain, systemic symptoms). It does not include irrelevant information from the transcript."
