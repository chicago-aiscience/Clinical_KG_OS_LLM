  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the symptoms mentioned in the transcript. However, in the section identifying the 'earliest' symptoms, it only lists 'wheezy.' The transcript (P-2) and the Gold Answer both specify that 'wheezing' and 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' were noticed first by the mother.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer captures the main symptoms (wheezing, cough, shortness of breath). However, it misses several characterizing details included in the Gold Answer and the transcript, such as the cough being non-productive/without phlegm (P-31) and the absence of cyanosis/turning blue (P-32). It also omits the 'difficulty taking deep breaths' from the final summary of earliest symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the source text, providing correct citations for its claims. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the user's question, though with less detail than the Gold Answer."
