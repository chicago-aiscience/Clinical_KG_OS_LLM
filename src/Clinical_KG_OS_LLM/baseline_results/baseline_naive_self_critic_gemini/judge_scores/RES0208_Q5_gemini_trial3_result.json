  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error. It claims that the doctor did not explore travel or in-person client visits, whereas the transcript explicitly shows the doctor asking about travel outside the province [D-24] and recent client visits [D-32]. The patient's responses excluded these pathways, but the generated answer denies this occurred. It correctly identifies the grandson's cold as a connection to the infection assessment.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover the second half of the gold answer. It misses the specific details about travel being outside the province and the patient's occupation as a financial advisor who hadn't seen clients in two weeks. It only covers the grandson's visit key point, which is roughly 50% of the required information.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It incorrectly states there is no evidence of inquiry into non-familial exposures when the transcript clearly documents these inquiries. Additionally, it mentions a 'Knowledge Graph' (KG) which is not present in the provided source text, representing an outside-of-context hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure as it directly addresses both parts of the multi-part question, even though the information provided in the second part is factually incorrect."
