    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tums for reflux and the details regarding the change in the reflux regimen. However, it completely omits the medication Avodart (dutasteride) and the corresponding condition of an enlarged prostate (BPH), which were explicitly mentioned in the transcript [P-26] and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of the required information. It successfully explains the reflux medication, the change made, and the reasoning (dietary modification), but it misses one of the two current medications (Avodart) and its associated medical condition (enlarged prostate).",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript [P-27]. There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the components of the question, although it is less than comprehensive due to the omission of the second medication."
