    "correctness": "The Generated Answer includes only facts that are fully consistent with both the Gold Answer and the transcript: sudden shortness of breath upon waking [P-1], seizure the previous night and epilepsy [P-8], and temperature of 37.4 [P-5]. There are no factual errors, contradictions, or inaccuracies in what is stated.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: respiratory symptoms (sudden-onset SOB upon waking [P-1], ~3 hours prior [P-11], sudden dry cough no sputum [D-2,P-2,D-4,P-4]); neurological (seizure previous night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], felt fine after and went to bed [P-8]); fever (37.4°C that morning [P-5], mild [P-5], confirmed morning [D-6,P-6]). Covered: SOB [P-1], seizure and epilepsy [P-8], 37.4 [P-5]. Missed: entire cough symptom, SOB timing [P-11], dry/no sputum, fine after seizure [P-8], fever details (°C, mild, morning confirmation). Covers ~30-40% of key points (one of two respiratory symptoms, partial neuro and fever), significant gaps.",

    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the question, using bullet points to directly address respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and fever measurement with no irrelevant or off-topic content."
