  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms the doctor cited as evidence of a general infectious process in D-36: fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches. It also correctly identifies the additional symptoms the doctor used to justify that COVID-19 could not yet be ruled out: difficulty breathing/shortness of breath plus emerging sore throat and cough (all explicitly named in D-36). However, it introduces “loss of taste” as corroborating COVID-19 concern; while loss of taste is reported by the patient earlier (P-4), the Gold Answer correctly notes the doctor did not explicitly cite taste/smell in the D-36 assessment rationale. This addition makes the response slightly less accurate with respect to what the doctor cited in the assessment.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are covered: (1) infectious-process evidence = fevers, fatigue, muscle aches; (2) COVID-not-ruled-out symptoms = difficulty breathing + sore throat + cough. Key point missed: the Gold Answer’s explicit clarification that loss of taste/smell were elicited but not named by the doctor in the D-36 summary (and thus should not be counted as the doctor’s cited evidence for COVID concern).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript, especially the direct symptom list from D-36. The mention of a “knowledge graph” is not present in the transcript (unverifiable). The reference to loss of taste is transcript-supported as a patient symptom (P-4) but is not faithful to the question’s focus on what the doctor cited in the assessment summary (D-36). Overall, only minor ungrounded/extra framing rather than major fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response largely answers the question by separating (a) symptoms cited for general infection and (b) additional symptoms supporting ‘cannot rule out COVID.’ The added discussion of a “knowledge graph” and bringing in loss of taste (not part of the doctor’s cited D-36 assessment) are minor deviations from the exact ask."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer captures the doctor’s cited infection and COVID-concern symptoms from D-36, but it slightly weakens accuracy and alignment with the prompt by adding loss of taste and “knowledge graph” framing that were not part of the doctor’s assessment summary."
