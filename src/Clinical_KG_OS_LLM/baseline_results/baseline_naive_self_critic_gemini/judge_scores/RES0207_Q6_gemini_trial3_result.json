  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is entirely incorrect. It claims the transcript ends at turn [P-26] and that no next steps were discussed. However, the transcript provided clearly continues to turn [D-38], where the doctor explicitly outlines next steps, including consulting with another doctor and potentially ordering tests.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the consultation with another doctor, the return of the physician, or the mention of potential diagnostic tests.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the provided source. It hallucinates that the transcript is truncated or ends abruptly, despite the full text being available. It makes false claims about the content of the dialogue provided.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer fails to address the question because it incorrectly asserts that the information requested is not present in the text."
