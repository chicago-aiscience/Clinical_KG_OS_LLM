  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is incorrect regarding the patient’s current medications: the transcript states she “just take[s] multivitamins” [P-40], whereas the answer says she does not report any current medications. The penicillin allergy [P-37] and rash reaction [P-38] are correctly reported. Overall, a major error exists in one of the core asked elements (medication regimen).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points: (1) current regimen is multivitamins only; no prescription meds, (2) penicillin allergy, (3) rash as reaction, (4) no trouble breathing with reaction. Generated Answer includes (2) and (3), but misses/contradicts (1) and omits (4).",
    "faithfulness": "Statements about penicillin allergy and rash are grounded in the transcript. However, the claim that she reports no current medications contradicts [P-40]. The reference to a “knowledge graph provided” is not supported by the transcript and is an unverifiable addition.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to answer the exact question (medications, allergy, reaction) and does not substantially wander off-topic, aside from a brief unnecessary mention of a knowledge graph."
