  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes that the patient reported contact with his grandson who attends daycare and had a cold (supported by [P-23]) and that the doctor assessed an infectious process and could not rule out COVID (supported by [D-36]). However, it incorrectly claims the doctor did not explore other exposure pathways such as travel and in-person client visits. In the transcript, the doctor explicitly asked about travel outside the province ([D-24]) and about recent in-person client visits ([D-32]), both of which were denied/dated as not recent ([P-24], [P-32]). This directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer. It also introduces an extraneous \"Knowledge Graph\" assertion not present in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) grandson/daycare/cold exposure as a potential source; (2) doctor’s assessment of infection/can’t rule out COVID. Key points missed: (1) the doctor explored travel outside the province and the patient denied it; (2) the doctor explored occupational/in-person client visits and the patient reported last visit was a couple of weeks ago; (3) framing that with those pathways excluded, the grandson exposure remained the most identifiable source. Thus, it captures only a minority of the required exposure-history elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains multiple ungrounded or contradictory statements relative to the transcript: (1) the claim that travel and in-person client visits were not explored is disproven by [D-24] and [D-32]; (2) references to a \"Knowledge Graph\" and its risk-factor labeling are not in the source transcript. While some parts are grounded (grandson exposure; infectious assessment; cannot rule out COVID), the presence of these fabricated elements lowers faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (it attempts to link grandson exposure to infectious/COVID suspicion and discuss other exposure pathways), but it undermines relevance to the specific question by incorrectly stating that travel and client-visit exposures were not assessed, which is exactly what the question asks about."
