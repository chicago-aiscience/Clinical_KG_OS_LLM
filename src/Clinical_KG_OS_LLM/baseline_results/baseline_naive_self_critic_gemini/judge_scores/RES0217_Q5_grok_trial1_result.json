  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer's key facts: patient's hiking on Friday and gardening on Saturday [P-1] contributing to >72-hour attachment estimate [D-6], doctor's map reference deeming Strathroy concerning [D-13] justifying antibiotics [D-13]. Minor discrepancy: adds 'knowledge graph indicating Strathroy is a [RISK_FACTOR]' not in Gold or transcript, but no contradictions to core facts.",
    "completeness": "Covers: hiking Fri/gardening Sat [P-1], >72h estimate [D-6], Strathroy location [P-12], map assessment [D-13], antibiotics decision [D-13]. Missed from Gold: explicit uncertainty 'don't know when got it' [P-1], removal 'earlier today' [D-1], 'time since last outdoors' [D-2], 'along the creek' detail. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in transcript with accurate citations [P-1, D-6, P-12, D-13]. Minor hallucination: 'knowledge graph' and '[RISK_FACTOR]' not in transcript (doctor only references map). Rest verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question's two parts: (1) Fri/Sat activities to >72h duration, (2) Strathroy's map position justifying prophylaxis. Structured and focused, no off-topic content."
