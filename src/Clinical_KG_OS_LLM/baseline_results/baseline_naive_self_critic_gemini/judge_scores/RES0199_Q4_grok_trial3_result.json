  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out with correct quote from [D-52]. Specifies swab test and 24-48 hour turnaround with accurate quotes. Alternative diagnosis as viral illness with accurate partial quote. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Rule out COVID-19; 2) Swab test with 24-48 hr TAT; 3) Isolate 14 days; 4) Positive result - public health contact tracing; 5) Negative result - another viral illness; 6) Supportive management either way. Covered: 1,2,5 fully; paraphrases 5 accurately but shorter. Missed: 3,4,6 (supportive measures and positive result details, which are elaborations beyond strict question). Covers core question elements (condition, test/TAT, alt diagnosis) 100%, ~80% of Gold's detailed points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-52] transcript with precise citations and quotes (e.g., 'rule out as covid', 'take a swab', '24 to 48 hours', 'another viral illness'). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer uses bullet points directly mapping to question components (condition, test, TAT, alt diagnosis). Concise, focused, no tangents or off-topic content."
