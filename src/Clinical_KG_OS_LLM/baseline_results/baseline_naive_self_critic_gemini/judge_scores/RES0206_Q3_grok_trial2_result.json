  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are largely consistent with the Gold Answer: it correctly quotes the doctor's assessment [D-43], lists matching COPD exacerbation symptoms (increased cough frequency, sputum volume, dyspnea from [P-1]), and highlights green-yellow sputum and sinus pressure for infection. Minor discrepancies include attributing blood-tinged sputum explicitly to COPD support (present in transcript but not emphasized in Gold as supportive), omission of fever, headache, exercise tolerance decline, sick contact, past exacerbations triggered by illness, and exclusion of other triggers; no outright contradictions or errors in stated facts.",
    "completeness": "Covers doctor's dual assessment [D-43]; COPD key points: increased cough, sputum volume, dyspnea (3/4, misses decreased exercise tolerance [P-4]); infection key points: green-yellow sputum, sinus pressure (2/5, misses fever [P-9], headache [P-14], sick contact [P-20]); partial distinction via sputum but misses fever's role; entirely misses patient history pattern [P-3], excluded triggers [P-26, P-38], and note on no objective findings. Covers ~55-60% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom descriptions and citations ([P-1], [P-12], [D-43]) are directly verifiable in transcript. However, references to 'knowledge graph' linking symptoms to COPD are not present (hallucination); clinical interpretations like 'purulence (pus)' and 'typically indicative of bacterial component' for green-yellow sputum are plausible inferences but not explicitly stated in transcript (doctor notes infection generally [D-43], Gold calls it purulent). Minor unverifiable details overall.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around symptoms supporting dual assessment (COPD exacerbation and infection) and role of green-yellow sputum in distinguishing infectious trigger from non-infectious exacerbation, closely matching question; minor tangents include blood-tinged sputum and 'knowledge graph' mentions, but no significant off-topic content; neglects fever despite question specification."
