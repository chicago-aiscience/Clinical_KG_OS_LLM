  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tums for reflux and accurately describes the independent change to the previous reflux medication (stopped prescription med because figured out helpful foods, now manages with diet), which aligns with the Gold Answer and transcript [P-27]. However, it completely omits Avodart (dutasteride) for enlarged prostate (BPH), which is explicitly stated as a current medication in both the Gold Answer [P-25, P-26] and transcript [P-26]. This omission represents a significant factual error compared to the Gold Answer, as the question asks for all current medications and their conditions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Avodart (dutasteride) for enlarged prostate (BPH, not cancer) [P-25,P-26]; (2) Tums (OTC antacid) as-needed for reflux [P-27]; (3) previously on reflux medication but independently stopped it; (4) reason: figured out foods to manage symptoms via diet [P-27]; (5) doctor's positive response [D-28]; (6) no allergies [P-28]. Covered: (2), (3), (4). Missed entirely: (1), (5), (6). Covers approximately 50-60% of key points, primarily missing one full current medication.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer (Tums for reflux, stopped previous prescription med for reflux, reason related to identifying trigger foods and managing via diet) are directly verifiable in the transcript [P-27]. Citations are accurate. No hallucinations, fabrications, or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured and focused on listing current medications (albeit incompletely), their conditions, and detailing the reflux regimen change and reason, directly addressing all parts of the question with no irrelevant or off-topic content."
