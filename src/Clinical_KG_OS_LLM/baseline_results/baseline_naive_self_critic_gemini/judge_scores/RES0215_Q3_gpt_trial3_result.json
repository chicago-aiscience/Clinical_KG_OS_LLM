  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s diagnosis of asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction aligns with the Gold Answer’s conclusion (pediatric asthma/EIB in an atopic context). The supporting findings it cites (exercise trigger [P-3], cold worsening [P-38], improvement with rest [P-6], seasonal allergies [P-35]) are accurate and consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. No contradictory or clearly incorrect clinical claims were made.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) exercise-triggered symptoms ([P-3], pattern with activity [P-6]); (2) cold weather worsening ([P-38]); (3) episodic/reversible nature with rest ([P-6]); (4) seasonal allergies/atopic tendency ([P-35]).\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (a) symptoms occurring across multiple settings ([P-38]) and at home/backyard context ([P-40], [P-41]); (b) explicit spontaneous recovery citation ([P-33]) beyond rest; (c) nocturnal episode/trouble falling asleep ([P-43], [P-44]); (d) OTC antihistamine use supporting atopy ([P-36]); (e) pertinent negatives arguing against infection (no fever [P-7], no runny nose [P-8], no sick contacts [P-10], no phlegm [P-31]). Overall coverage is partial (roughly 60–75% of the Gold Answer’s supporting points).",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript (wheeze/SOB/cough [P-1], difficulty deep breaths [P-2], exertional trigger [P-3], cold worsening [P-38], rest improves [P-6], seasonal allergies [P-35]). It does not introduce unsupported exposures, test results, or treatments. Minor limitation: it does not explicitly cite the “across different settings” detail though it was part of the question framing; it also doesn’t claim it, so this is an omission rather than hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by (1) naming the most likely diagnosis (asthma/EIB) and (2) pointing to transcript findings that support it. It stays focused without irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly and faithfully identifies asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and supports it with several key transcript findings, but it omits multiple important supporting details included in the Gold Answer (multi-setting occurrence, nocturnal symptoms, atopy medication use, and infectious negatives)."
