  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all queried facts: (1) condition to rule out = COVID-19; (2) test ordered = a swab; (3) turnaround time = 24–48 hours; (4) alternative diagnosis if negative = another viral illness. No contradictions or incorrect statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "For the specific question asked, the Generated Answer includes all required elements (rule-out condition, test, turnaround time, alternative diagnosis). However, compared to the full Gold Answer, it omits additional points mentioned there (14-day isolation instruction, public health contact tracing if positive, and that management is supportive regardless).",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (particularly [D-52]) and it does not add unverifiable details. No hallucinations noted.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question (condition to rule out, test + turnaround time, and alternative diagnosis) with no irrelevant tangents."
