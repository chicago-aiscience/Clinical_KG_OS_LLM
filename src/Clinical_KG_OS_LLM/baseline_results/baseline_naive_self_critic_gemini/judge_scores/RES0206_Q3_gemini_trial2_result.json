  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the symptoms it lists (cough, sputum volume, dyspnea, and blood in sputum) and correctly identifies the clinical significance of green-yellow sputum as indicative of purulence or infection. However, it fails to address the specific question about how 'fever' helps distinguish the diagnoses, which was explicitly requested in the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it omits the decreased exercise tolerance [P-4], fever [P-9], mild headache [P-14], and sick contact [P-20]. Most importantly, it lacks the logic regarding the exclusion of other exacerbation triggers (denial of smoke/dust and medication adherence) and the patient's history of infection-triggered exacerbations [P-3]. It covers approximately 40% of the Gold Answer's detail.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the provided transcript. All symptom descriptions and the doctor's assessment quote are directly traceable to the source text without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and focused on the clinical query. However, it is slightly penalized for ignoring the 'fever' component of the 'how' question, although it remains entirely on-topic."
