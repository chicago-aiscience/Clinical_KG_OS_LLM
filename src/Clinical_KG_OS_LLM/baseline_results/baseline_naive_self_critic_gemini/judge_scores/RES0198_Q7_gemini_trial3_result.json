  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the progression of symptoms. It claims there is no evidence of which symptom appeared first, directly contradicting transcript segment P-3 where the patient states it was 'stuffy at first'. It also claims there was no change in predominance, contradicting the same segment where the patient says 'now it's mostly running'. Finally, it describes symptoms as intermittent, ignoring the clarification in P-8 that they were 'pretty constant'.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the one-week onset but misses the key points of the Gold Answer regarding the specific shift from congestion to rhinorrhea and the influence of decongestants. It only captures one side of the constant/intermittent description, failing to mention the clarification provided later in the dialogue.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source because it makes false claims about the absence of information. It states the transcript 'does not describe a change' and provides 'no specific evidence' for symptom order, both of which are present in P-3. This constitutes a negative hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question asked, attempting to address the chronological progression, the first symptom, and the frequency, even though the content of those answers is incorrect."
