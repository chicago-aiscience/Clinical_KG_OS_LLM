  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate in core details: timeline of hiking Friday and gardening Saturday [P-1], uncertainty of attachment [P-1], discovery due to soreness/redness/tenderness behind left knee [P-1], bringing tick in container [P-1], prior tick bite ~10 years ago with bullseye rash and antibiotics [P-3], prior tick quite swollen vs current small/not as engorged [P-3, P-4]. Minor discrepancies include imprecise location (says 'left leg' vs 'behind left knee in joint crease'), omission of patient's hope it was from hiking not garden, no mention of doctor's 72-hour estimate [D-6], and slight citation error (D-6 for prior symptoms which are primarily in P-3, though D-6 references them). No major errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: hiking Friday [P-1], gardening Saturday [P-1], uncertain attachment timing [P-1], discovery 'earlier today' implied via soreness behind knee/red/tender [P-1], removal and presentation with tick in container [P-1], prior ~10y bullseye/target rash/abx [P-3], prior swollen tick vs current small/little engorged/not as much [P-3,P-4], current localized symptoms sore/not joint [P-1,P-3]. Missed: explicit hope from hiking not garden [P-1], 'earlier today' discovery [P-1], 'stuck pretty good' [P-1], exact knee crease location [P-1], doctor's >72h estimate [D-6], doctor's non-engorged 'grape' confirmation [D-4], current no 'larger circle rash' [P-6]. Covers ~80% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1] for timeline/exposure/discovery, [P-3] for comparisons, [P-4] for tick size). Minor citation inclusion of [D-6] for prior rash/abx is verifiable as doctor references patient's history stated in P-3. No hallucinations or fabricated details; descriptions like 'stuck pretty good' and 'not too bad' match transcript. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly focused on question: structures timeline from Friday hiking through Saturday gardening to discovery/presentation, and directly compares current local symptoms (localized soreness/tenderness) and tick engorgement (small vs prior swollen) to prior episode (bullseye rash/abx). No irrelevant content or tangents."
