  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly accurate, but it contains a minor error in citation/fact mapping: it states that the duration of the cough is confirmed in [P-5], but [P-5] only confirms that the cough is dry. The duration is confirmed in [P-4]. Otherwise, the facts about timing (4-5 days vs. a couple of days) are correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a key point from the Gold Answer and transcript regarding the comparison to prior experiences. Specifically, it fails to mention the patient's statement in [P-24] that he has never had a dry cough like this before and that while he has had runny noses in the past, they never lasted this long. Instead, it focuses on the absence of asthma symptoms, which is less directly related to 'similar symptoms' (cough/runny nose) mentioned in the prompt. It also omits the detail that the cough has 'stayed the same' in severity [P-7].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is faithful to the transcript, though the interpretation of [P-5] is slightly off regarding what was being confirmed. The clinical details provided are grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question, providing a clear sequence and timing. It includes some extra negative symptoms (sore throat, nausea, etc.) which were not explicitly requested but are relevant to clinical symptom development. However, the comparison section is slightly less relevant as it focuses on asthma (which the patient denies having) rather than the previous occurrences of the symptoms at hand (runny nose)."
