  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by claiming that eczema, allergic reactions/EpiPen use, and night sweats were 'not explicitly screened for or discussed in the provided text segments.' In reality, the transcript contains direct questions for night sweats [D-9], allergic reactions/EpiPen [D-18, D-21], and eczema [D-32, D-33]. It also incorrectly states Jessica did not answer the asthma question, whereas she explicitly replied 'No' in [P-29].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It only discusses asthma and recent illness exposure, completely omitting the doctor's screening for productive cough (phlegm), GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), joint pain, and skin changes/rashes. It fails to provide the specific responses Jessica gave for the majority of the conditions listed in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits a significant lack of faithfulness by hallucinating the absence of information that is clearly present in the source transcript. While the sections on asthma and allergies are somewhat grounded, the blanket dismissal of the other symptoms requested by the prompt is an evidence-based failure.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. While it attempts to answer the question, it spends significant space justifying why it cannot answer the specific parts of the prompt regarding eczema, EpiPens, and night sweats based on a false premise that they were not in the text, thereby failing to address the user's request effectively."
