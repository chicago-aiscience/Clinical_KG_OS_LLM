  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major components from [D-43]: physical exam with vital signs and chest auscultation, COVID swab, labs, attending consultation, and disposition criteria based on vitals/labs. It correctly identifies the preliminary diagnosis of COPD exacerbation likely from infection. The Gold Answer provides additional context (temperature check from [D-11]/[P-10], patient agreement from [P-43]) but these are supportive details rather than core plan elements. No factual errors are present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all essential plan components: examinations (physical exam, vitals, chest auscultation), tests (COVID swab, labs), consultations (attending physician), and disposition criteria (vitals and labs results). It includes the preliminary clinical impression of COPD exacerbation from infection. The Gold Answer adds contextual elements like the temperature check rationale and patient agreement, but the Generated Answer captures approximately 90% of the key substantive points from the plan itself.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-43] of the transcript. The physical exam, vital signs check, chest auscultation, COVID swab, labs, attending consultation, and disposition criteria based on vitals/labs are explicitly stated. The COPD exacerbation diagnosis from infection is accurately quoted. No fabricated content or hallucinations are present. The answer stays grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about the doctor's plan including examinations, tests, consultations, and admission/discharge criteria. All content is focused on answering the specific question asked. The structured format with bullet points enhances clarity and relevance by organizing the plan components as requested."
