  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect and directly contradicts the provided transcript. It claims the conversation ends at turn [P-26], whereas the transcript continues until [D-38]. Consequently, it incorrectly states that no next steps were communicated, while the Gold Answer (and transcript turn [D-37]) explicitly details them.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the mention of the other doctor's involvement, the possibility of tests, and the plan to return shortly to discuss progress.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits significant hallucination regarding the structure of the provided text. It asserts that turns [D-27] through [D-38] are missing, even though they are present in the source transcript provided to the evaluator.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question because it incorrectly claims the information required to answer it is missing from the text."
