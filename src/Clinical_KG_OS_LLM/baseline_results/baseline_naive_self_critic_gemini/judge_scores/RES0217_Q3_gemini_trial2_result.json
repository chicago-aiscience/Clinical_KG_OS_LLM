  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer regarding the key details: exposure on Friday/Saturday, attachment duration over 72 hours, the Strathroy location, and the 10-year prior history of a tick bite with bullseye rash.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the four main categories requested in the prompt. However, it misses a specific point mentioned in the Gold Answer: the patient's awareness that all ticks in the area are now considered potential carriers, which influenced the decision despite the tick's appearance. It also omits the doctor's plan to send the tick to the lab for species identification.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The term 'known susceptibility' used to describe the prior history is a slight interpretive stretch compared to the transcript, but remains grounded in the patient's medical history.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question with a clear structure."
