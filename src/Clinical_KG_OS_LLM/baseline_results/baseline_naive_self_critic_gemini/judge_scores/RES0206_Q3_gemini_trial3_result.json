  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript regarding the symptoms it does include (cough, sputum, dyspnea, sinus pressure). It correctly identifies the doctor's assessment in [D-43].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the patient's reported fever (which was explicitly requested in the prompt), the headache, the sick contact, the decreased exercise tolerance (walking the dog), and the exclusion of other triggers (dust/smoke). It covers about 50-60% of the relevant clinical details provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The symptoms listed are directly found in the patient's statements ([P-1], [P-12]). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant as it addresses the dual assessment and the significance of sputum. However, it fails to address the specific part of the prompt asking how 'fever' helps distinguish between the diagnoses, which reduces its score in this category."
