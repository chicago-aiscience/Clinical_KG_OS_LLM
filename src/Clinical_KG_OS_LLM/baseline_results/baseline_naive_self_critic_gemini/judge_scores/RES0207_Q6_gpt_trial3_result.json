  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states that in D-37 the clinician said they would review the information with the doctor working that day, then return shortly to discuss next steps, including whether tests are needed and how to move forward. The Generated Answer incorrectly claims no next steps were communicated and that the transcript ends earlier (around P-26) without any plan. This directly contradicts the explicit content of D-37 and D-38, so the response is factually incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer: (1) information will be reviewed with the doctor working today; (2) another physician involved in decision-making; (3) clinician will come back shortly; (4) discuss next steps including possible tests and plan to move forward; (5) no specific tests named yet; (6) polite closing. The Generated Answer covers none of these and instead denies they occurred. Completeness is therefore near zero.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer states the conversation ends abruptly while the patient is speaking and that there are no later doctor turns (e.g., D-27/D-30) in the provided text. This is not grounded in the provided transcript, which clearly includes D-37 and D-38 with the plan. Thus, it contains multiple claims that conflict with the transcript and is not faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to address the question about next steps and follow-up actions, but it does so by asserting there were none. While on-topic, it fails to provide the requested details and contradicts the transcript, so relevance is only partial."
