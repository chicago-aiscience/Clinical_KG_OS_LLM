  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the timeline of events from Friday hiking through Saturday gardening to tick discovery and doctor presentation. It correctly identifies the patient's comparison between current and prior tick bites, including the bullseye rash and antibiotic treatment from 10 years ago. The engorgement comparison is accurate (current tick 'pretty small' vs. prior 'quite swollen'). All factual claims align with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all major elements requested: (1) complete timeline from Friday hiking through Saturday gardening to discovery and presentation, (2) uncertainty about when tick attached, (3) comparison of local symptoms between episodes, (4) comparison of tick engorgement, (5) prior bullseye rash, and (6) prior antibiotic treatment. However, it misses some specific details present in the Gold Answer, such as the doctor's 72-hour estimation, the plastic container detail in context of discovery, and the specific description of current symptoms lacking the 'larger circle rash'. The answer covers approximately 85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The timeline details, symptom descriptions, and comparisons are all grounded in patient statements [P-1], [P-3], [P-4], [P-6]. The citations are accurate and appropriate. No hallucinated information is present. The answer appropriately uses direct quotes and paraphrases from the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question's two main components: (1) the timeline of tick exposure and (2) the comparison between current and prior episodes. It maintains focus throughout without introducing irrelevant information. The structure clearly delineates the timeline section from the comparison section, making it easy to follow and directly responsive to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and faithful account of the tick exposure timeline and symptom comparison, correctly capturing all major factual details from the transcript. It scores highly on correctness, faithfulness, and relevance. Completeness is slightly lower (4/5) as it omits some specific details present in the Gold Answer, such as the 72-hour attachment estimation and certain descriptive elements. Overall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the clinical question with accurate, grounded information."
