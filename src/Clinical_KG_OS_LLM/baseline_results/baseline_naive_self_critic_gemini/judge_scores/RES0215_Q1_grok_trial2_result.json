  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the main respiratory symptoms from [P-1] (wheezy, short of breath, slight cough) and [P-3] (out of breath with activity), and includes difficulty taking deep breaths from [P-2] under wheezy and short of breath. However, it inaccurately identifies only 'wheezy' as the earliest symptom based on [P-1]'s duration phrasing, whereas the Gold Answer correctly cites [P-2] specifying both wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths as first noticed. It also does not note the cough as more recent ('and now' in [P-1]) as precisely as Gold, and misses nuances like non-productive cough [P-31] and no cyanosis [P-32]. Core facts are mostly correct, but there are some factual discrepancies on the precise earliest symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: wheezy [P-1,P-2], short of breath [P-1], cough [P-1], out of breath with activity [P-3], difficulty deep breaths [P-2]. Missed: hard time catching breath without cyanosis [P-32], cough recent implication and non-productive [P-1,P-31], child looks fine otherwise [P-9]. Covers main symptoms at presentation (~80%) but partial on earliest (only one of two) and misses descriptive details.",
    "faithfulness": "All listed symptoms and citations ([P-1], [P-2], [P-3]) are directly verifiable in the transcript. Reasoning for earliest is plausible from [P-1] but overlooks [P-2]; no fabrications or hallucinations. Minor issue: refers to mother as 'patient' inaccurately (P is parent), but claims remain grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around symptoms at presentation (bulleted list) and earliest symptoms (dedicated section), perfectly matching the two-part question with no off-topic content."
