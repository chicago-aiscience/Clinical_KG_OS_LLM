  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states it is not possible to describe the evolution from diagnosis at age eight or baseline bronchodilator use; the transcript explicitly contains both (diagnosed at 8; baseline use about once every two weeks; current use almost daily 5–6x/week). It correctly summarizes several current symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheeze) and some triggers (exercise/cold, possible spring/pollen). However, it omits/does not correctly report key quantitative medication-use changes and mis-cites chest tightness as [D-20] (it is [P-20]).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points covered: current exacerbation symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheeze), triggers (exercise/cold; spring/pollen) partially. Key points missed: (1) explicit timeline from diagnosis at 8 to current age 10, (2) baseline bronchodilator frequency “once every two weeks,” (3) current bronchodilator frequency “almost everyday… five six times a week,” (4) clarification that symptoms began ~2 weeks (initially said ~1 week), (5) wheezing occurs more often than bronchodilator use (only uses when very hard to breathe), (6) nighttime symptoms every other day/every two days, (7) denial of infectious precipitant. Overall it covers <50% of the Gold Answer’s required evolution-focused content.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded in the transcript (current dry cough, SOB, wheeze; cold/exercise triggers; possible spring/pollen). However, the claim that historical/baseline evolution cannot be answered is contradicted by the transcript (so not faithful to the provided source). The mention of a “knowledge graph” is not part of the transcript. There is also a citation mismatch for chest tightness.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically for how symptoms and bronchodilator use evolved over time across three phases (diagnosis at 8 → baseline once/2 weeks → current 2-week exacerbation with near-daily 5–6x/week use). The Generated Answer largely avoids addressing the longitudinal evolution (claiming it cannot be done) and focuses mainly on current symptoms, so it only partially addresses the asked comparison."
