  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the mother's suspicion of school as the source [P-1, P-2], no school notification [P-39], and lack of known specific sick contacts at school [P-38]. Minor discrepancies include overstating the younger sister as a 'potential contact' (sister reported healthy [P-36], isolation precautionary [D-44]) and not quoting the precise denial of outside contacts ('we know for sure not outside' [P-38]). Core facts align with Gold, no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers: school as suspected source [P-1,P-2], no known sick at school [P-38], no notification [P-39]. Misses or undercovers: exact 'we know for sure not outside school' [P-38], 'kinda hard to say' nuance for school [P-38], school COVID test requirement for return to notify exposures [P-41], no travel [P-40], no environmental exposures [P-37]. Approximately 60-70% key points covered.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: school suspicion [P-1,P-2], no specific school sick contacts [P-38,P-39], no notification [P-39], sister isolation rec [D-44] (though not a reported sick contact). Doctor's swab rec grounded [D-44]. No hallucinations; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses school role in suspicion, sick contacts at/ outside school (no known), and lack of school notification. Summary bullets perfectly match question elements; minor extras (sister, swab) are contextually tied."
