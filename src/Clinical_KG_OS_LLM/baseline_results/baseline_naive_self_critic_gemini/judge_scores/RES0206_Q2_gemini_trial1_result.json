  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly claims that the patient's hypertension and inhaler frequency are not documented in the transcript. However, the transcript explicitly mentions the daily and bi-weekly frequency of the inhalers (P-26), the hypertension diagnosis (P-22), and the decision to use lifestyle modifications (weight loss and walking) instead of medication (P-23, P-24).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses nearly all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the frequency of inhaler use, the specific management of hypertension, and the reasons for avoiding antihypertensive medication, all of which are in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer demonstrates a failure to process the full transcript provided. It claims information is missing based on a limited segment (turns D-4 through P-12), ignoring the later parts of the conversation (P-22 through P-26) where the answers are located.",
    "relevance": "The answer fails to address the specific components of the question, providing a 'not documented' response for most queries despite the information being present."
