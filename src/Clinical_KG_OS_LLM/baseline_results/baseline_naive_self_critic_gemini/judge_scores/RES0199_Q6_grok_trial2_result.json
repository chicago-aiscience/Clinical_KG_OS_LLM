  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. All stated facts match exactly (e.g., COVID-19 swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, supportive care details including hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever if develops, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). No errors, contradictions, or fabrications; omissions do not introduce inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: diagnostic test (swab + 24-48 hr results timing - misses timing); 14-day isolation (covered); contact tracing if positive (covered); alternative diagnosis if negative (missed); supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep well, Tylenol for fevers if any, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches - fully covered); no Rx meds beyond supportive (missed explicit statement). Covers ~85% of key points (core elements present, minor details like timing and alt dx omitted).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations. No hallucinations; phrasing like 'well hydrated, eating nutritious food, resting/sleeping well' and 'antipyretics like Tylenol if fever develops; Tylenol or NSAIDs (anseads)' precisely matches transcript. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question's specified elements (diagnostic test, self-isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), using headings that mirror the query. No off-topic content."
