{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies chronic cough for 10 years [P-3], COPD diagnosis initially 'couple years ago' [P-1] but clarified to 'almost, probably five years ago' [P-2]; Generated Answer correctly identifies 10-year cough but inaccurately states COPD as 'a couple years ago' [P-1] without noting the five-year clarification, representing a minor factual discrepancy while core timeline elements (worsening cough/sputum last week, acute SOB last few days) match perfectly.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 10y cough (covered), ~5y COPD dx with clarification (partially covered, misses 5y detail), intermittent baseline SOB (covered indirectly), 1 week cough worse/sputum yellow (covered), last few days SOB/chills (SOB covered, chills missed); covers ~85-90% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All timeline claims directly verifiable in transcript (e.g., [P-3] 10y cough, [P-1/P-5] week cough, [P-6] sputum, [P-8] SOB days); minor citation inaccuracy ([P-3] for worsening cough, which is actually chronic); 'knowledge graph' mention unverifiable as none provided, but content grounded; physician dx [D-52] accurate.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the question's timeline elements (cough onset, COPD dx, worsening cough/sputum, acute SOB), with clear sections matching query precisely; minor extras (summary, physician note) highly pertinent."
