  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the patient tried edibles as a medication/treatment pre-visit [P-34], but the transcript clearly shows the patient reported 'No, I haven't tried anything' specifically for symptoms [P-9] and takes no medications [P-24]; this is a significant factual error contradicting the Gold Answer. Doctor's recommendations on COVID test and self-isolation are mostly accurate but omit details like results timeline, potential other tests, and consulting the supervising doctor.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: COVID swab test [D-39], self-isolation instructions [D-39]. Missed: explicit 'no treatments tried' [D-9/P-9, D-24/P-24], results take 1-2 days, potential other tests and consult with supervising doctor [D-40]. Includes irrelevant edibles. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Edibles claim verifiable in transcript [P-34] but hallucinated as a 'medication/treatment tried' for symptoms when context is substance use history, not symptom relief; ignores direct denial of trying anything for symptoms [P-9]. Doctor claims accurately grounded with citations [D-39]. Multiple misinterpretations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structured to answer patient pre-visit attempts and doctor recommendations/instructions, but includes off-topic/irrelevant edibles as 'treatments tried', diluting focus on symptom-related content."
