{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains two significant factual errors. First, it claims the pain does not resolve on its own, contradicting the patient's statement that it 'goes away' when talking to people at school [P-9]. Second, it incorrectly attributes the patient's comments about anxiety attacks [P-20] to the chest pain, when the transcript clearly shows the patient was discussing heart fluttering/palpitations. However, the descriptions of quality, duration, and occurrence are mostly accurate.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the specific 'situations' where the pain resolves (socializing, hands-on tasks, being at school), which was a specific requirement of the prompt. It also omits the fact that there was no preceding injury and no prior history of this pain, points included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the pain correlates with anxiety attacks is a misinterpretation of the transcript [P-20 refers to flutters]. The statement that the pain requires intervention to resolve is also unfaithful to the text, as the patient explicitly mentions it goes away during distraction or social interaction.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is well-structured and addresses the categories requested in the prompt, though it fails to provide the correct content for the 'resolution' section."
