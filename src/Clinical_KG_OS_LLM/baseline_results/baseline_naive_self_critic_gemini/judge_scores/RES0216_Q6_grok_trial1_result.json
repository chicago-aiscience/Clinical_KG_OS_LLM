  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment of asthma as the top differential (though slightly more definitive than Gold's 'top of the differential pending findings'), correctly notes cardiac ischemia as lower due to symptom profile per D-36, and matches the plan components closely; minor discrepancy in implying 'no shortness of breath during exercise' when patient reported dyspnea but doctor downplayed it as non-cardiac.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: asthma top differential [D-35], phys exam (lungs) [D-35], rescue puffers trial [D-35], contingency if no improvement [D-35/36]; missed or partially covered: explicit 'pending exam/findings', patient lacks rescue puffers [P-17/18], consult with supervising doc [D-35/37], 'further investigations depending on findings', and stepwise 'one thing at a time' [D-36]; covers ~85-90%.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., D-35 for assessment/plan, D-36 for cardiac); no fabrications, minor paraphrase of doctor's interpretation of SOB is grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly and comprehensively addresses the question's elements (assessment, phys exam, first intervention, contingency) with focused structure and no off-topic content."
