  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to be ruled out, the 'swab' as the test, the 48-hour turnaround time, and the isolation instruction. These facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the Gold Answer: specifically, the instruction to 'not see anyone else' (which was paired with isolation) and the detail that the patient would receive 'further instructions from public health' once results returned.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript [D-39]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses each part of the multi-part question without including unnecessary information."
