  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the timeline (approx. 5 days vs. Gold's 4-5 days), initial trigger (playing tag [P-3]), wheezing as initial symptom, fluctuating episodic pattern with resolution on rest and recurrence with activity [P-6], emergence of cough [P-1], and single nocturnal wheeziness with sleep trouble [P-43,P-44]. Minor discrepancies include implying cough developed 'alongside' rather than more recently after wheezing/SOB, omitting difficulty with deep breaths [P-2], and adding colder weather as a trigger [P-38] not emphasized in Gold as initial. Core facts consistent, no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers: onset 4-5 days [P-1], initial trigger activity/tag [P-3], wheezing/SOB, fluctuating episodes resolving spontaneously/with rest and recurring with activity [P-5,P-6], cough emergence [P-1], nocturnal episode [P-43,P-44]. Misses: precise 'difficulty taking deep breaths' [P-2] as earliest symptom, cough non-productive/no phlegm [P-31], pertinent negatives (no cyanosis [P-32], no fever [P-7], fine otherwise [P-9]). Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: timeline [P-1], trigger [P-3], symptoms [P-1,P-2,P-6], cough [P-1], fluctuating [P-5,P-6], nocturnal [P-43,P-44]. Colder weather verifiable [P-38,P-39] but not hallucinated. However, repeated references to 'clinical knowledge graph' supporting coexistence of symptoms/sleep disturbances are entirely fabricated/not in transcript, introducing multiple hallucinated elements presented as authoritative.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around question elements (onset/trigger, cough emergence, fluctuating pattern, nocturnal episode); minor addition of weather trigger is pertinent to symptom development; no off-topic content."
