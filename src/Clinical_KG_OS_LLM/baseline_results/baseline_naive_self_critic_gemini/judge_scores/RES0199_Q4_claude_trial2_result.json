  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer. All key facts are correctly identified: COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, swab as the diagnostic test, 24-48 hours as turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. The citations [D-52] are accurate and match the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all essential elements from the Gold Answer: the primary condition (COVID-19), the diagnostic test (swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours), and alternative diagnosis (viral illness). However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the 14-day isolation instruction, public health contact tracing for positive results, and the supportive management approach. These are supplementary details rather than core answers to the specific questions asked.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The answer is well-grounded with accurate citations. No hallucinated information is present. The quotes and references are precise and can be traced back to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly focused and directly addresses all components of the multi-part question. It systematically answers each sub-question (condition to rule out, diagnostic test, turnaround time, alternative diagnosis) without including irrelevant information. The structured bullet-point format enhances clarity and relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-cited, and highly relevant response to the clinical question. It correctly identifies all key elements: COVID-19 as the primary diagnostic concern, swab testing with 24-48 hour turnaround, and viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. While it omits some contextual details about isolation protocols and management that appear in the Gold Answer, these are supplementary rather than essential to answering the specific questions posed. The answer demonstrates strong faithfulness to the source transcript with accurate citations and no hallucinations."
