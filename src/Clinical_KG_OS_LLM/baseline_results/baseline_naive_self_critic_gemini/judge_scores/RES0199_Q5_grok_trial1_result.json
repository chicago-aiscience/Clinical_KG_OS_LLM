  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer accurately details the doctor's systematic exploration of living situation (D-45/P-45, D-46/P-46), sick contacts (D-47/P-47), workplace (D-48/P-48, D-50/P-50), and travel (D-49/P-49), all directly supported by the transcript. The Generated Answer falsely claims 'no evidence' of such questioning and that the doctor 'did not systematically explore' these sources, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript on every key fact. This is a complete factual reversal.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: confirmation after P-38; living (apartment alone, environmental triggers); sick contacts (D-47/P-47); workplace (car dealership, sick coworkers); travel (denied); substance use screening; no clear source. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead asserting the opposite (no exploration) and focusing on symptoms/COVID management.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of explicit questions in the transcript (e.g., claims no questioning on living, work, travel, contacts), despite verbatim evidence (D-45 to D-50). All major claims about lack of inquiry are unverifiable and contradicted by transcript; substance use screening is omitted entirely.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by claiming no sources were explored, with focused content on the transcript's alleged gaps and COVID focus, no off-topic tangents."
