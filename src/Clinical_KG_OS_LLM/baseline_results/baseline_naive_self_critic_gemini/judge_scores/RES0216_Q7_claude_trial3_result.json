  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. Most critically, it incorrectly states the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine' when the Gold Answer clearly indicates the patient reduced from a couple of walks per day to typically just one walk daily [P-22]. It also mischaracterizes symptom progression as 'persistent but intermittent' when the Gold Answer states symptoms are 'kind of always there' at baseline and exacerbated by activities. The Generated Answer correctly identifies when symptoms started (three days ago) and that they first appeared during a walk [P-4], and correctly identifies exacerbating factors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly addresses: (1) onset three days ago, (2) first noticed during a walk, (3) constant baseline presence, (4) exacerbating factors (walking, standing from chair, deep breaths). However, it misses or misrepresents critical information: (1) symptom progression 'staying the same/steady' (says 'intermittent' instead), (2) that nothing particular triggered onset ('just kind of came on'), (3) most importantly, the functional impact - reduction from couple of walks to one walk daily, (4) no missed work time, (5) agreement that symptoms are noticeable but not dramatically impairing.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination in stating the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine.' This directly contradicts P-22 where the patient explicitly states 'the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually.' Additionally, it references '[KG]' (Knowledge graph data) which does not appear in the source transcript, suggesting fabricated citation. Most other claims are verifiable in the transcript, but these two issues represent meaningful hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's components about development over three days, activity when symptoms first appeared, progression, exacerbating factors, and impact on walking routine. However, the final section on 'Impact on Daily Routine' provides incorrect information that contradicts the question's intent. The structure follows the question well with organized sections, but the content error in the most critical section (impact on daily routine) significantly undermines relevance to what was actually asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates partial accuracy in describing the patient's chest tightness onset and exacerbating factors but contains critical errors. It correctly identifies the three-day timeline, initial presentation during walking, and specific triggers (walking, standing, deep breathing). However, it significantly misrepresents the functional impact by stating the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine' when the transcript clearly shows reduction from multiple to one daily walk [P-22]. It also mischaracterizes symptom progression as 'intermittent' rather than 'staying the same' and includes a fabricated citation to '[KG]'. The answer covers about 60-70% of key points but the factual errors regarding the most important aspect—impact on daily activities—substantially diminish its clinical utility."
