  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnostic test (COVID-19 swab) and the primary rationale (the husband's similar symptoms and household transmission). However, it attributes logic to a 'knowledge graph' which does not exist in the source transcript or the provided context.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the key points: the test type and the rationale involving the husband's symptoms. It misses the specific detail from the Gold Answer regarding the sequence of the conversation (that influenza was only prioritized lower after confirming the patient's flu shot status).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer suffers from hallucinations by twice referencing a 'knowledge graph' that is not present in the source transcript. While the clinical facts (fever, sore throat, husband's illness) are in the text, the attribution to an external knowledge graph is ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the test ordered and the doctor's rationale."
