  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies decongestants as the medication tried, accurately captures the patient's 'worked a little bit' assessment, and properly identifies Tylenol Cold as the recommended OTC treatment. All core facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main components requested: prior medication, effectiveness assessment, and doctor's recommendation. However, it omits several contextual details present in the Gold Answer: the patient's reasoning about why they thought it worked ('nose is runny now'), the doctor's explanation about supportive care including hydration, the timeframe for symptom resolution ('a few weeks'), and the acknowledgment that little can be done for viral infections beyond supportive care. These omissions represent approximately 40% of the key contextual information.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. P-10 correctly references the decongestant discussion and effectiveness assessment. D-39 accurately references the Tylenol Cold recommendation. No hallucinated information is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question without deviation. It is focused and concise, providing exactly what was asked without irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually correct, fully faithful to the transcript, and highly relevant to the question. It accurately identifies the decongestant previously tried, the patient's assessment of 'worked a little bit,' and the Tylenol Cold recommendation. However, it lacks important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including the patient's reasoning about effectiveness, supportive care recommendations (hydration), expected symptom duration, and the doctor's explanation about viral infection management. This results in good but incomplete coverage of the clinical information."
