  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the home medication for headache relief, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-3, P-4]. Doctor's recommendations for Tylenol/NSAIDs, hydration, nutrition, sleep, and isolation align with Gold and [D-52]. Minor discrepancies: incorrect citation [P-1] (Tylenol not mentioned there), omits patient's self-hydration [P-30] and COVID swab test from Gold Answer. Core facts accurate.",
    "completeness": "Covers: patient Tylenol for headache; doctor's Tylenol for fevers, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches, hydration, nutritious food, sleep, isolation. Misses: patient's self-initiated hydration efforts [P-30], explicit COVID swab test, note on no prescriptions. Covers ~85-90% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: Tylenol for headache verifiable [P-3,P-4]; recommendations directly from [D-52]. Minor issue: cites [P-1] inaccurately for Tylenol (symptoms only). No hallucinations, citations mostly accurate.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to question: patient's home medication/symptom, then doctor's meds and supportive measures. No irrelevant content, perfectly focused."
