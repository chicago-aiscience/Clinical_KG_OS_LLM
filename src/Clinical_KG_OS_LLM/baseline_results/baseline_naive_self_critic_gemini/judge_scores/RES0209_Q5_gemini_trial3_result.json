  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three triggers (exercise, cold air, and pollen) and the family history (sister with asthma). However, it makes a distinction that pollen is an allergy trigger 'rather than' an asthma trigger, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer treat them as triggers for the patient's asthma symptoms (allergic asthma). It also mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is not present in the provided source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer: the specific frequency of rescue inhaler use (from once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week), the fact that no other family members have allergies, and the doctor's concluding suggestion regarding a change in medication for better control.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer repeatedly cites a 'knowledge graph [KG]' as a source for its claims. This 'KG' is not part of the provided transcript or source material, representing a hallucination of source attribution. However, the patient's specific symptoms and history are correctly attributed to the transcript [P-xx].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, structured to directly address each component of the multi-part question (triggers, family history, and the suspicion of allergies)."
