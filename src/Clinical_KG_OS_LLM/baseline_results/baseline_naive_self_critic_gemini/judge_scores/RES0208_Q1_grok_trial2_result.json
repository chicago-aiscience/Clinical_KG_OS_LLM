  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is mostly factually accurate compared to the Gold Answer, correctly identifying loss of taste, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, fever, weakness, decreased appetite, and headaches with appropriate citations. Minor discrepancies include categorizing headaches under musculoskeletal (Gold has constitutional), placing weakness under constitutional (Gold has musculoskeletal), including 'laborious breathing' which is part of the chief complaint shortness of breath to be excluded, and less precise descriptions of cough and sore throat without noting they are early/mild/dry/'on its way.' No major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: loss of taste [P-4], sore throat [P-9], cough [P-7/8 partial], overall achy/muscle aches [P-20/21 partial], general weakness [P-2], subjective fever [P-4], decreased appetite [P-2/4/18], mild headaches [P-11-13]. Missed: diminished sense of smell [P-6] and its newness [P-5], explicit denial of runny nose/congestion [P-10], detailed qualifiers for cough (early dry, 'on its way', minimal coughing), sore throat (mild, just starting), muscle aches (generalized, not one spot). Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with citations provided (e.g., loss of taste [P-4], weakness [P-2], fever [P-4], appetite [P-2/4], headaches [P-11/12], cough/sore throat/muscle aches referenced via patient reports and confirmed in D-36 summary). No hallucinations; even doctor summaries in D-36 accurately reflect prior patient statements (e.g., P-7/8/9/20). Minor issue: relies partly on D-36 instead of direct patient citations, but all grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by listing symptoms beyond chief complaints, structured precisely by the requested categories (sensory, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional), with no off-topic content beyond minor inclusion of breathing description under upper respiratory."
