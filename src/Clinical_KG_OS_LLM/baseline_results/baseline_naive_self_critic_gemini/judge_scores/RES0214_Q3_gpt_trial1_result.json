  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the doctor’s concern for an infectious etiology/COVID-19 was driven by the patient’s fever and sore throat (explicitly cited by the doctor at D-53) and correctly notes the patient also reported a stuffy nose (P-1). It also correctly identifies that the lack of a flu shot this year (P-53) prompted the doctor to raise influenza as a possibility (D-54). No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) fever and sore throat as key infectious/COVID trigger (covered); (2) broader viral symptom cluster including muscle aches (missed); (3) epidemiologic context—husband with similar symptoms supporting COVID being first to rule out (missed); (4) flu shot status: not vaccinated this year leading to influenza differential (covered). Overall, the Generated Answer captures the main symptom triggers and the vaccination-history element but omits the husband/sick contact context and the muscle aches mentioned in the clinician summary.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are supported by the transcript: fever/stuffy nose/sore throat are in P-1; the clinician’s reasoning about fever and sore throat prompting infectious workup is in D-53; flu-shot question and ‘No’ response are in D-53/P-53; and influenza possibility is in D-54. No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question: symptoms prompting suspicion of infectious/COVID and the vaccination-history detail leading to influenza being considered. No meaningful irrelevant material."
