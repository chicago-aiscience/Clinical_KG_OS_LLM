  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main respiratory symptoms in the Gold Answer: cough for 4–5 days and runny nose for a couple of days, and it correctly characterizes the cough as dry/non-productive and the nasal discharge as clear. It is directionally consistent with the cough “not getting better,” though it omits/does not explicitly state the Gold Answer’s point that the cough stayed the same (neither worse nor better). It also adds a “knowledge graph” claim that the runny nose is associated with the cough, which is not stated in the transcript (extra, potentially incorrect/unverifiable).",
    "completeness": "Covers: cough duration (4–5 days), dry/non-productive nature, runny nose duration (past couple of days), and clear nasal discharge; includes denial of sore throat.\nMisses: explicit statement that cough severity stayed the same; explicit denial of bringing up sputum/“gunk” as quoted in Gold; the patient’s comment that he’d never had a dry cough like this before and that prior runny noses didn’t last this long; additional pertinent negatives included in Gold (e.g., no chest pain; no wheezing/shortness of breath).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (cough duration, dry/non-productive, runny nose duration, clear discharge, sore throat denial). However, the “knowledge graph” relationship/association statements are not grounded in the provided transcript and represent unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked respiratory symptoms and their characteristics (productive vs non-productive; discharge appearance). It includes a minor extra item (sore throat denial) and tangential “knowledge graph” commentary, but it remains mostly aligned with the question."
