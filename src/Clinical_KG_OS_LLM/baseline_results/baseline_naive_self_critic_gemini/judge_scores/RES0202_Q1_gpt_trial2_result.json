  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies a dry cough, fever (over 100°F, ~100.1–101), and fatigue/tiredness as reported symptoms. However, it contains a major factual error: it claims the transcript “does not contain explicit patient denials” for chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills, and GI complaints, when the mother explicitly denies these (e.g., “No, I don’t think so” for chest pain/heart racing [P-13]; “Mm I don’t think so” for sore throat [P-14]; “No” for chills/night sweats [P-19]; “No” for diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool [P-22]; “No” for nausea/vomiting [P-23]). It also adds an unsupported ‘knowledge graph’ asthma linkage, which is not part of the question and is not stated as such in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key positives include: dry cough; fever; fatigue; decreased appetite; possible loss of taste; mild runny nose; and uncertainty about shortness of breath. Generated Answer includes only: dry cough, fever, fatigue, and an “might have been harder time breathing” note. It omits decreased appetite, loss of taste, and runny nose. For negatives, it omits many explicitly denied symptoms (no sputum/blood, no wheeze, no rash/skin changes, no urinary changes, no dizziness/fainting, no confusion/memory loss, vision/hearing fine) and incorrectly states several key denials are not explicit. Overall it covers well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: the claim that explicit denials are absent for multiple symptoms directly contradicts the transcript. The ‘knowledge graph’ asthma connection is extraneous and not grounded in the transcript as presented. While some reported symptoms are grounded, there are multiple ungrounded/misrepresented claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at listing reported symptoms and denied symptoms as asked. However, it introduces irrelevant content (the asthma/knowledge-graph linkage) and, more importantly, mis-handles the core asked component (which symptoms were asked and denied). So it is only partially responsive."
