  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the onset of the dry cough on Wednesday evening [P-1], tiredness on Thursday [P-1], worsening cough on Friday [P-1], first-time fever on Friday [P-1, P-2 implicitly as new], and decreased appetite [P-15]. However, it misses explicitly stating the cough was 'a little bit worse' on Thursday (per Gold from P-1 and P-12), does not emphasize fever as emerging for the first time on Friday, omits significant fatigue on Friday [P-25], mild runny nose [P-16], and breakfast disinterest/possible taste loss [P-17]; adds minor speculation on breathing from [P-8] not emphasized in Gold. Core timeline and facts align, with only minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: Wednesday evening cough onset after fine at school; Thursday home, cough persisted (implicit), really tired; Friday cough worsening, fever over 100°F, decreased appetite. Key points missed: Thursday cough specifically 'little bit worse'; fever explicitly 'emerged for the first time'; Friday significant fatigue [P-25], mild runny nose [P-16], disinterest in breakfast/possible taste loss [P-17]; stepwise worsening summary [P-12]; 3-day correction [P-4]. Covers core progression (~70% of details).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: cough Wednesday evening [P-1]; tired Thursday [P-1]; inactivity/breathing speculation [P-8]; cough worsening Friday [P-1]; fever details [P-1, P-2]; appetite [P-15]. Citations accurate, no fabrications or hallucinations; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured day-by-day from Wednesday evening to Friday, directly detailing cough onset (Wednesday evening), changes in severity (worsening progression), fever emergence (Friday), fatigue (Thursday), and decreased appetite (Friday), perfectly matching the question with no off-topic content."
