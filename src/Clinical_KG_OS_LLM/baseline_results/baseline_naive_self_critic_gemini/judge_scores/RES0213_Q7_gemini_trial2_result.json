  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a factual error stating the smoking start age is not specified, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions it was 'probably 18' [P-18]. It also attributes 'shortness of breath' as the documented symptom of teenage anxiety, while the transcript specifically links 'heart flutters' to those past episodes [P-20].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several significant timeline markers found in the Gold Answer, including: the specific age of smoking onset (18), the 8-year period of being symptom-free, the specific counts of cigarettes (10 reduced to 5), and the specific timing of the father's heart attack (last year).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript does not specify the age smoking began, which is a hallucination of absence. It also claims past anxiety attacks were 'documented' as a cause for shortness of breath, which is an inference not directly supported by the text (the patient only links her current nervousness to faster breathing).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the prompt's request to trace the timeline and explain the relationships between the different phases of the patient's history."
