  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the two main respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) with correct durations (4-5 days for cough, couple of days for runny nose), correctly describes the cough as dry/non-productive based on transcript dialogue [D-5,P-5,D-6,P-6], and notes the clear nasal discharge [P-12]. It matches Gold on core facts but introduces unsubstantiated 'knowledge graph' references not present in Gold or transcript, and includes lack of improvement [P-2] akin to Gold's 'stayed the same'. Minor discrepancies from extraneous KG claims and omission of some details like cough stability phrasing and patient history [P-24].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: cough duration [P-2,P-4], dry/non-productive nature [D-5,P-5,D-6,P-6], runny nose duration [P-11] and clear appearance [P-12]. Partially covers cough persistence (lack of improvement vs. 'stayed the same' [P-7]). Includes sore throat denial [P-9] matching a Gold negative. Missed: exact 'stayed the same' phrasing, patient history of novel dry cough and prior shorter runny noses [P-24], chest pain denial [P-15], no wheezing/SOB [P-28]. Covers ~80-90% of key symptom details and some negatives.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom claims (cough dry/non-productive, duration, runny nose clear/duration) verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-2,P-5,P-6,P-11,P-12]. Sore throat denial verifiable [P-9]. However, multiple references to a 'knowledge graph' (classifications, associations) are not in transcript, representing hallucinations. No other fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists and characterizes the reported respiratory symptoms (cough nature, runny nose appearance) as asked. Sore throat denial is a pertinent respiratory check, minor tangent. KG mentions slightly off-topic but tied to symptoms. No major irrelevance."
