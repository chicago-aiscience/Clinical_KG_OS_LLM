  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer states the doctor “did not systematically explore” exposure sources and that there is “no evidence” the doctor asked about living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts. This directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer. In the transcript, the doctor explicitly asked about: where the patient lives (D-45), environmental triggers like dust/mold/pets/asbestos (D-46), contact with sick people (D-47), where the patient works (D-48) and whether anyone at work was sick (D-50), and recent travel (D-49). Therefore the Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer include (1) living situation (apartment in city, lives alone), (2) home/environmental exposures (old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets), (3) sick contacts including possible exposure in work lunchroom, (4) workplace (car dealership) and whether coworkers were sick, (5) travel denied, and (6) substance-use screening noted in the encounter. The Generated Answer includes none of these explored exposures; instead it incorrectly claims they were not asked. Thus it misses essentially all key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not grounded in the transcript: it asserts absence of questioning about exposures, but those questions are clearly present (D-45 through D-50). This is a major contradiction (effectively the inverse of what occurred), so it is largely unfaithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic in that it attempts to address whether and what exposure sources were explored, but it fails to answer the user’s request to list the explored sources and instead denies they occurred. This makes it only partially responsive to the question."
