  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies basic local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) from [P-1], aligning partially with Gold. However, it has a significant factual error by claiming the patient 'reported' joint pain rather than denied it ([P-7]), misinterpreting localized skin soreness ([P-1], where patient specifies 'not the joint itself') as joint pain, directly contradicting Gold and transcript. Fever and headaches denials are correct, but the joint pain error is a major contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: basic local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness), partial location, fever/headache screening/denials. Missed: detailed location ('crease where leg bends', 'stuck pretty good'), clarification ('skin, not joint'), denial of bullseye rash [P-6], 'totally fine' aside from tenderness [P-18], 'pretty healthy' [P-13], full citations for all systemic screenings/denials. Covers ~40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded in transcript with citations (e.g., [P-1] for local symptoms, [D-7/8/19] for screenings). However, hallucinated interpretation that skin soreness equals 'reported joint pain' despite explicit denial [P-7] and clarification [P-1]; incorrectly attributes doctor's summary to support this. Multiple misinterpretations make it not fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses local symptoms at the site and systemic screenings for fever, joint pain, headaches as per question; structured response matches question parts, minor error but no major off-topic content."
