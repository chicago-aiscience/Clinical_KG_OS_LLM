  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states that no specific dosing details were mentioned. However, the transcript specifies that the birth control 'goes for three months' [P-27] and that allergy shots were taken 'once a week for a little while' [P-20]. It also misses the specific name of the birth control ('Deyo').",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer and the prompt's requirements: it omits the brand name 'Deyo', the 'once a week' frequency for allergy shots, the 'three-month' cycle for the pill, and the mention of the EpiPen (which she does not carry).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally grounded in the transcript, but it contains a negative hallucination by claiming no dosing details were mentioned when they were explicitly stated in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure, though it fails to provide the specific details requested in the prompt (names and dosing)."
