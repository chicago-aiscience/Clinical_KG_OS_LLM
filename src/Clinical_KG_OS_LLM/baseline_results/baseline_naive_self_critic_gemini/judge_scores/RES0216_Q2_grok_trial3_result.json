  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer lists only two medications (Ramipril for HBP and salbutamol for asthma), missing Tylenol for headaches which is explicitly stated in Gold and transcript [P-27]. It incorrectly claims no specific information on adherence changes over past years, contradicting Gold and transcript details on skipping evening daily inhaler dose [P-19], no issues with morning-only [P-20], and no refill of rescue inhaler for couple years [P-17,P-18]. References non-existent 'knowledge graph'. Core facts on meds partially correct but significant omissions and errors on adherence.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3 meds (salbutamol inhaler, Ramipril HBP, Tylenol headaches); daily inhaler prescribed BID but now only morning, skipping PM for a while; no rescue refill couple years, none available; justifications and clinician summary. Generated covers Ramipril fully, salbutamol partially as daily for asthma; misses Tylenol; covers 0% of adherence changes (dosing frequency reduction, rescue unavailability over years). Approx 25-30% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Hallucinates 'knowledge graph provided' not in transcript. Claims 'no specific information' on adherence changes, but transcript has explicit details [P-17-20]. Misstates current salbutamol as simply 'daily' without adherence gaps. Misinterprets [D-35] as 'new instruction' for rescue, ignoring patient's prior non-refill [P-17,18]. Multiple unverifiable/untrue claims about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Structure directly addresses medications and adherence question with sections. Includes some accurate med info. Tangents to non-existent knowledge graph and incorrect 'no historical info' claim, but overall focused on query despite errors."
