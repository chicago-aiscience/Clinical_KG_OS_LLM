  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the patient's current statin therapy for cholesterol [P-15] and the proposed prophylactic antibiotics [D-6, D-13, D-18], matching the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancies include omitting the patient's denial of allergies [P-16, P-17], past antibiotic treatment for a prior tick bite [P-3], the plan to consult the supervising physician [D-13, D-22], and environmental prevention with insecticide [D-18]; it also adds a reference to a 'knowledge graph' not present in the Gold or transcript, but no major factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: current statin therapy (yes), proposed prophylactic antibiotics (yes, including rationale and citations). Missed: past treatment history with antibiotics for prior tick bite [P-3], denial of allergies [P-16, P-17], consultation with supervising physician [D-13, D-22], environmental prevention with insecticide [D-18]. Covers approximately 60% of Gold's key points, focusing mainly on current and new treatments.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about statin [P-15], prophylactic antibiotics [D-6, D-13, D-18], tick identification [D-6, D-18], and blood work [D-18] are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations and quotes. Minor hallucination: reference to 'knowledge graph' which is not in the transcript; 'high cholesterol' is a reasonable paraphrase of 'cholesterol' [P-14] but not verbatim.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by detailing the current statin therapy and proposed prophylactic antibiotics for the tick bite, with supporting diagnostics as part of the discussed treatments; no irrelevant or off-topic content."
