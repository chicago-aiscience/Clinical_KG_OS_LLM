  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely correct but identifies only wheezing as the earliest symptom, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer explicitly include 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' as part of what was noticed first (P-2). It also fails to specify that the cough was a more recent development compared to the other symptoms, a distinction made in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary positive respiratory symptoms (wheezy, short of breath, cough, out of breath). However, it misses several characterizing details found in the Gold Answer, such as the cough being non-productive (no phlegm), the denial of cyanosis (not turning blue), and the observation that the child looks fine otherwise. It also misses one of the two symptoms explicitly identified as the earliest (difficulty taking in deep breaths).",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms and timelines mentioned in the generated answer are accurately reflected in the transcript with correct speaker citations. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the prompt regarding the symptoms at presentation and the symptoms that appeared earliest."
