  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately cites patient-reported stuffy nose (initially on/off, stuffy first now mostly running), runny nose for 1 week, clear discharge [P-1-3,5]; mild fatigue; explicit denials of cough [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills [P-7], loss taste/smell [P-16]. Generated Answer partially correct on nasal symptoms (stuffy/runny [P-1]) but misses duration/progression; incorrectly states discharge character as 'runny' [P-1] and attributes 'congestion/drainage' to doctor [D-6] instead of patient's 'mostly clear' [P-5]; wrongly claims patient did not explicitly say 'no' to denials despite direct 'No' responses [P-4,7,16]; lists extras like headaches/N/V; misses post-nasal drip and fatigue. Significant errors/contradictions warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: nasal symptoms (stuffy on/off, runny, 1wk, progression), clear discharge, fatigue, denials (cough, post-nasal, sore throat/SOB/fever/chills, taste/smell). Generated covers stuffy/runny (partial), some denials (cough/sore throat/SOB/fever/chills/taste/smell ~60%), but misses duration/progression/clear discharge/post-nasal/fatigue; adds extras. Covers ~50-79% → 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated verifiable for symptoms [P-1]; but hallucinates patient 'did not explicitly state \"no\"' (contradicts P-4/6/7/16 'No'); misattributes discharge character to doctor [D-6] vs patient [P-5]; references non-existent 'knowledge graph' and 'clinical documentation expert analysis'; multiple ungrounded claims → 2.",
    "relevance": "Generated uses sections directly matching question parts (nasal symptoms, discharge character, denied symptoms); focused despite errors, no tangents → 5."
