  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies three of the four symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat) but incorrectly cites muscle ache as appearing in [P-1] when it actually appears in [P-13]. More critically, it completely misses the pertinent negatives. The Gold Answer clearly shows the patient denied headaches [P-8], neck stiffness [P-7], nausea [P-5], and difficulty swallowing [P-24-26]. The Generated Answer claims there's 'no evidence' of these denials, which is factually incorrect and a major error in clinical documentation.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 40% of the required information. It identifies 3/4 symptoms correctly (missing proper citation for muscle ache) but completely fails to address the second part of the question about pertinent negatives. It only identifies cough as denied, missing headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing - all of which were explicitly denied in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by citing [P-1] for muscle ache when the patient actually reported this in [P-13]. More problematically, it makes the false claim that 'there is no evidence in the provided transcript' of denials for headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing, when these denials are explicitly documented in [P-8], [P-7], [P-5], and [P-24-26] respectively. This represents a failure to accurately represent what's in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question structure but only partially answers it. It attempts to identify the four symptoms and the pertinent negatives as requested, but provides an incomplete and inaccurate response to the second part of the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies three symptoms but contains a citation error for muscle ache. Most critically, it fails to identify four out of five pertinent negatives (headache, neck stiffness, nausea, difficulty swallowing) that are clearly documented in the transcript, incorrectly claiming there's no evidence of these denials. This represents significant factual errors and incomplete coverage of key clinical information requested in the question."
