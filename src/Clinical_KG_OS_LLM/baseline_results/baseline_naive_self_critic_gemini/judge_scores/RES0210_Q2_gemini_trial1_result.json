  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies Lipitor for cholesterol and Tylenol for symptomatic relief, noting the effectiveness as 'helps a little bit'. There is a minor interpretative difference regarding whether Tylenol was for the cough specifically or general symptoms, but given the transcript context (D-13 asking what helps the cough), the generated answer's claim is grounded.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary medications (Lipitor and Tylenol) and their indications and effectiveness. It misses some secondary details found in the gold answer: the generic names (atorvastatin, acetaminophen), the confirmation that Lipitor is the only prescribed medication, and the non-medication measure (clearing gunk). It also omits the patient's allergy status and past cannabis use, though these were not explicitly part of the 'current medications' question.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the provided transcript, even correctly quoting the likely typo in the source text ('haven't taken some Tylenol') while correctly inferring the patient meant they had used it. No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is perfectly relevant, focusing specifically on the medications, their conditions, and effectiveness as requested in the prompt without including the extra-curricular medical history (allergies, lifestyle) found in the gold answer."
