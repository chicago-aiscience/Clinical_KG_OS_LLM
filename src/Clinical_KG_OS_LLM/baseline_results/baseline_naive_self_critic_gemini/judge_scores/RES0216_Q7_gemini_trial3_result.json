{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the patient's walking routine; it states the patient 'maintains their normal daily walking routine', whereas the Gold Answer and transcript (P-22) confirm the patient reduced his walks from a couple a day to just one. It also overlooks the patient's direct statement that the condition has been 'staying the same' over the three days, focusing instead on situational worsening.",
    "completeness": "The answer addresses all parts of the multi-part question: onset, development, evolution (better/worse), specific triggers, and impact on walking. However, it fails to mention that the symptoms did not cause missed work, which was included in the Gold Answer's assessment of functional impact.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer includes a reference to 'Knowledge graph data [KG]', which is not present in the transcript. Furthermore, the claim that the walking routine was maintained is a direct contradiction of the patient's statement in P-22, representing a failure to ground the answer in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, using clear headings that correspond directly to the specific components of the question."
