  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It states that the transcript cuts off before any diagnostic procedures are proposed, but the transcript explicitly shows the doctor proposing a chest X-ray in [D-37] and a COVID-19 swab in [D-39].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the chest X-ray or the COVID-19 swab, nor does it provide the rationale for the swab (institutional protocol for symptomatic patients) which was clearly stated in [D-39].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer inaccurately claims the transcript is incomplete regarding medical decisions. This is a hallucinated limitation, as the provided source text contains the specific information requested.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer fails to address the question entirely, instead providing an incorrect meta-commentary about the source text's sufficiency."
