  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details a precise sequence: stuffy nose first ('just before' fever), sore throat around fever onset, fever for 3 days, muscle aches concurrent (2-3 days). Husband's symptoms started ~4 days earlier (week vs her 3-day fever), with staggered household transmission noted. Generated Answer correctly identifies stuffy nose first, followed by fever (3 days) and sore throat (ongoing), adds muscle ache; notes husband's week-long symptoms vs her 3-day fever, implying earlier onset. Minor discrepancies: sore throat timing not distinguished from fever, muscle ache timing not specified as concurrent/2-3 days, no ~4-day calculation or transmission mention. Core facts consistent, so score 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1. Stuffy nose first [P-1,D-2-P-3]; 2. Sore throat ~fever onset [P-1]; 3. Fever 3 days, doctor summary [P-1,D-3]; 4. Muscle aches 2-3 days concurrent [P-13-P-16]; 5. Husband week (~4 days prior), similar/ongoing [P-19-P-20]; 6. Staggered transmission [D-51,D-53]. Generated covers: stuffy nose first, fever/sore throat after, muscle ache, husband week vs her 3 days. Misses: doctor confirmation, precise muscle timing, exact gap, similarity/ongoing explicit, transmission. Covers ~80-90% of points, score 4.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from transcript: stuffy nose 'just before' [P-1], fever 3 days/sore throat [P-1], muscle ache [P-13], husband week/similar [P-19]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details. Fully grounded, score 5.",
    "relevance": "Directly outlines symptom chronology (stuffy nose -> fever/sore throat/muscle ache) and husband timeline comparison, matching question precisely with no off-topic content. Score 5."
