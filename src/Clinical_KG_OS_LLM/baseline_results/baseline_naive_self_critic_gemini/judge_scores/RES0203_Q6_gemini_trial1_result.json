{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's assessment of COVID-19 symptoms, the diagnostic test (swab), the timeline (1-2 days), and the isolation instructions. However, it contains significant factual errors by explicitly stating that no additional tests were mentioned and that there was no mention of a supervising physician. Both of these are present in transcript segment [D-40].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses two of the specific requirements requested in the prompt: the mention of additional tests and the plan to consult with a supervising physician. According to the Gold Answer, these are key components of the management plan. The Generated Answer covers approximately 66% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails the faithfulness check regarding the final two points. It 'hallucinates' the absence of information that is clearly present in the provided transcript (specifically [D-40]). While the other parts are well-grounded, the explicit denial of existing text is a groundedness failure.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in its structure, addressing each part of the prompt directly. It remains focused on the patient-doctor encounter without introducing outside information."
