  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with both the Gold Answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the assessment (infection/COVID-19), the diagnostic test (swab), the turnaround time (24-48 hours), the isolation period (14 days), the alternative diagnosis (viral illness), the warning signs (fever, neurological/seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting), and the conditional differential (asthma).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers nearly all key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific detail about isolating from the 'younger sister' mentioned in the Gold Answer and the explicit mention that 'no medications were prescribed'. However, it addresses every specific component requested in the question prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript. The use of bracketed citations (e.g., [D-44], [D-45]) accurately corresponds to the sections where the information is discussed. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, providing a structured response that directly answers each part of the multi-part question without unnecessary information."
