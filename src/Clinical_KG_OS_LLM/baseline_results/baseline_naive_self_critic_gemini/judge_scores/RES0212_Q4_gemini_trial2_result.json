  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error by stating that night sweats were 'not explicitly screened for by the doctor,' whereas transcript segment [D-5] clearly shows the doctor asking about them and the patient denying them. It also overlooks the screening for weight loss and hemoptysis (blood in sputum), which are key constitutional symptoms present in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly incomplete. It fails to mention any 'exposure risks' (sick contacts, travel, or substance use) which were specifically requested in the prompt. It only covers a few systemic symptoms (chest pain, nausea, stiff neck) while missing the primary constitutional symptoms of TB mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the absence of information in the transcript by claiming night sweats were not screened. It also incorrectly attributes the denial of nausea, vomiting, and stiff neck to transcript segment [P-19], whereas these were addressed in [P-17] and [P-18].",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in its structure and attempts to address the two parts of the question, but the lack of content regarding exposure risks and the factual errors regarding what was screened reduce its effectiveness."
