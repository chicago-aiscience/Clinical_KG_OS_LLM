  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three main elements requested: respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath), neurological symptoms (seizure with epilepsy diagnosis), and the objective fever measurement (37.4°C). However, it omits the dry cough mentioned in [P-2, P-4], which is a significant respiratory symptom explicitly discussed in the transcript and included in the Gold Answer. This represents a factual incompleteness rather than an error, but the cough is a key clinical finding that should not be omitted.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60-70% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies shortness of breath, the seizure, epilepsy diagnosis, and the temperature reading. However, it misses several important details: (1) the dry cough as a respiratory symptom, (2) timing details (symptoms started ~3 hours before consultation, seizure was previous night), (3) characterization of symptoms (sudden onset for both respiratory symptoms, dry vs productive cough), (4) the patient's description of fever as 'kind of mild', (5) contextual details like feeling 'fine after' the seizure, and (6) pertinent negatives (no chest pain, no feeling faint, no sore throat, no runny nose, no prior shortness of breath episodes).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is fully grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. All three points made are verifiable: shortness of breath in [P-1], seizure and epilepsy in [P-8], and temperature of 37.4 in [P-5]. There are no hallucinated facts or unsupported claims. The answer stays strictly within what was documented in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and objective fever measurement. The response is focused and contains no irrelevant information. However, the incompleteness (missing the cough) means it doesn't fully satisfy the question's intent to capture 'specific respiratory symptoms' (plural)."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately addresses the three main components requested (respiratory, neurological, and fever measurement) with proper citations and no hallucinations. However, it significantly underperforms on completeness by omitting the dry cough as a key respiratory symptom and lacking important contextual details about timing, symptom characterization, and pertinent negatives that provide clinical context. The answer is factually correct for what it includes but represents only a basic summary rather than the comprehensive clinical documentation provided in the Gold Answer."
