    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer lists long-acting beta agonist for mild COPD (P-27/P-28), vitamins (P-30), confirmation these are the only meds (D-29/D-30), no allergies (P-31), self-treatment salt water gargle and painkillers with no relief (P-6), no other therapies, and substance use details. Generated correctly identifies beta agonist for COPD (P-28) and self-treatments (P-6) with no relief. It misses vitamins, allergies, and substance use. Adds irrelevant mono history (P-5) and COVID suspicion (D-43). Introduces non-transcript 'knowledge graph' and placeholders like [MEDICAL_HISTORY]. Core facts match but minor omissions and extraneous details present. Score: 4",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) mild COPD with long-acting beta agonist; 2) vitamins; 3) only these meds confirmed; 4) no allergies; 5) salt water gargle; 6) painkillers; 7) no relief; 8) no other therapies; 9) substance use (smoking quit, alcohol, no cannabis/drugs). Covered: beta agonist, salt water, painkillers, no relief (4/9 points). Missed: vitamins, confirmation only meds, allergies, substance use, explicit mild COPD, no other therapies (5/9). Covers approximately 50-60% of key points. Score: 3",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verified: beta agonist (P-28), self-treatments and no relief (P-6), sore throat (P-2), mono (P-5), COVID suspicion (D-43) all in transcript with accurate citations. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript), placeholders [MEDICAL_HISTORY], [SYMPTOM], [DIAGNOSIS] suggest external assumptions or fabrication. COPD link plausible from P-27/P-28 but 'knowledge graph' is hallucinated. Some unverifiable details but mostly grounded. Score: 4",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on current meds/treatments (chronic prescriptions) and self-treatments for sore throat. Sections 1-2 directly address this perfectly. Section 3 (medical history, suspected diagnosis) is tangential/off-topic. Overall mostly relevant with minor irrelevant content. Score: 4"
