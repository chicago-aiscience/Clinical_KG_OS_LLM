  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It claims the patient reported fever [P-12], nausea and vomiting [P-19], and belly pain [P-20] as part of the initial 'flu symptoms'. However, the transcript shows the patient explicitly denied these symptoms when asked specifically by the doctor. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these as 'pertinent negatives'.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the 'runny nose' symptom which was explicitly confirmed by the patient [P-14]. It also fails to include details about the cough's frequency (3-4 times per hour) and the specific appearance of the mucus (whitish clear) mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the patient confirmed fever, nausea, vomiting, and belly pain. While the patient used the phrase 'all those flu symptoms', they immediately or previously denied those specific components when asked directly. Attributing these symptoms to the patient is a failure of faithfulness to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing the two categories requested (resolved vs. present symptoms)."
