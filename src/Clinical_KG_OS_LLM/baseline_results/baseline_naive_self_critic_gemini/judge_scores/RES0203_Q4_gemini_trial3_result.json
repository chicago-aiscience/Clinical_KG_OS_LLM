  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses the majority of the negative findings identified in the Gold Answer (difficulty breathing, sore throat, chills, muscle aches, chest pain, sputum, cough triggers, etc.). Most critically, the Generated Answer contains an explicit factual error in its concluding note, claiming that 'dyspnea' and 'sore throat' were not in the transcript, whereas they are explicitly screened for in D-11 and D-13.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It lists only three negative findings (fever, headaches, allergies) while the Gold Answer identifies over a dozen specific screenings including systemic symptoms, cough characteristics, and medical history.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails the faithfulness check significantly by claiming that certain symptoms mentioned in the prompt were not present in the transcript. This is a negative hallucination, as the transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about 'difficulty breathing' (dyspnea) and 'sore throat'.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in terms of its structure and attempt to answer all parts of the prompt (listing symptoms and explaining clinical implications). However, its utility is severely limited by the omission of the bulk of the relevant data."
