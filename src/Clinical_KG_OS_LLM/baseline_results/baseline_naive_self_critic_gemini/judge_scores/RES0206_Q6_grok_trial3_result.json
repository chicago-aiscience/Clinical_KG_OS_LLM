  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key elements of the doctor's plan from [D-43] as described in the Gold Answer, including physical exam (vitals and chest auscultation), COVID swab, labs, consultation with attending, disposition criteria based on vitals and labs, and clinical impression of COPD exacerbation due to infection. Minor paraphrasing like 'healthy enough to go home' aligns with 'good to go home' without factual error. No contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam (vitals and chest), tests (COVID swab and labs), clinical impression, consultations (attending), disposition criteria (vitals and labs). Slightly misses explicit reference to temperature check from earlier context [D-11] and patient agreement [P-43], but these are minor as vitals encompass temperature and the plan focuses on doctor's actions; covers ~90-95% effectively.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-43] of the transcript: physical exam details, COVID swab, labs, attending consultation, decision criteria, and COPD suspicion. Citations are accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured perfectly to address the question, categorizing examinations, tests, consultations, and criteria for admission/discharge with no off-topic content."
