  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition deprioritized as “cardiac ischemia / a cardiac ischemic picture” (matches [D-36]). It correctly reports the clinician’s cited rationale that the patient didn’t “really get out of breath with exercise” and that there was no chest pain/pain associated with the tightness (both consistent with [D-36] and supported by patient statements [P-1], [P-5]). No clear factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present. However, it omits additional symptom evidence emphasized in the Gold Answer (e.g., anxiety/sweating/impending doom screening negatives), which affects completeness more than correctness.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) cardiac ischemic picture lower on differential; (2) chest symptoms characterized more as tightness than pain / absence of pain; (3) clinician note of not really getting out of breath with exercise.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (1) explicit inclusion of the patient’s chest complaint being tightness especially with inspiration (pleuritic-like tightness); (2) pertinent negatives of anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom (screened at [D-6], denied at [P-6]) as part of the evidence for lowering ischemia; (3) nuance that patient did report some difficulty getting a full breath ([P-7]) even though clinician summarized “didn’t really get out of breath with exercise.” Overall, it captures the main rationale but not all supporting symptom/absence findings.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made are directly supported by the transcript: ischemic picture lower ([D-36]); no pain ([D-36], [P-1], [P-5]); not really out of breath with exercise ([D-36]). There are no introduced symptoms or conditions not present in the transcript. The answer is well-grounded but incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what condition was lowered on the differential and provides symptom-based reasons (nature of chest complaint and absence of pain/exertional dyspnea). It stays on-topic with no tangential content. It is relevant, though it does not include all the specific symptom absences asked for (e.g., anxiety/sweating/impending doom)."

  "summary": "Accurately and faithfully identifies cardiac ischemia as lower on the differential and cites key supporting symptoms, but omits several specific pertinent-negative findings (anxiety/sweating/impending doom) and some detail about the chest-tightness description, reducing completeness."
