  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline: onset symptoms (SOB, fatigue, weakness/rundown, reduced appetite, laborious breathing), recent subjective fever (yesterday), loss of taste (morning), and emerging cough/sore throat. Minor discrepancies include omission of generalized body aches (noted in Gold as onset per P-20/21), diminished smell (Gold places in morning per P-6), and mild headaches (Gold as emerging); also minor citation errors (e.g., D-6 cited wrongly for sore throat) and unsubstantiated claim of symptom intensification. Core facts align well with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers onset key points (SOB, fatigue/tired/rundown/weakness, appetite loss, laborious breathing; misses body aches); recent (fever, loss of taste; misses explicit smell); emerging (cough, sore throat; misses headaches). Approximately 85% coverage of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims grounded in transcript (e.g., P-1/2/3 for onset, P-4 for fever/taste, P-6 smell implied but not emphasized, P-7/8/9 for emerging, D-36 summary). Minor issues: citation errors (D-6 misused, partial D-36 quote); 'intensified' breathing not directly stated but described in detail (plausible); no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response into three timeline phases directly matching the question's categories (onset couple days ago, recent fever/taste, emerging at consultation), with no off-topic content."
