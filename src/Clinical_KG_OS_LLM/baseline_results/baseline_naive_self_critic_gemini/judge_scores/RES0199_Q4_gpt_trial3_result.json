  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, correctly states that a swab was ordered, correctly gives the expected turnaround time of 24–48 hours, and correctly notes the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if COVID testing is negative. These match the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. No factual contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer includes: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) swab test, (3) 24–48 hour turnaround, and (4) alternative of another viral illness. It omits additional elements present in the Gold Answer: advising isolation for 14 days, public health contact tracing if positive, and supportive management regardless of result. Thus it is not fully complete relative to the Gold Answer text, though it does fully address what the question asked.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements made are directly supported by the transcript, specifically [D-52]. No extra diagnoses, tests, or timelines are introduced beyond what is said. No hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The response stays tightly focused on the asked items (rule-out condition, test + turnaround time, and alternative if negative) and does not add irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "Accurate, transcript-grounded, and directly responsive; slightly less complete than the Gold Answer because it omits isolation/contact tracing/supportive-care details included there."
