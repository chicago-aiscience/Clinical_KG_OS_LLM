  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the initial onset of headache and cough four days ago [P-1], the timing of diarrhea approximately two days ago [P-28], nausea and vomiting a few days back [P-1, P-32], and loss of smell one day ago [P-24], matching the Gold Answer's timeline. It correctly notes headache persistence and 7/10 severity [P-3, P-8] and cough stability and dryness [P-11, P-12], though it does not explicitly state the headache 'stayed around the same' [P-9] or include details like bilateral location [P-5] or atypical nature [P-10]. No factual errors or contradictions, but minor omissions of details present in Gold. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: initial headache and cough 4 days ago; GI symptoms (diarrhea 2 days ago, nausea/vomiting few days back); loss of smell 1 day ago; headache persistent at 7/10; cough dry and stable. Missed: precise headache details (bilateral forehead/top, stayed same severity explicitly, atypical); specific GI details (diarrhea 5-6x/day liquid stools, vomiting yesterday 2 episodes food contents, nausea today); pertinent negatives (no fever/chills, no respiratory worsening). Covers core timeline and stability (80-99% of primary points aligned with question). Score: 4.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: initial symptoms [P-1], diarrhea [P-28], smell [P-24], headache persistent/severity [P-3, P-8], cough dry/stable [P-1, P-12, P-11 implied]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; phrasing like 'nausea and vomiting following shortly thereafter' is reasonably grounded in P-1 and P-32 grouping. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the answer around initial symptoms, relative timing of GI and loss of smell, and stability of headache/cough, with no off-topic content. Score: 5."
