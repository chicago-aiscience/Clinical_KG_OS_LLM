  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies asthma as the condition ruled out despite family history, matching the Gold Answer. It correctly lists the specific symptoms not exhibited (shortness of breath, wheezing) even during physical activity, with direct quotes from [P-28] that align perfectly with the Gold Answer's description of the mother's statements. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: condition (asthma), mother's citations of no shortness of breath/wheezing even with physical activity. Partially covers family history via citation to [P-28] (where grandparents are mentioned), but does not explicitly state 'grandparents' or include details like 'been worked up for that,' mother's conclusion 'he doesn't have that,' or patient's overall healthy history. Covers core elements of the question (80-99%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in [P-28] of the transcript, with accurate quotes ('he doesn't get short of breath... with even with physical activity', 'or wheezing', 'anything like that'). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; perfectly verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses the question by naming the condition (asthma) and listing the exact clinical findings/symptoms not exhibited (including emphasis on 'even during physical activity') cited by the mother, with no off-topic content."
