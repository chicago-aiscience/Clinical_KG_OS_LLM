  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that Jessica's father's allergies, her cousin's asthma, the farm living situation, and the homeschooling/COVID context are 'not mentioned' in the source text. However, the transcript explicitly mentions the cousin's asthma (P-30), the father's allergies (P-33), homeschooling during COVID (P-41), and living on a farm (P-43). Because the answer is built on a false premise that this information is missing, its core factual content is incorrect.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the majority of the specific components requested in the question (family history of allergies/asthma and living situation). It only covers the brother's cold and Jessica's own allergy history, missing the integration of the isolated household environment which is a key part of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a high degree of 'hallucination of absence' by claiming information is not in the transcript when it clearly is. While the points it does include (P-1, P-7, P-16, P-39) are grounded in the text, the overarching claim about missing information is unfaithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant to the specific prompt because it refuses to synthesize the requested factors based on the false claim that they do not exist. It provides general summaries of symptoms and the brother's cold but fails to answer how all the requested factors 'collectively relate' to her symptoms."
