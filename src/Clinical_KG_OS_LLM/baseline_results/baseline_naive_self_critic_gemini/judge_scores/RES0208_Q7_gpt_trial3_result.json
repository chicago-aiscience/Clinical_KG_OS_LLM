  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated answer correctly places SOB/fatigue/weakness/reduced appetite as starting a couple of days prior; subjective fever as “yesterday”; and loss of taste as “this morning.” It also correctly identifies cough and sore throat as only just starting at the time of consultation. Minor inaccuracies include (a) implying symptom “intensification” over time (not clearly stated in transcript) and (b) some muddled attribution/phrasing around who raised cough/sore throat and how (patient primarily reports early cough; doctor later summarizes).",
    "completeness": "Covers major timeline elements (onset SOB/fatigue/appetite loss; yesterday subjective fever; morning loss of taste; emerging cough/sore throat). Misses several Gold Answer elements: diminished smell on questioning (and that sensory change was new), mention of generalized body aches/achiness, and mild headaches (not above baseline). Also does not note that dyspnea was described as “laborious” rather than frank inability to breathe as a key characterization (it partially mentions laborious breathing, but not the contrast).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are supported by the transcript, but there are notable grounding/citation issues: it incorrectly ties the smell question to sore-throat assessment and cites [D-6] in the sore-throat context (D-6 is about smell). Some phrasing suggests steps not in the transcript (e.g., “followed by assessment of throat”) and slightly misframes the cough discussion as the doctor “suggesting” it (though the doctor later summarizes it). Overall, the content is mostly transcript-based but with some inaccuracies/unverifiable linkages.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the requested symptom timeline (onset vs yesterday vs morning vs emerging symptoms) with minimal extraneous information."
