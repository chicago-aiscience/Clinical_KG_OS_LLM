  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns well with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, fever) and explains why the absence of other symptoms (sputum, GI issues, joint pain) supports an upper respiratory infection diagnosis over lower respiratory or systemic infections.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points including the specific symptoms, the timeline (3-4 days), the absence of sputum (URI vs LRI), and the absence of GI/joint pain. However, it misses the point about the brother's recent cold as a source of household viral exposure, which was included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript. While it mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not explicitly provided in the context, the information it attributes to it (the term 'malaise' and its association with the symptoms) is actually present in the transcript at D-15. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses all parts of the question, specifically explaining how both the presence and absence of certain symptoms lead to the URI assessment."
