  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies onset symptoms as SOB, fatigue/rundown/tired/weakness/reduced appetite (P-1,P-2), laborious breathing (P-3), and body aches (P-20,P-21, unspecified onset). Recent: subjective fever yesterday (P-4). Morning: loss of taste (P-4), diminished smell (P-6), new (P-5). Emerging: dry cough 'on its way' (P-7,P-8), sore throat 'starting' (P-9), mild headaches not different from baseline (P-11,P-12). Generated matches core timeline structure and most symptoms: onset SOB/fatigue/weakness/appetite/laborious breathing; recent fever/loss of taste; emerging cough/sore throat. Minor discrepancies: omits body aches, smell loss, headaches; slight misquotes in citations (e.g., D-6 for smell not sore throat, partial D-36 quote) but no factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: onset SOB (yes), fatigue/rundown/tired/weakness (yes), appetite (yes), laborious breathing (yes); fever yesterday (yes); loss of taste morning (yes); cough emerging (yes); sore throat emerging (yes). Missed: body aches (in onset), smell loss (morning), headaches (emerging). Covers ~80-90% of key points, main timeline intact.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: onset from P-1-P-3; fever/taste P-4; cough P-7/D-36; sore throat P-9/D-36/D-8 context. Citations mostly accurate (e.g., P-1, P-2, P-3, P-4, P-7); minor issues like attributing D-6 (smell) to sore throat and partial D-36 quote, but doctor's summary in D-36 directly reflects patient's 'starting' reports (P-7,P-9). No hallucinations; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response into three timeline phases matching question (onset couple days, recent yesterday/morning fever/taste, emerging at consult). No tangents, directly reconstructs symptom timeline from transcript."
