  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately captures quality as initially 'uncomfortable/odd' and later 'sharp, strong pain' on deep breath; episodes 20 min intermittent; occurs when alone (walking to school, studying); resolves/goes unnoticed when social/engaged (talking, hands-on at school); at rest; not worse with exercise; no injury; first time; overall 1.5 weeks. Generated has partial quality match but incorrect citation (P-2 not sharp); correct episode/overall duration; adds frequency (ok); occurrence partial (misses alone); resolution major error - claims no resolution without intervention (meds didn't help but it resolves per P-9) and links to anxiety attack via P-20 (which is about palpitations, not pain); contradicts Gold and transcript on key resolution situations. Significant contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1.5wks overall; dual quality descriptors; sharp on deep breath; 20min episodes; intermittent; occurs walking/studying alone; resolves social/engaged; at rest; not worse exercise; no injury; first time. Generated covers: partial quality; durations; occurrence partial (studying/walking); adds freq/not exertion. Misses alone specifier, resolution situations, at rest, no injury/first time; wrong resolution. Covers ~30-40% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded except: sharp quality cited P-2 (actual P-3); resolution 'does not resolve without intervention' - hallucinated, contradicts P-6/P-9 (20min, goes away at school); 'correlates with anxiety attack' via P-20 - hallucinated (P-20 palpitations, not pain); 'several times a day' D-18 ok; occurrence P-4 ok. Multiple hallucinations on resolution.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around quality, duration, occurrence/resolution as per question; adds frequency but stays on-topic despite errors; no major tangents."
