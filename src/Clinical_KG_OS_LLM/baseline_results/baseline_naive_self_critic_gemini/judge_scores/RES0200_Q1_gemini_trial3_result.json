  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error by claiming the transcript does not contain denials for orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations, and fever. These are explicitly present in the transcript (P-7 for hemoptysis, P-9 for orthopnea, P-10 for PND, and P-14 for palpitations). Additionally, it misses the systemic symptom of 'chills' mentioned in P-29.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses a large portion of the prompt's requirements. It fails to list the denied symptoms (negatives) and omits systemic symptoms like chills. While it covers the worsening cough and shortness of breath, it ignores the vast majority of the 'pertinent negatives' listed in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source text because it asserts information is missing when it is clearly present. This is a form of hallucination regarding the content of the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is only partially relevant. It addresses the respiratory symptoms and sputum changes but completely fails to answer the final part of the question regarding denied symptoms, offering a false statement instead of the requested information."
