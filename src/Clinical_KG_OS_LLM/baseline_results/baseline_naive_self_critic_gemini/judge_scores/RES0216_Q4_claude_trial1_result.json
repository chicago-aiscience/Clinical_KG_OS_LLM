  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemia as the condition placed lower on the differential and accurately cites the two main categories of evidence: absence of chest pain and lack of significant exertional dyspnea. The citations to D-36 are accurate and the core facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points but is less comprehensive than the Gold Answer. It mentions the two primary findings (no chest pain, no significant dyspnea) but omits several key details present in the Gold Answer: the specific patient quotes about tightness vs pain (P-5), the absence of anxiety/sweating/impending doom (P-6, D-6), the screening questions asked by the clinician (D-5, D-6), the patient's relief statement (P-35), and the nuanced detail about some difficulty getting a full breath (P-7). The answer captures approximately 60-70% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations to D-36, P-1 are accurate. The answer does not introduce hallucinated content and stays grounded in what was actually discussed in the consultation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question, identifying the condition deprioritized and the symptom findings used as evidence. It stays focused without irrelevant tangents and structures the response logically around the two main categories of evidence."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemia as the deprioritized condition and accurately cites the two main evidence categories (absence of pain and lack of significant dyspnea). However, it lacks the comprehensive detail of the Gold Answer, omitting specific patient quotes, pertinent negative symptoms (anxiety, sweating, impending doom), and contextual elements. All stated facts are accurate and grounded in the transcript with proper citations. The response is highly relevant and focused on answering the question."
