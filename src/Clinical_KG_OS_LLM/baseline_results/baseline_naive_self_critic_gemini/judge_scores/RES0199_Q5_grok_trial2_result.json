  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims the doctor did not systematically explore living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence (e.g., D-45/P-45 on living, D-46/P-46 on environmental triggers, D-47/P-47 on sick contacts, D-48/P-48 on workplace, D-49/P-49 on travel, D-50/P-50 on sick at work). This is a complete factual contradiction with no alignment to Gold Answer's details.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: timing after P-38; living situation (P-45); environmental triggers (D-46/P-46); sick contacts (D-47/P-47, mentioning work); workplace (P-48/D-50/P-50); travel (D-49/P-49); substance use screening; no clear source. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead fabricating a denial of exploration.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates absence of questions on living (ignores D-45/D-46), sick contacts (ignores D-47), workplace (ignores D-48/D-50), travel (ignores D-49), despite direct transcript quotes; references only D-52 and P-1 irrelevantly, fabricating that no such inquiry occurred.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly responds to the question by denying exploration of the specified sources (living, workplace, travel, sick contacts), with minor tangents on COVID management (D-52) and symptom reporting (P-1)."
