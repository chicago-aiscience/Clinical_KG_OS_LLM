  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts the Gold Answer by claiming the doctor 'did not systematically explore' sources like living situation, workplace, travel, and sick contacts, despite the Gold Answer detailing these with accurate transcript citations (e.g., D-45/P-45 living, D-48/P-48 workplace, D-49/P-49 travel, D-47/P-47/D-50/P-50 contacts). It ignores explicit questions in the transcript and fabricates an absence of inquiry, making it mostly incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: post-P-38 exploration of living (P-45, D-46/P-46), sick contacts (D-47/P-47), workplace (P-48, D-50/P-50), travel (D-49/P-49), substance use (D-42-44), no clear source. Generated covers 0% of these, instead denying all exploration entirely.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates that there is 'no evidence' of questions on living (but D-45/D-46 present), sick contacts (D-47/D-50), workplace (D-48), travel (D-49); misrepresents focus as only symptoms/COVID without exposure history, despite clear transcript sections; citations like [D-52] are accurate but irrelevant to denial.",
    "relevance": "Directly engages the question by addressing the specified sources (living, workplace, travel, sick contacts) but denies exploration instead of listing them; minor tangents on symptom management and COVID but mostly focused on refuting inquiry."
