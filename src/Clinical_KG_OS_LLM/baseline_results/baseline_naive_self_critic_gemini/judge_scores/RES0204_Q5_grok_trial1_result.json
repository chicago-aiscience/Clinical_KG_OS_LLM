  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's inquiry [D-28] connecting to grandparents' asthma history [P-28] and the differentiation via absence of shortness of breath and wheezing even with activity [P-28]. It accurately notes current cough [P-2] and runny nose [P-11]. Minor discrepancies include attributing statements to 'patient' instead of mother, inferring doctor's intent to 'rule out asthma' without direct support, omitting 'worked up for asthma' detail, and including extraneous symptoms (sore throat, fever) not central to Gold Answer's differentiation from asthma. Core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: doctor's inquiry on family respiratory history [D-28 implied], grandparents' asthma [P-28], absence of SOB/wheezing with activity [P-28], current persistent cough [P-2], runny nose [P-11]. Missed: doctor's summary 'some asthma in family' [D-30], child 'worked up' for asthma with negative results [P-28], dry/non-productive nature of cough with citations [D-5/6,P-5/6], clear watery runny nose details [D-11/12,P-11/12], prior respiratory issues shorter/not dry cough [P-24], conclusion as distinct acute event. Covers ~60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims verifiable in transcript: [P-28] for no SOB/wheezing/activity, [P-2] cough duration, [P-11] runny nose, [P-9] no sore throat, [P-13] no fever/chills, [P-16] no nausea/vomiting. Doctor's inquiry [D-28] grounds family history discussion. Minor inference of 'to rule out asthma' and assessing wheezing/SOB is plausible from context but not directly stated by doctor; no fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question: explains connection of grandparents' asthma to doctor's respiratory history inquiry and differentiates current presentation using symptom profile evidence (absence SOB/wheezing [P-28], cough, runny nose), with minor extra symptoms still relevant to overall profile."
