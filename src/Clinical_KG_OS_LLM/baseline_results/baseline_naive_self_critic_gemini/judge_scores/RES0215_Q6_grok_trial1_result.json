  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor's plan is 'not included' in the transcript and claims the transcript ends at [P-44], which is false as the transcript continues to [D-59]/[P-59] where [D-58] explicitly outlines the plan (physical exam, consult physician, discuss next steps). It also misidentifies environmental factors, citing colder weather [P-38] and seasonal allergies [P-35] instead of the home-specific assessments in [D-53] to [D-57] (smoking, carpets, pets, fireplaces, air filters). This contradicts the Gold Answer and transcript on all major facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: doctor's plan (physical exam, consult physician, return to discuss next steps, offer questions); home env factors (townhouse [P-50], smoking denied [P-53], new carpets [P-54], no pets [P-55], no fireplaces/stoves [P-56], air filters changed [P-57]). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying the plan exists and listing irrelevant factors (colder weather, seasonal allergies).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends at [P-44] (actual end is later); references non-existent 'knowledge graph'; cites [P-38]/[P-35] which are accurate quotes but not home environmental assessments before the plan; no verification of actual plan in [D-58] or home env in [D-53]-[D-57]. Largely fabricated claims about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address both parts of the question (plan and env factors) but denies the plan's existence and focuses on wrong environmental details (outdoor/seasonal vs. home-specific), with minor off-topic mention of 'knowledge graph'; partially relevant but derailed by errors."
