{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition as asthma and accurately lists the clinical findings (shortness of breath and wheezing) mentioned by the mother as negatives during physical activity, matching the core facts of the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer identifies the condition and the specific symptoms cited. It misses the contextual detail mentioned in the Gold Answer that the mother explicitly stated the patient had been 'worked up for that,' which provides additional evidence for how the condition was ruled out. It also omits the patient's remark about this being his first dry cough, which the Gold Answer uses to further distinguish the condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is strictly grounded in segment [P-28] of the transcript. It uses direct quotes and accurately represents the patient's lack of symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses the two parts of the question: the condition (asthma) and the findings (shortness of breath, wheezing) during activity."
