  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns closely with the Gold Answer on core facts: timeline includes Friday hiking and Saturday gardening from [P-1], uncertainty of attachment, discovery due to soreness behind left knee with redness/tenderness [P-1], tick removal and container [P-1]. Comparison accurately captures prior ~10-year tick bite with bullseye/target rash and antibiotics [P-3], prior tick 'quite swollen' vs current 'pretty small'/'maybe a little bit' engorged/not as much [P-3,P-4]. Minor discrepancies: omits Strathroy location [P-12], 'earlier today' discovery timing, exact knee crease location, doctor's >72-hour estimate [D-6], doctor's 'grape' analogy [D-4], and explicit lack of bullseye rash now [P-6]; citation of [D-6] for prior rash is indirect as doctor summarizes patient's history. No contradictions, core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: hiking Friday [P-1], gardening Saturday [P-1], uncertain timing/hope from hiking [P-1], soreness/red/tender behind knee [P-1], container [P-1], prior ~10y bullseye/antibiotics [P-3], prior swollen vs current less engorged/small [P-3,P-4], current localized/not as bad [P-1,P-3]. Missed: Strathroy [P-12], 'earlier today' [P-1], knee joint/crease detail [P-1,D-1], >72h estimate [D-6], doctor's grape confirmation [D-4], no larger circle rash now [P-6]. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: timeline and symptoms from [P-1,P-3,P-4]; prior history from [P-3] (synonymous 'target rash' as bullseye). [D-6] citation for prior rash is doctor's recap of patient's report, not new info. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by structuring response into timeline (Fri hike -> Sat garden -> discovery/presentation) and direct comparison of current local symptoms/engorgement vs prior bullseye/antibiotics experience. No off-topic content; focused and comprehensive to query."
