  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all three key factors mentioned in the Gold Answer: acid reflux managed by diet alone, hay fever, and hospital clerk occupation with PPE use. The factual details align well with the transcript citations. However, it adds some interpretive clinical reasoning (e.g., 'GERD-induced cough,' 'post-nasal drip') that goes beyond what's explicitly documented, though these are clinically reasonable inferences. The Gold Answer is more conservative in staying closer to what's documented versus what might be clinically inferred.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: (1) acid reflux managed by diet without medication, (2) hay fever as airway sensitivity, (3) hospital clerk occupation with exposure risk and PPE use, and (4) the post-viral pattern where flu symptoms resolved but cough persisted. It also mentions the anxiety history and workplace stress context. The Generated Answer provides additional clinical interpretation and a summary section, making it comprehensive though slightly different in structure.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is largely grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations [P-22], [P-25], [P-27], [P-17], etc. However, it makes some clinical inferences not explicitly stated in the transcript (e.g., 'GERD-induced cough,' 'post-nasal drip,' 'chronic irritant'). The Knowledge Graph reference about hospital-cough-PPE linkage is not verifiable in the provided transcript. The Gold Answer is more faithful by explicitly noting what is NOT described (e.g., 'transcript does not describe current allergy symptoms').",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about how acid reflux, hay fever, and occupational exposure relate to the persistent cough. It structures the response around these three factors and connects them to the clinical presentation. The summary section reinforces relevance. However, some content (like the detailed differential diagnosis formatting) goes slightly beyond what the question specifically asks for, though it remains clinically relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all three relevant factors (acid reflux, hay fever, hospital occupation) and provides appropriate transcript citations. It covers the key points about dietary management without medication, allergic history, PPE use, and the post-viral pattern. However, it includes more clinical interpretation and inference than strictly documented in the transcript (e.g., GERD-induced cough mechanisms, post-nasal drip), reducing faithfulness compared to the more conservative Gold Answer. The response is relevant and comprehensive but occasionally extends beyond what's explicitly stated in the source material."
