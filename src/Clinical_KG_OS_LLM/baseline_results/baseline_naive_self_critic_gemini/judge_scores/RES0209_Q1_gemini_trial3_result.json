  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains two significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript: it claims the patient did not confirm chest tightness, whereas the transcript shows a direct 'Yes' at P-20. It also states the patient did not provide a specific count for nighttime symptoms, whereas P-18 explicitly mentions 'every other day' or 'every two days or so'.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the 'two week' duration of the cough mentioned in the Gold Answer. It also fails to capture the specific frequency intervals for nighttime symptoms and the detail that wheezing occurs more often than bronchodilator use.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes claims that are contradicted by the transcript (hallucinating that information is missing when it is present). Specifically, the note regarding chest tightness and the claim about the lack of specific nighttime frequency are direct contradictions of the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in its structure, addressing each part of the prompt (cough character, breathing, wheezing, chest sensations, and frequency comparison) even though some of the information provided is factually incorrect."
