  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer’s core facts: (1) symptoms considered consistent with COVID-19, (2) plan for a COVID swab and a chest X-ray, (3) isolation until results return, and (4) continued isolation even with a negative result if symptoms persist. Minor phrasing (“confirm the diagnosis”) slightly overstates certainty but does not contradict the plan described in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key elements asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer: overall assessment (COVID-consistent symptoms), both diagnostic tests (COVID swab, chest X-ray), isolation until results, and the condition for continued isolation (persistent symptoms despite a negative test). It omits secondary contextual details included in the Gold Answer (e.g., that the clinician would consult the supervising doctor and return to discuss next steps; rationale tied to dyspnea/COPD).",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims are grounded in [D-43]. No clear hallucinated tests or instructions are added. The mention of evaluating “respiratory status via imaging” is supported by the planned chest X-ray in [D-43].",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question components (assessment, tests, isolation instructions, and when isolation continues after results) with no meaningful tangents."
