  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition and the presence of fever as the clinical finding that excluded it from the current workup, which is perfectly aligned with the Gold Answer and the transcript [D-45].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all primary key points: the condition (asthma), the hypothetical scenario (if there was no fever), and the actual clinical finding (fever) that shifted the diagnosis toward infection. It omits the supporting details about the absence of wheezing mentioned in the Gold Answer, but these were secondary to the doctor's specific reasoning in [D-45].",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in the transcript. It accurately quotes [D-45] and references the temperature reported in [P-1] and [P-2]. It notes the doctor's mention of a 5-day duration in [D-3], though it doesn't mention the parent's correction in [D-4], which is a minor detail irrelevant to the core question.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without unnecessary information."
