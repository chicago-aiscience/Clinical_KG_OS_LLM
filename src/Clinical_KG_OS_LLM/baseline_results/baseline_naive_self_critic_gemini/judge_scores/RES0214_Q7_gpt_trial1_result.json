  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the first symptom as a stuffy nose and notes that fever has been present for three days at presentation, consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer. It also correctly mentions sore throat is present and ongoing, and that muscle aches occurred. However, it is less precise than the Gold Answer about the sequence/timing: it does not clearly place sore throat as the next symptom around fever onset, and it omits that muscle aches were specifically over the past 2–3 days and explicitly concurrent with the fever. The husband’s timeline is stated correctly as “past week,” but the Generated Answer does not make the Gold Answer’s explicit comparison that this implies his onset preceded hers by several days.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) stuffy nose first; (2) fever present for 3 days; (3) sore throat present/ongoing; (4) husband with similar symptoms for ~1 week.\nMissed/underdeveloped relative to Gold: (1) explicit chronological placement of sore throat as the next symptom around fever onset; (2) muscle aches duration (2–3 days) and explicit overlap with fever; (3) explicit comparison that husband’s onset was several days earlier than patient’s (staggered onset); (4) husband described as still having similar symptoms (“same as me”); (5) (optional interpretive point in Gold) household transmission context.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are supported by the transcript (stuffy nose preceding fever; fever for three days; sore throat still present; muscle aches reported; husband symptomatic for a week). No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the requested symptom chronology and comparison with the husband’s onset; no notable irrelevant content."
