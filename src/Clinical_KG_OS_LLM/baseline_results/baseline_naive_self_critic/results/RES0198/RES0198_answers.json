The patient noted that despite using decongestants, \"my nose is runny now\" [P-10].\n\n**Explicitly Denied Symptoms**\nThe provided transcript segments do not contain explicit verbal denials of specific conditions like sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, fever, chills, or loss of taste and smell (which were all asked about by the doctor in [D-7], [D-16], and [D-28]).

The doctor explicitly correlated these specific symptoms—describing them as \"a stuffy nose in the runny nose\"—with a **viral infection like the common cold** [D-39]. The \"on and off\" nature mentioned by the patient [P-1] and the typical duration of the common cold (\"a few weeks\" for relief) [D-39] further support this classification.\n\n**Diagnostic Correlation:**\nThe doctor’s statement that the presentation fits the \"common cold\" implies that the differential diagnosis of allergies (which were discussed but not fully confirmed in the provided text) was less likely than a viral etiology based on the physical symptoms alone. The doctor also noted the possibility of COVID-19 due to the pandemic context, but the management plan of using over-the-counter medications like **Tylenol cold** [D-39] and supportive care aligns with the treatment of a common viral upper respiratory infection [D-39].",
