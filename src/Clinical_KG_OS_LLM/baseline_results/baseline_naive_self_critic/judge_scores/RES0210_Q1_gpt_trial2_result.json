  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most stated facts align with the transcript: productive cough [P-1], sputum described as “yellow custard” with “spots of red” [P-6], right-sided chest pain [P-17], and chills [P-9]. However, it inaccurately/downplays the cough timeline by summarizing it as only “a couple of days” [P-1], whereas the history indicates a raspy cough starting Friday with worsening by Sunday [P-3, P-4]. It also omits key qualifiers (e.g., blood-tinged nature, pleuritic worsening, constant/dull pain), but omissions are scored under completeness rather than correctness.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: cough present; sputum color/appearance (yellow custard with red spots); chest pain location (right); chills. Missing: (1) cough course (raspy Friday → severe Sunday), (2) sputum timing (yellow + red started together on Sunday), (3) chest pain quality and pattern (constant, dull, present at rest/lying down), (4) exacerbating factors (worse with cough and deep breath), (5) fever/subjective hot feeling starting Monday and persisting, (6) mild dyspnea on exertion, (7) sore/raw throat after coughing, (8) resolved runny nose, and (9) pertinent negative of no weight loss. Overall, it captures well under half of the required symptom details.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are directly supported by the transcript and the cited turns are appropriate. No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the patient’s reported symptoms (cough, sputum, chest pain, systemic symptoms) and does not introduce unrelated material. It is incomplete but still directly addresses the question scope."
