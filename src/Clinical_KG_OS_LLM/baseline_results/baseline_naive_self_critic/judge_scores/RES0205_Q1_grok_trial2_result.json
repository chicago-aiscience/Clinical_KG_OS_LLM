  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the persistent dry cough, chest soreness with coughing, and resolved early symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, mucus/productive phase) without any factual contradictions to the Gold Answer or transcript; minor simplifications in phrasing (e.g., 'chest pain (or soreness)' aligns with patient's description of soreness post-coughing, denying independent pain) but all facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: persistent dry cough [P-2,P-5], chest soreness with coughing [P-15,P-16], resolved sore throat [P-13 via P-14], runny nose [P-14], early mucus/productive cough [P-5,P-6]; missed: specific timelines (e.g., sore throat 2-3 days, mucus 4-5 days, flu symptoms resolved 3-4 days), cough details (3-4x/hour [P-9], spontaneous [P-10], stable intensity/frequency [P-7,P-8]), 'flu symptoms' collective phrasing, pertinent negatives (no SOB [P-11], no fever [P-12], no N/V [P-19], no abd pain [P-20]) – covers core symptoms (~60-70% of Gold's granularity).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: cough 2 weeks dry [P-2,P-5], chest soreness [P-15,P-16], early mucus [P-5], flu-like incl sore throat/runny nose [P-13,P-14]; no hallucinations, 'flu-like symptoms' grounded in patient's wording [P-14].",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response around current vs. resolved symptoms directly matching the question, with no off-topic content or tangents."
