  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links the factors to an atopic profile, asthma association, viral triggers for hyperresponsiveness, potential irritant from carpets (no temporal link), cold as bronchospasm trigger, and synthesis to hyperresponsive airways. Generated Answer lists factors but inaccurately claims recurrent viral infections are 'associated with the wheezy symptoms currently being reported' (transcript [P-15] describes past infections unrelated to current 4-5 day episode), includes fake citation [KG], omits nuances like no antibiotics [P-16], no direct carpet-symptom link, and atopic/asthma context; main idea of triggers/susceptibility is similar but with factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: atopic from allergies [P-35/36]; viruses trigger inflammation [P-15/16]; carpets potential irritant, no temporal link [P-54]; cold trigger [P-38]; other env neg [P-53-57]; exercise/rest pattern [P-3/6/41]; overall hyperresponsive atopic airways. Generated covers allergies, viruses, carpets, cold/exercise but misses atopic/asthma link, virus mechanism, carpet nuance, other env factors, full synthesis; covers ~60% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: allergies [P-35/36], viruses [P-15], carpets [P-54], cold/activity [P-3/38]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: viruses 'associated with current wheezy symptoms' (not in transcript), [KG] fake citation, 'baseline respiratory vulnerability' from viruses/allergies plausible but not explicit, carpets as 'contributing to irritation' inferred but overstated; multiple issues indicate hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists and relates the four specified factors (allergies, viruses, carpets, cold) to exercise-induced symptoms as susceptibility/triggers, though adds unasked symptom recap; mostly on-topic."
