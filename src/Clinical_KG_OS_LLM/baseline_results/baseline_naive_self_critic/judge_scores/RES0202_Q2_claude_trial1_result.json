  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the three key management measures from the Gold Answer: COVID swab test, 14-day isolation, and specific mention of the younger sister. All facts are consistent with the source transcript and Gold Answer. The citations are accurate ([D-44] is correct for all three points).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main management points but omits several important details from the Gold Answer: (1) COVID test results timeframe (24-48 hours), (2) rationale for isolation being symptom alignment with COVID-19, (3) the phrase 'if possible' regarding separation from sister, (4) return-to-care precautions (ER visit criteria: high fever, neurological symptoms, weakness, dizziness, fainting), (5) acknowledgment of false-negative possibility, (6) alternative diagnosis consideration (other viral illness), (7) no medications prescribed, (8) school's requirement for COVID test. These omissions represent approximately 60% of the Gold Answer's content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-44]. The citations are accurate and specific. No hallucinated information is present. The answer stays grounded in what was explicitly stated in the consultation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: diagnostic tests (COVID swab), isolation instructions and duration (14 days), and the specific household member mentioned (younger sister). The content is perfectly focused without any irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually correct and highly relevant, accurately capturing the three main management measures with proper citations. However, it lacks completeness by omitting important details such as test result timeframe, return-to-care precautions, possibility of false negatives, and the school's testing requirement. The answer is fully grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations."
