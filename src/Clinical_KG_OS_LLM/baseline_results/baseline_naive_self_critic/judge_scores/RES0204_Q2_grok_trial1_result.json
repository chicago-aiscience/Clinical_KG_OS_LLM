  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer confirms no medications and proposes chest X-ray (D-37, might from supervising doctor, described as internal picture D-39) and COVID nasal swab (D-39, rationale: protocol for anyone with symptoms). Generated Answer accurately identifies both procedures with correct citations, quotes rationale verbatim, and infers chest X-ray examines lungs (plausible for chest X-ray). No factual errors or contradictions; minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'proposed performing' vs. 'might want') but core facts match fully.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: no meds/history (premise), chest X-ray details (might, supervising, description), COVID swab (nasal, rationale/protocol, discomfort/bravery), plan to arrange/discuss, no treatments. Generated covers both procedures with cites, exact swab rationale, links to symptoms; misses X-ray patient explanation, discomfort details, plan, no treatments, supervising doc nuance. Covers ~85% of key points, strong on core question elements (procedures + swab rationale).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from transcript: chest X-ray [D-37], COVID swab [D-39] with accurate quote. 'Examine the lungs' is verifiable inference (chest X-ray context, doctor listened to lungs [D-1]). 'Standard precautionary... coughing' grounded in rationale [D-39] and symptoms [P-2]. No hallucinations; citations precise.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists proposed procedures (both named with cites) and dedicates section to exact swab rationale per question; structured response perfectly matches query focus, no tangents."
