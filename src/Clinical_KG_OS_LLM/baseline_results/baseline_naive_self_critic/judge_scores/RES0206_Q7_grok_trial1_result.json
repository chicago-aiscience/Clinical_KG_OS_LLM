    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the baseline manageability with puffers [P-1], acute symptoms over 3 days including increased cough, green-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, and dyspnea [P-1], progressive worsening [P-2 implied], and states this is the worst episode compared to priors worsened by illness [P-3]; however, it omits specifics like lifestyle management [P-28], rescue inhaler frequency [P-26], detailed exercise tolerance [P-4], fever [P-9], and prior ED visits without hospitalization [P-5,P-6], and adds interpretive doctor confirmation [D-43] and unsubstantiated knowledge graph references not in Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: baseline manageability with puffers [P-1], 3-day symptoms (cough, sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis [P-1]), worsening trend [P-2], worst severity and prior sick-triggered episodes [P-3]; missed: lifestyle efforts [P-28], inhaler use every 2 weeks [P-26], routine dog walks now trickier but able to walk to clinic [P-4], possible fever [P-9], two ED visits in 3 years no overnight stays [P-5,P-6] – covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable in transcript (e.g., symptoms [P-1], worsening [P-2], severity [P-3], doctor's suspicion [D-43]); however, repeated references to 'knowledge graph information' and 'clinical indicators...in the knowledge graph' are not in transcript, introducing hallucinated external sources; minor interpretive additions like 'acute onset' and 'significant deterioration' are plausible but not verbatim.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom evolution from baseline to acute 3-day presentation, confirms worsening over time, and compares severity to priors; minor tangents include doctor confirmation and knowledge graph mentions, but overall focused on question."
