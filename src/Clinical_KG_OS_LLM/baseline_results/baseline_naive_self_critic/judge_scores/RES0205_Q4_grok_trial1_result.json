  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition ruled out and the COVID test as the specific test used, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-35]. It accurately notes the negative result implicitly. Workplace concerns are partially correct (hospital job [P-34], coworkers scared [P-35]), but misses details like PPE [P-17], staying home, eagerness to return, and medication desire driven by concerns [P-36]. Major discrepancy: incorrectly states timing is 'not explicitly detailed' despite clear evidence in [P-36] ('test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago'), contradicting Gold Answer's accurate summary. Thus, some factual errors on key timing but core elements correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: COVID-19 (covered), covid test [P-35] negative (covered), timing at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior [P-36] (missed, wrongly claimed not detailed), workplace concerns including hospital clerk [P-34] (covered), PPE [P-17] (missed), coworkers scared [P-35] (covered), staying home/return concerns/meds [P-35,P-36] (partially missed). Covers condition, test, partial concerns (~60% of details), misses timing fully.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: condition/test [P-35], cough duration [P-2], job/scared coworkers [P-34,P-35]. However, 'Knowledge Graph' not in transcript (hallucination), 'exclusionary documentation' not mentioned (plausible but unverifiable). Timing claim 'not explicitly detailed' ignores [P-36] but doesn't fabricate facts. Minor unverifiable details, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to question's four parts (condition, test, timing, concerns) with bold headings, no off-topic content, perfectly focused despite incompleteness."
