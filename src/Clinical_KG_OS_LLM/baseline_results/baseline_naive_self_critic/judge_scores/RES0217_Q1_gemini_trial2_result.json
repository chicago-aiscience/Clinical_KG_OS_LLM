  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not indicate a screening for headaches. In the transcript, at [D-19], the doctor explicitly asks, 'So no headaches?', and the patient denies it at [P-19]. This contradicts the Gold Answer and the source text. Most local symptoms and other systemic symptoms are correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the 'stuck pretty good' detail regarding local symptoms and the denial of the bullseye rash. More importantly, it completely fails to include the screening for headaches, which was one of the three specific systemic symptoms requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a hallucination of omission/negation by claiming the transcript does not contain information about headaches, when it is clearly present in the dialogue [D-19, P-19].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, attempting to address both local and systemic symptoms as requested, but its utility is compromised by the incorrect claim regarding the headache screening."
