  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The local symptom description (redness, tenderness, localized soreness behind the knee) aligns with the transcript and Gold Answer. However, the Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it states the transcript does not indicate the doctor screened for headaches, but the transcript clearly shows the doctor asking “So no headaches?” [D-19] and the patient denying them [P-19, P-20]. Because the question explicitly asks for systemic symptoms including headaches, this is a significant inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "Covered: localized redness, tenderness, soreness behind the left knee; screened/denied joint pain and fever/feeling ill.\nMissed: (1) the tick being “stuck pretty good,” (2) clearer localization to the crease behind the knee and the patient’s clarification that it was skin/area soreness “not the joint itself,” (3) explicit denial of a bullseye/target rash and “larger circle rash,” and (4) headache screening and denial. Overall, it captures some but not all key elements from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most quoted/local claims are grounded in the transcript. The major unfaithful element is the explicit note claiming headache screening is not in the transcript, which directly contradicts [D-19, P-19, P-20]. The added interpretive phrasing about denial (“by focusing solely on localized symptoms”) is not stated verbatim but remains plausible; the headache claim is the primary faithfulness problem.",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally focused on the requested local symptoms and systemic screening items. The incorrect exclusion of headaches undermines the central request but does not introduce major off-topic content."

  "summary": "Mostly relevant and partially complete, but it contains a major error by incorrectly stating headaches were not screened despite clear transcript evidence, and it omits several Gold Answer details (notably the bullseye rash denial and “stuck pretty good”)."
