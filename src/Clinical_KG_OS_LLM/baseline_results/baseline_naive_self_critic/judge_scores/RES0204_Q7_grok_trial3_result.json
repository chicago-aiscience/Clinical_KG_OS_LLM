  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes the cough onset at 4-5 days [P-2], but incorrectly states the cough has 'persisted or worsened' (contradicting P-7 'stayed the same'), fabricates a 'clinical knowledge graph', erroneously claims no runny nose information despite explicit mentions [P-11, P-12], and misrepresents prior history by focusing on fever/chills/asthma instead of novel dry cough and longer runny nose duration [P-24]; multiple contradictions to Gold Answer yield low factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: cough 4-5 days first/dry/non-productive/unchanged severity; runny nose later (couple days)/clear; novel dry cough/past shorter runny noses/no SOB. Generated covers only cough duration partially (~20%); misses runny nose entirely, severity details, dry confirmation, and accurate priors comparison.",
    "faithfulness": "Hallucinates 'clinical knowledge graph' and 'no clinical information' on runny nose despite direct transcript evidence [P-11 'past couple of days', P-12 'pretty clear']; misinterprets cough severity (P-7); unverifiable/inaccurate claims on procedures confirming dry cough subtype; largely not grounded.",
    "relevance": "Structures response around symptom onset, cough vs. runny nose timing, and priors, directly attempting to address the question, but includes minor off-topic elements like fever/asthma details; partially relevant despite errors."
