  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the plan described in the transcript and Gold Answer: quick physical exam [D-18], tick sent for species identification [D-18], Lyme-related bloodwork/serology [D-18], and prophylactic antibiotics based on likely prolonged attachment time (\"longer than at least 72 hours\") [D-6]. It also correctly includes the intent to speak with another physician/doctor after the exam [D-18].\nMinor issue: it adds an interpretation that the consulted doctor is “likely a colleague or specialist,” whereas the transcript more strongly implies an attending/supervising physician rather than a specialist referral; this is a small over-interpretation but does not change the core plan.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) physical exam, (2) tick lab ID, (3) bloodwork for Lyme titres/serology, (4) prophylactic antibiotics, (5) plan to speak with physician, (6) preventive advice about tick habitat/long grass/edges and insecticide.\nNot fully covered: the rationale that Strathroy/geographic risk contributed to the decision to proceed with antibiotics [D-13], and the nuance that no specific antibiotic/dose/duration was provided. These omissions keep it from being fully comprehensive relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript and align with the cited lines (especially [D-18] and [D-6]). The only mildly ungrounded element is characterizing the other doctor as “likely a colleague or specialist,” which is not explicitly stated. Otherwise, no major hallucinated tests or treatments were introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested components: diagnostic tests (physical + lab), treatments, planned physician consultation, and preventive/environmental advice related to the garden/outdoors. No meaningful irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate, well-grounded, and directly addresses the question, but misses a couple of Gold-plan nuances (notably the geographic-risk rationale) and includes a small speculative interpretation about the physician consultation."
