  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the assessment of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 [D-39], the COVID test via swab [D-39], self-isolation instructions [D-39], and timeline [D-39], matching Gold. However, it adds unsubstantiated 'hypothesis of suspected COVID-19' and 'knowledge graph' not in Gold or transcript. Critically, it incorrectly states no mention of consulting a supervising physician despite [D-40] in both transcript and Gold ('we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today'), and omits 'patient otherwise well' [D-16]. These are significant contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covered from Gold: symptoms consistent with COVID [D-39]; COVID test with swab [D-39]; self-isolation details [D-39]; timeline 'one to two days' [D-39]. Missed: 'patient otherwise well' [D-16]; possible additional tests [D-40]; plan to consult supervising physician [D-40]; potential more questions [D-40]; reassurance 'taken care of shortly' [D-41]. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on test, isolation, timeline verifiable in [D-39]. 'Knowledge graph linking symptoms' and 'hypothesis of suspected COVID-19' not in transcript (hallucination). Incorrectly claims 'transcript segments do not contain any mention of a plan to consult with a supervising physician' – directly contradicted by [D-40]. Multiple hallucinations and false denial.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around assessment and management plan, addressing core question elements like tests, self-care, timeline; minor irrelevant addition of 'knowledge graph'; no major off-topic content."
