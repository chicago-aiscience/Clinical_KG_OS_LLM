  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports all mentioned symptoms with correct citations matching the Gold Answer and transcript (e.g., increased cough [P-1], green yellowy sputum [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], shortness of breath [P-1], fever [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12], cough as most bothersome [P-12]). Minor discrepancies include categorizing sinus pressure under respiratory (Gold lists it as systemic), omitting reduced exercise tolerance [P-4] and headache [P-14], and mentioning a 'knowledge graph' not present in the Gold or transcript; however, core facts are fully consistent with no factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: increased cough frequency, increased sputum (green yellowy), hemoptysis, worsened dyspnea/shortness of breath, sinus pressure, possible fever, cough as most bothersome (100% of these). Missed: reduced exercise tolerance [P-4] ('a little bit trickier' to walk dog/walk block), mild headache [P-14]; does not include pertinent negatives from Gold. Covers approximately 80-90% of key positive symptom points.",
    "faithfulness": "All specific claims (symptoms and quotes) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-12], [P-9]). Minor unverifiable detail: reference to 'knowledge graph,' which is not in the transcript (potential hallucination). No other fabricated content; fully grounded otherwise.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists respiratory and systemic symptoms from the 3-day worsening period with citations and identifies the most bothersome symptom (cough), perfectly matching the question without irrelevant content or tangents."
