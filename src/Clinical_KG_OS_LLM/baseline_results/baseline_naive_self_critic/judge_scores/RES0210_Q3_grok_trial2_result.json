  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures core facts like productive cough with yellow sputum and red spots (citing P-4, P-6), chills (P-9), exertional dyspnea (P-10), and right-sided pleuritic chest pain worsening with deep breathing/coughing (P-17, P-18, P-19), matching the Gold Answer. Minor discrepancies include not emphasizing constant dull pain at rest (P-20, P-21), indirect handling of fever (P-8) via association rather than direct citation, and labeling red spots as 'hemoptysis' (plausible but not exact phrasing). No major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: sputum details (yellow custard + red spots), systemic signs (chills, implied fever), exertional dyspnea details, pleuritic pain worsening with cough/breathing, and right-sided localization. Misses smoking history as risk factor (P-37, P-38) and full chest pain characterization (constant dull even at rest). Approximately 80-90% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: sputum, chills, dyspnea, pain location/quality directly from cited transcript sections. However, introduces unverifiable 'knowledge graph' references (e.g., chills-fever link, exertion-pain) not in transcript; misapplies P-15 (sore throat) to chest pain mechanism; describes pain as 'sharp, position-dependent' contradicting 'dull' (P-21). Multiple hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing transcript findings supporting LRTI/pneumonia and explaining pleuritic pain's diagnostic role with structured, focused response; no off-topic content."
