  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer on all included items: COVID swab testing was recommended, results expected in 24–48 hours (though not mentioned explicitly in the Generated Answer), isolation was advised for 14 days, and the child was specifically to isolate from his younger sister if possible. No statements in the Generated Answer contradict the Gold Answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points in the Gold Answer: (1) COVID swab recommended, (2) results in 24–48 hours, (3) isolate for 14 days, (4) isolate from younger sister, (5) false-negative possibility/other viral illness possible, (6) ER/return precautions (high temperature, neuro symptoms/seizures, weakness/dizziness, fainting), (7) supportive/observe and wait for swab. The Generated Answer covers (1), (3), and (4), but omits (2) and the additional management guidance/precautions (5–7). Given the question asks for “specific management measures” (not only isolation/testing), these omissions reduce completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (D-44). No hallucinated medications, diagnoses, or additional instructions are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the elements explicitly requested in the question: diagnostic test, isolation instructions with duration, and the household member to isolate from. It contains no irrelevant tangents."
