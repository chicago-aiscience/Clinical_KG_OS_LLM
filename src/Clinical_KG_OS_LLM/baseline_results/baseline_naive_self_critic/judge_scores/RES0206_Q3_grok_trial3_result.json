  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer clearly separates symptoms supporting COPD exacerbation (increased dyspnea [P-1], cough frequency [P-1], sputum volume [P-1], exercise tolerance [P-4]) from those supporting infection (green-yellow sputum [P-1], fever [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12], headache [P-14], sick contact [P-20]), with sputum/fever distinguishing infectious trigger. Generated Answer lists some overlapping symptoms (cough, sputum color, fever, sinus) but inaccurately claims they primarily indicate COPD exacerbation per non-existent 'knowledge graph,' contradicting Gold's distinction of infection trigger; misses key COPD symptoms like dyspnea and exercise tolerance; significant contradictions on differentiation.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: COPD symptoms (dyspnea, cough freq, sputum vol, exercise tol); infection symptoms (sputum color, fever, sinus, headache, sick contact); distinction via sputum/fever; past pattern [P-3]; excluded triggers [P-38, P-26]; no obj findings. Generated covers cough freq [P-1], sputum color/vol vaguely [P-1], fever [P-9], sinus [P-12], sick contact [P-20], past [P-3] (~50-60% coverage); misses dyspnea, exercise tol, headache, exclusions, no obj findings.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in transcript include cough [P-1], sputum [P-1], fever [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12, but calls 'stuffy nose'], sick contact [P-20], past [P-3], doctor's assessment [D-43]. Multiple hallucinations: repeated 'knowledge graph' references not in transcript, false associations (sputum/fever as KG indicators of COPD exac, stuffy nose from KG); infers COVID-19 specifically beyond transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around symptoms supporting dual assessment and differentiation of sputum/fever, matching question; minor off-topic via hallucinated KG but overall focused."
