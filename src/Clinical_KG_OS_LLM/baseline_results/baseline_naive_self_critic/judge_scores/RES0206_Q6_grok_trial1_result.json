  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main elements of the doctor's plan from [D-43], including physical exam (chest auscultation), vitals check, COVID swab, labs, consultation with attending, and criteria for disposition (labs and vital signs). However, it omits the preliminary clinical impression of COPD exacerbation likely due to infection and the patient's agreement, which are included in the Gold Answer, representing minor discrepancies while keeping core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam and chest auscultation, vitals (including implied temperature), COVID swab, labs, disposition criteria (labs and vital signs), consultation with attending. Missed: explicit preliminary impression ('COPD exacerbation, maybe... infection') and patient agreement. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-43]: physical exam and chest listening ('physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest'), vitals, COVID swab ('covid swab'), labs and vitals for decision ('labs in your vital signs'), consultation ('talk to my attending'), and disposition ('stay in the ER and be admitted, or... good to go home'). No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured around the question, listing examinations/tests, consultations, criteria for ER admission vs. discharge, and outcome, with no off-topic content."
