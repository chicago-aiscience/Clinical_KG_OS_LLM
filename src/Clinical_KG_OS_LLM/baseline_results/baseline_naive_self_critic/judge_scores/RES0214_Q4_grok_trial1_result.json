  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53]. However, it inaccurately attributes the rationale for prioritizing COVID-19 primarily to the general symptoms of fever and sore throat, quoting the broad infectious rule-out statement, while the Gold Answer and transcript context emphasize the epidemiological factor of household transmission from the husband [P-19, D-53]. This introduces a factual discrepancy in the core rationale, though the prioritization statement is partially quoted correctly.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID swab ordered [D-53] - covered; (2) rationale centered on household transmission (husband's symptoms [P-19]) - missed; (3) specific quote tying to husband [D-53] - partially covered without context; (4) self-isolation instruction [D-53] - missed; (5) influenza as secondary possibility after no flu shot [P-53, D-54] - completely missed. Covers test (25%) and partial prioritization (25%), totaling ~50%.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: covid swab [D-53], symptoms of fever/sore throat (multiple patient responses), and both quoted phrases appear verbatim or nearly so in [D-53]. No hallucinations or inaccurate citations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address both parts of the question (test and rationale) with focused sections, no off-topic content, and uses transcript citations appropriately."
