  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis (bacterial pneumonia or bronchitis), which is consistent with the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly mention fevers, whereas the patient reports feeling 'hot at night' in [P-4]. It also includes references to an external 'Knowledge Graph' not present in the source.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses one of the three specific clinical features requested in the prompt: 'subjective fever'. Instead of explaining how subjective fever contributes to the diagnosis, it substitutes 'fatigue' and 'sleep disturbance'. It covers the productive cough and sputum color well.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant faithfulness error by claiming the transcript 'does not explicitly mention fevers' when the patient clearly describes subjective fevers in [P-4]. Furthermore, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' and specific links within it (e.g., 'yellow sputum') which are hallucinations relative to the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant as it addresses the diagnosis and the clinical evidence. However, it fails to follow the specific instruction to analyze 'subjective fever' as one of the three contributing factors, reducing its relevance to the specific prompt constraints."
