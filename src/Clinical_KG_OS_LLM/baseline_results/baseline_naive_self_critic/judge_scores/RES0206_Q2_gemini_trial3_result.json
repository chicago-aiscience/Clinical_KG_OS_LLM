  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the frequency of inhaler use is not mentioned, whereas the transcript explicitly states one is used daily and the other every two weeks (P-26). Furthermore, it fails to correctly identify why the patient is not on antihypertensive medication; the patient specifically mentions choosing lifestyle changes like weight loss and walking (P-23, P-24), which the generated answer ignores in favor of a vague statement about smoking cessation.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the distinction between maintenance and rescue inhalers, the specific frequencies for each, the lack of home oxygen, and the specific lifestyle modifications (weight loss and walking) for blood pressure management. It also misses details about alcohol use.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a 'hallucination of absence' by claiming the transcript does not contain the frequency of inhaler use. It also misinterprets the patient's management strategy for hypertension by failing to mention the specific lifestyle changes described in the text (P-24).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to address all parts of the prompt, but it fails to provide the actual information requested despite it being available in the source text."
