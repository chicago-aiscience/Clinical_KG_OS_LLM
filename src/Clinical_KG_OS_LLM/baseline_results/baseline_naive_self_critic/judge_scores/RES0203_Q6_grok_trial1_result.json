  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms as consistent with COVID-19 [D-39] and accurately describes the COVID test (swab method [D-39]), timeline ('one to two days' matching 'a day or two' [D-39]), and self-isolation instructions [D-39]. However, it incorrectly states there is no mention of consulting a supervising physician, directly contradicting [D-40] ('we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today'). It also adds unverified details like 'hypothesis of suspected COVID-19' and a 'knowledge graph linking symptoms,' which are not in the Gold Answer or transcript, and omits the assessment that the patient is otherwise well [D-16]. These are significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: symptoms consistent with COVID [D-39], COVID test via swab [D-39], self-isolation instructions [D-39], timeline [D-39]. Missed: patient otherwise generally well [D-16], mention of possible additional tests [D-40], plan to consult supervising physician with potential more questions [D-40], and reassurance [D-41]. Covers approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about test, method, timeline, and self-isolation are verifiable in [D-39]. However, denial of supervising physician consultation contradicts [D-40]. 'Hypothesis of suspected COVID-19' and 'knowledge graph' are hallucinated—not in transcript. Multiple unverifiable or fabricated elements present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around assessment and management plan, addressing core question elements like tests, self-care, timeline. Minor irrelevant additions like knowledge graph; misses some specified aspects (e.g., additional tests, consult) but remains mostly focused."
