  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with both the transcript and the gold answer. It accurately identifies the test (COVID swab), the turnaround time (24-48 hours), the isolation period (14 days), the alternative diagnosis (another viral illness), the possibility of false negatives, and the specific warning signs listed by the doctor.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers nearly all key points. It provides the specific warning signs with examples and the diagnostic/management details. It misses the specific mention of asthma as a hypothetical differential (mentioned in the gold answer) and the concluding summary that no medications were prescribed (watchful waiting), but it addresses all specific components requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the provided transcript. The citations [D-44] and [D-45] are used correctly and correspond to the appropriate sections of the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, specifically addressing each part of the multi-part question. It is organized into clear sections that make the information easy to digest."
