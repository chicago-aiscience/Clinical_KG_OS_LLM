  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the tick attachment duration reasoning, matching the Gold Answer's use of Friday hiking and Saturday gardening [P-1] leading to >72 hours per [D-6]. However, it incorrectly states there is no evidence of the doctor discussing the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map or using Strathroy's position, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [D-13], which explicitly mentions the map and deems Strathroy 'close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.' This is a significant factual contradiction on the second half of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: hiking Friday and gardening Saturday [P-1], doctor's >72-hour calculation [D-6]. Missed or incomplete: patient's uncertainty about attachment timing [P-1], doctor's note on time since last outdoors [D-2], full prophylactic rationale tied to duration [D-6], Strathroy location [P-12] (noted but dismissed), map reference, and 'concerning point' assessment [D-13] leading to antibiotics. Covers approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Duration claims are verifiable with accurate citations [P-1, D-6]. However, the assertion that the transcript 'do not contain evidence' of the Lyme map discussion is false and hallucinates the absence of [D-13], which directly references the 'Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario' and Strathroy's risk; mentions other elements like [P-3] but ignores the key map segment, introducing a major ungrounded claim.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address both parts of the question with clear headings, stays focused on the transcript details without tangents or off-topic content, despite factual errors."
