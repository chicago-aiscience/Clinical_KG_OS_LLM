  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely incorrect. It fails to mention any of the infectious screening symptoms (colds, loss of taste/smell, fevers, nausea, vomiting, belly pain) or the exposure history (sick contacts, travel) found in the transcript. It also incorrectly identifies the diagnostic test as 'increased usage of bronchodilator' (which is a treatment) instead of the 'COVID swab' explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost 100% of the key points. It does not list the specific symptoms screened for infection/COVID-19, the specific exposure questions, or the actual diagnostic test planned (COVID swab). It instead focuses on asthma triggers like cold air, pollen, and exercise.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination by stating that the infectious screening was 'not captured in the transcript' when it is clearly detailed in segments D-21 through D-28. While it correctly identifies asthma triggers from the text, its claim about the absence of infectious screening is false.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely off-topic. The question specifically asks for symptoms and history screened to 'rule out an infectious cause (including COVID-19)'. The Generated Answer provides information about asthma triggers and management, which does not address the infectious/COVID focus of the prompt."
