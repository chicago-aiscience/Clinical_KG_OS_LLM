{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the management plan in [D-52]: COVID swab, isolate 14 days, contact tracing only if positive, and supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). It also correctly notes the possibility of another viral illness if not COVID. No clinically meaningful contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: COVID-19 swab ordered; 14-day isolation; contact tracing if positive; supportive care elements (hydrate, nutritious food, sleep, antipyretics/Tylenol for fever, Tylenol or NSAIDs for aches); supportive management regardless of COVID vs other viral illness. Key point missed vs Gold Answer: expected test result timeframe (24–48 hours).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by [D-52]. However, the references to a 'Knowledge Graph' confirming swab/contact tracing are not part of the transcript and are therefore unverifiable additions (though they do not change the clinical content).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question components (test, isolation duration, when contact tracing occurs, and supportive care recommendations) with no substantive tangents."
