  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error. It states the patient had 'complete loss' of taste, but the transcript and Gold Answer clearly show the loss was PARTIAL - the patient could still taste 'really, really salty foods' [P-4]. The smell loss is correctly identified as partial. The cough description is accurate but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only basic information and misses many key details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the 2-day duration, (2) specific examples of what could still be perceived (very strong bad smells, very salty foods, unable to taste banana), (3) the consistent rather than intermittent nature of symptoms, (4) that the cough was non-productive with no sputum or blood, (5) that cough remained consistent without worsening, (6) that all symptoms started simultaneously, and (7) no identified triggers. Coverage is approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations to [P-1], but makes one critical error by characterizing taste loss as 'complete' when [P-4] clearly states the patient could still taste very salty foods. This represents a misinterpretation of available evidence rather than pure fabrication, but is still a faithfulness issue.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about specific sensory and respiratory symptoms and their degree of presentation. All content is relevant to the question, though it lacks the depth and detail requested in the prompt asking for 'what they could and could not still perceive.'"

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the core question about sensory and respiratory symptoms but has significant deficiencies. It contains a major factual error by stating taste loss was 'complete' when it was actually partial (patient could taste very salty foods). The answer misses critical details about the specific perceptions retained (strong bad smells, very salty foods, inability to taste banana), the 2-day duration, consistency of symptoms, non-productive nature of cough, simultaneous onset, and absence of triggers. While relevant and mostly grounded in the transcript, the completeness (~35% coverage) and the correctness error significantly limit its quality."
