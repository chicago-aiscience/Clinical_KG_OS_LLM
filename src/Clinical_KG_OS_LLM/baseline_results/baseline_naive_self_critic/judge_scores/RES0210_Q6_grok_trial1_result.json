  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that there are no Doctor statements in the transcript (only Patient turns), directly contradicting the transcript which has numerous [D-1] to [D-44] turns, including the key [D-43] plan to consult the supervising physician and return. It misses or misattributes key facts: omits expectoration as self-care relief [P-13]; misinterprets sore throat after coughing [P-15] as aggravating chest pain (actual chest pain worsening is [P-19]); dismisses deep breathing as non-explicit despite clear [P-18] and [P-19]; introduces 'knowledge graph' not present anywhere. Core facts like Tylenol partial relief [P-14] and exertion [P-10,11] are correct, but significant contradictions exist. Score: 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Doctor plan [D-43] (100% missed); self-care (Tylenol [P-14] covered, misses expectoration [P-13] and 'taking it easy' explicitly as measure [P-10] -- ~33% covered); aggravating (covers exertion [P-10,11], partial coughing via [P-15] misinterp, misses deep breathing [P-18,19] and explicit no others [P-12] -- ~40% covered); alleviating (covers Tylenol and rest [P-10], misses expectoration [P-13] -- ~50% covered). Overall ~30-40% coverage. Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Major fabrication: claims 'no statements or turns attributed to the Doctor' despite full transcript with D turns and citations like [D-43]; invents 'knowledge graph' connections not in transcript (e.g., exertion exacerbates chest pain explicitly linked, Tylenol relieves cough); mis-cites [P-15] for chest pain (it's sore throat); overlooks verifiable [P-18,19] for deep breathing/chest pain, [P-13] for expectoration. Multiple hallucinated elements and inaccurate citations. Score: 1.",
    "relevance": "Answer is structured directly around the question's components (Doctor's plan, self-care, aggravating, alleviating factors), uses transcript citations where applicable, and ties to clinical management implicitly; extraneous 'knowledge graph' is minor tangent but content stays on-topic. Score: 4"
