  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies smoking as the primary risk factor for COPD with accurate citation [P-40], aligning with Gold. However, it omits details like quitting at diagnosis [P-7, P-40] and persistent damage requiring inhalers [P-26]. In the chain, it accurately cites exposure [P-20], symptoms [P-1, P-9], and doctor [D-43], but introduces unsubstantiated COVID-19 specificity via hallucinated Knowledge Graph, whereas Gold attributes to a general 'infection'. Some factual errors from additions, but core points match.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: smoking primary risk [P-40], quit at diagnosis [P-7,P-40], persistent COPD/inhalers [P-26]; chain: dog walks/friend sick/too close [P-20], infection symptoms (green sputum [P-1], sinus [P-12], headache [P-14], fever [P-9]), patient suggestion [P-23], past pattern [P-3], doctor [D-43]. Generated covers smoking [P-40], exposure [P-20], partial symptoms [P-1,P-9], doctor [D-43]; misses quit timing, inhalers, sinus/headache, [P-23], [P-3]. Covers ~60% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like Knowledge Graph links (e.g., smoking->COPD, sick friend->COVID, symptoms->exacerbation) are not verifiable in transcript—pure hallucination. Citations [P-20,P-40,P-1,P-9,D-43] accurate, but COVID emphasis extrapolates beyond transcript's 'rule out COVID' [D-43]. Multiple hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses both question parts (smoking-COPD relation, sick contact chain to exacerbation) with structured response; no off-topic content."
