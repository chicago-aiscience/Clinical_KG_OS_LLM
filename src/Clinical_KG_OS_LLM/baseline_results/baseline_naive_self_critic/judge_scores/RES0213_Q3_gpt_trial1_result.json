  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer’s diagnosis is **anxiety-related/stress-induced chest pain**. The Generated Answer instead concludes **Conversion Disorder / Psychogenic Pain Disorder**, which is not the diagnosis supported by the Gold Answer and is not well-supported by the transcript. While the transcript does support a psychological/stress association, it specifically aligns with anxiety/stress-related chest pain (and anxiety/panic physiology), not conversion disorder. The Generated Answer also introduces incorrect/unsupported interpretations (e.g., symptoms as a “displaced expression of conflict” and “to gain attention”).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points **covered** (partially):\n- Mentions history of anxiety attacks as a teen (P-21) and current academic stress (P-13).\n- Notes fear about dad’s heart attack and possible stress link (P-8).\n- Mentions contextual/social modulation of symptoms (though it does not clearly anchor the core quotes P-9/P-29 as well as the Gold Answer).\n\nKey Gold Answer points **missed**:\n- The central situational pattern with explicit quotes: occurs when alone with thoughts; resolves with distraction/people/tasks (P-4, P-9, P-29) is not fully or cleanly articulated.\n- Anxiety-physiology during episodes: “makes herself nervous,” “starts breathing faster,” difficulty taking a deep breath due to nervousness (P-19).\n- Pertinent negatives favoring non-cardiopulmonary causes: no fever (P-12), no exertional worsening (P-10), occurs at rest (D-11/P-11), no palpitations outside anxiety episodes (P-20), no asthma (P-23/24).\n\nOverall, it captures some stress/anxiety context but omits several major supporting observations and negatives emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are **not grounded** in the transcript:\n- References to a “knowledge graph” are not present in the source.\n- Claims about conversion symptoms serving as a displaced conflict/attention mechanism are not stated or implied.\n- The statement that lack of response to Tylenol/Advil/Alka-Seltzer “reinforces the organic nature is likely ruled out” is an overreach; nonresponse to OTC meds does not rule out organic etiologies.\n\nSome cited items (anxiety history, stress, family heart history, tried OTC meds) are grounded, but the interpretation contains several hallucinated/unsupported assertions.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to answer the question by providing a diagnosis and citing consultation observations, and it remains largely on-topic. However, it uses the wrong diagnosis and adds interpretive tangents (attention/conflict) that are not asked for and not supported, reducing practical relevance."

  "summary": "The answer is on-topic but gives an incorrect primary diagnosis (conversion disorder instead of anxiety/stress-related chest pain) and includes several unsupported interpretations, while also missing multiple key supporting observations and pertinent negatives from the Gold Answer."
