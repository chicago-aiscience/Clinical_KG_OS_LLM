    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and misinterpretations. It incorrectly states that the patient 'denied' the relationship between seizure and symptoms, when the patient actually said they didn't know if it was related. More critically, it completely misses the systematic screening of multiple negative findings that the Gold Answer comprehensively documents: chest pain, feeling faint, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, and diarrhea. The Generated Answer only mentions shortness of breath and cough, which were the presenting complaints, not denied symptoms. It fundamentally misunderstands what the question is asking about.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the vast majority of the negative screening questions documented in the Gold Answer: chest pain (cardiac), feeling faint (cardiopulmonary), loss of taste/smell (infectious), sore throat (upper respiratory), runny nose (upper respiratory), sick contacts (epidemiological), travel history (epidemiological), nausea/vomiting (GI), belly pain (GI), diarrhea (GI), and sputum production. It only vaguely references cardiac and infectious differentials without explaining the specific negative findings that help rule them out.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains statements that misrepresent the transcript. It states the patient 'denied the relationship between the seizure and symptoms,' but the patient actually said 'I don't know if that's related' [P-8], which is uncertainty, not denial. The core claim that the doctor screened for symptoms that the patient denied is not properly supported - the answer confuses presenting symptoms with screening questions for negative findings. However, the references to the seizure, missed medication, and dry cough are accurately cited from the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer significantly misses the point of the question. The question asks about 'symptoms and exposures that the patient DENIED' and how these 'negative findings' address differential diagnoses. The Generated Answer instead focuses on the presenting symptoms (shortness of breath and cough) that the patient confirmed, not denied. While it attempts to address differential diagnoses, it only provides superficial mentions of cardiac and infectious categories without explaining how the negative findings help narrow the differential, which is central to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misunderstands the question by focusing on confirmed presenting symptoms rather than the extensive list of denied symptoms and exposures that the doctor systematically screened for. It misses nearly all the negative findings documented in the Gold Answer (chest pain, feeling faint, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, GI symptoms) that help narrow differential diagnoses across cardiac, infectious, and gastrointestinal categories. The answer contains factual errors about what the patient denied and provides minimal, superficial coverage of how these findings relate to differential diagnoses. It demonstrates poor comprehension of the clinical screening process and the significance of negative findings in diagnostic reasoning."
