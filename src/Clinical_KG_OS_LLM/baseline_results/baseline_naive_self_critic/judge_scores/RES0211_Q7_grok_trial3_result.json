  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly state the chronological order of symptoms, despite [P-4] clearly indicating 'I first noticed that my throat was kind of scratchy and then I started coughing.' It also wrongly claims no mention of feeling hot, contradicting [P-7] 'I have felt really hot' and [P-9] describing it as constant day and night. It misses other symptoms like headache, malaise, and fatigue, and the overall progression, leading to significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 3-4 days duration (covered), initial scratchy throat then dry cough (missed), headache/malaise/fatigue (missed), persistent hot feeling all time with no exact onset timing but part of same illness (missed entirely), progression from local to systemic (missed). Only covers duration and existence of cough/throat vaguely, <20% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims unverifiable: no explicit order (falsely denies [P-4]), no mention of hot/fever (falsely denies [P-7,P-9]); other claims like [P-1] accurate but major denials are hallucinations of absence; not grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly focuses on the symptom timeline, order of cough/throat, and hot sensation relation, with no irrelevant content or tangents, perfectly matching the question."
