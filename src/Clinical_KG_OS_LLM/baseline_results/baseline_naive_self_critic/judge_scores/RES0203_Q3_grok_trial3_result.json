  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (loss of taste, smell, and mild dry cough) from P-1, correctly quotes the doctor's connection to COVID-19 symptoms from D-39, and specifies the swab test from D-39. All facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and transcript, with no errors or contradictions, though it omits some supportive details like patient-initiated concern and rule-outs.",
    "completeness": "Covered: the exact combination of three symptoms, doctor's explicit connection via D-39 quote, and specific test method (swab). Missed: patient's initial COVID worry (P-1), systematic confirmation of absent symptoms (e.g., fever P-10, dyspnea P-11), 'pretty well' summary (D-16), and emphasis on narrow profile supporting testing/self-isolation. Covers core ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: symptoms from P-1, doctor's statement and test from D-39. Citations are accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question, detailing the symptom combination, diagnostic connection, and test method with no off-topic content."
