  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (cough, sputum, fever, sinus pressure) and the doctor's assessment. However, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which does not exist in the provided source material. It also conflates sinus pressure with a 'stuffy nose', which the patient did not explicitly confirm in the transcript (P-12).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the patient's increased dyspnea (shortness of breath) and decreased exercise tolerance (walking the dog), which are critical indicators of COPD exacerbation. It also omits the exclusion of environmental triggers (dust/smoke) and the confirmation of medication adherence, which the Gold Answer uses to strengthen the dual diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer significantly fails on faithfulness by repeatedly citing a 'Knowledge Graph' to justify its clinical associations. No such graph was provided in the prompt; the evaluation should be based strictly on the transcript. This constitutes a hallucination of the source evidence.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses both parts of the question, identifying supporting symptoms and explaining the role of specific findings in the diagnosis, even though the evidence used for the explanation is external to the transcript."
