  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All items listed in the Generated Answer match what the doctor stated in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring with supplemental oxygen as needed, continuation of bronchodilators, plus new steroids and antibiotics, and a COVID swab. No contradictions with the Gold Answer were introduced. The only issue is omission of an additional monitoring point (blood pressure monitoring) mentioned elsewhere ([D-37]), not an incorrect statement.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core COPD exacerbation plan from [D-52]: labs (CBC/electrolytes/kidney function/ABG), imaging (CXR), monitoring (O2 sat), and therapies (supplemental O2 PRN, steroids, antibiotics, continue bronchodilators) and COVID swab. Misses: (1) the additional plan to keep checking blood pressure mentioned in [D-37] (included in the Gold Answer as an additional monitoring consideration); (2) the stated COVID result timeframe (24–48 hours) from [D-52]. Overall captures most key points but not all.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements are grounded in the transcript: all listed tests/interventions are explicitly mentioned in [D-52], and the bronchodilator examples (Ventolin/Spiriva) are supported by [P-11]. No clear hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing laboratory tests, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions for the COPD exacerbation. No meaningful tangents."
