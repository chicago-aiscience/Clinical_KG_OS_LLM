  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts from the Gold Answer and transcript where stated, with no contradictions or errors in the core management plan details (diagnostic swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, supportive care items). Minor omission of the '24-48 hours' results timeline does not introduce inaccuracy, and the Knowledge Graph notes, while extraneous, do not misstate facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic swab (partial, misses results timeline), 14-day self-isolation, contact tracing if positive, alternative viral illness mention, all supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Missed: explicit '24-48 hours' results expectation and 'no prescription medications beyond supportive' phrasing. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims are directly verifiable in [D-52] with accurate citations. Knowledge Graph references ('confirms a swab... [PROCEDURE] covid' and contact tracing) are not in the transcript, introducing minor unverifiable details that are plausible but not grounded, resembling minor hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured around the question's elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), directly addressing the complete management plan with no off-topic content beyond brief KG notes."
