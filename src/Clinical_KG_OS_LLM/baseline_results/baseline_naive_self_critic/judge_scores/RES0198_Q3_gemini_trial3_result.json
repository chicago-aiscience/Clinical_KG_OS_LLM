  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the patient's symptoms (stuffy/runny nose) and the doctor's diagnosis. It mentions the 'on and off' nature of the stuffiness as stated in [P-1], though it misses the later clarification in [P-8] where the patient describes the overall symptoms as 'pretty constant.' It accurately reflects the doctor's treatment plan.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly less complete than the Gold Answer. It misses the specific evidence used to rule out allergic causes (no history of allergies, no exposure to dust/animals/fumes) and bacterial causes (clear discharge, lack of fever or headache). It also fails to mention the absence of other symptoms like cough or sore throat and the potential viral exposure via the nephew in daycare.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript and does not hallucinate information. All claims about the symptoms, the doctor's statements, and the recommended treatment are supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is partially relevant. While it explains why the doctor thought it was a viral infection, it barely addresses the 'rather than an allergic or bacterial cause' part of the question. It lacks the comparative evidence (e.g., lack of fever, clear discharge, no allergy history) required by the prompt."
