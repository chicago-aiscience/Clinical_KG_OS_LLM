  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is entirely consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It accurately identifies the COVID swab as the test, the 24-48 hour turnaround, the 14-day isolation period, and the specific warning signs (high temperature, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting). It also correctly notes the possibility of false negatives and the alternative diagnosis of 'another viral illness' if the test is negative.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all components requested in the multi-part question. It includes the assessment (infection/COVID-compatible), management plan (isolation, test), turnaround time, false negative discussion, alternative diagnosis (viral illness), and the specific examples of warning signs for an ER visit. While it omits the doctor's brief hypothetical mention of asthma (which the Gold Answer includes), the generated answer strictly follows the prompt's request for the alternative diagnosis *if the test returns negative*, which the doctor specified as another viral illness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the provided transcript and include correct speaker citations (e.g., D-44, D-45). There is no hallucination of outside medical knowledge or medications not mentioned in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address each point of the complex question using clear headers."
