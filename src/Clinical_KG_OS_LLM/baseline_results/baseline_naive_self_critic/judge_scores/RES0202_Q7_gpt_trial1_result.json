  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately matches the Gold Answer’s timeline: cough began Wednesday evening and was dry; cough worsened Thursday with notable tiredness; by Friday the cough worsened further and fever (>100°F) appeared, along with decreased appetite and possible loss of taste. No contradictory or incorrect clinical details were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) cough first appeared Wednesday night and was dry, (2) cough worsened over Thurs and Fri, (3) fever emerged on Friday and was >100°F, (4) decreased appetite and possible taste change on Friday. Key points missed: (a) mild runny nose on Friday, (b) fatigue as an additional/systemic symptom on Friday (the answer notes tiredness on Thursday only), (c) explicit note that the parent corrected the physician from “five days” to “three days,” and (d) the parent’s stepwise summary in P-12 (partially implied but not explicitly included). Overall coverage is strong but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are grounded in the transcript (P-1 for onset/worsening and fever; P-17 for breakfast/taste concern). No clear hallucinations or unsupported symptoms are added; omissions exist but do not reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question’s requested day-by-day evolution (onset of cough, change in severity over three days, emergence of fever and new symptoms). It stays focused and avoids tangents."
