  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main symptoms (cough, sputum color, fever, sinus pressure). However, it attributes findings to a 'Knowledge Graph' which does not exist in the provided context. It also makes slightly contradictory statements about how findings distinguish the diagnoses, eventually concluding they both support a COPD exacerbation triggered by infection, which aligns with the Gold Answer's core logic but is explained less clearly.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, including: increased dyspnea (shortness of breath), increased sputum volume, decreased exercise tolerance (difficulty walking the dog), headache, and the exclusion of other triggers like environmental exposures (smoke/dust) or medication non-adherence. It focuses on a subset of symptoms rather than the full clinical picture provided in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer repeatedly refers to a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source of information (e.g., regarding stuffy nose associations and diagnostic links). No such graph was provided in the prompt or transcript. While the clinical symptoms themselves are found in the transcript, the attribution to this external 'Knowledge Graph' is a hallucination of the context structure.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question asked, addressing both the symptoms supporting the dual assessment and the specific role of sputum color and fever in the diagnosis."
