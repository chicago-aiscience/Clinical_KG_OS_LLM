  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript contains only patient responses (P-1 to P-39) with no clinician dialogue, directly contradicting the full transcript which includes extensive clinician statements (D-1 to D-44). It denies evidence for the COVID swab (present in D-29), medication change suggestion (D-43), and consultation with supervising physician (D-29, D-43), making it factually inaccurate compared to the Gold Answer's accurate summary of these points.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: 1) COVID swab diagnostic test (D-29); 2) medication regimen change suggestion (D-43, addressing lack of controller med); 3) next steps with supervising physician consultation (D-29, D-43). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead summarizing patient symptoms, triggers, and history, which are not part of the clinician's plan.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript lacks clinician dialogue and mentions a non-existent 'knowledge graph'; misinterprets goldfish as a trigger (P-39 notes goldfish but not as trigger); all claims about absence of plan elements are unverifiable and contradicted by transcript (e.g., D-29 explicitly mentions COVID swab, D-43 mentions med change and consulting doctor).",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks for the clinician's overall plan, including COVID test, med change, and physician consultation; Generated Answer dismisses this as impossible due to fabricated transcript limitations and pivots to patient history summary, making it largely off-topic."
