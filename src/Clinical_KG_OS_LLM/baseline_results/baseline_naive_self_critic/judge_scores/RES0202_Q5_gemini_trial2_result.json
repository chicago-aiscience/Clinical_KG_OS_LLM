  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It states the child developed symptoms after returning home on Thursday, whereas the transcript [P-1] specifies he came home Wednesday and the cough started that night. More importantly, it claims the transcript lacks information on school notifications, but [P-39] explicitly states, 'But they haven't. They haven't like contacted us about anything.'",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it doesn't mention the mother's specific concern about COVID [P-2], the definitive 'no sick contacts' outside of school [P-38], or the school's requirement for a COVID test to notify other families [P-41].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails faithfulness by stating that information regarding school notifications is missing, which is a hallucination of omission given the clear statement in [P-39]. It also misrepresents the timeline of symptoms found in [P-1].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it attempts to address all parts of the multi-part question, although the information provided is factually incorrect."
