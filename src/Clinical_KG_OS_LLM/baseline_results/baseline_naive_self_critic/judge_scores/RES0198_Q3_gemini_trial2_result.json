  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the doctor's conclusion (viral infection/common cold) and mentions the primary symptoms (stuffy/runny nose) and duration. However, it fails to explain the specific evidence that ruled out bacterial or allergic causes, which was a key part of the question.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several critical pieces of evidence from the gold answer: (1) clear discharge quality vs. colored discharge, (2) the absence of systemic features like fever, headache, or sore throat (ruling out bacterial infection), (3) the lack of environmental exposures like dust or animals and the absence of prior allergy history (ruling out allergic causes), and (4) the potential viral exposure via the nephew in daycare.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the transcript. The mention of a 'knowledge graph' is not supported by the prompt context but does not lead to an inaccurate clinical claim in this specific output.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but fails to fully address the 'rather than' portion of the prompt, which required identifying the specific evidence used to differentiate the viral infection from other causes."
