  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims there is 'no clinical information' regarding a runny nose, which is explicitly discussed in transcript turns P-11, P-12, and P-24. Furthermore, it suggests symptoms may have 'worsened,' whereas the patient explicitly stated the cough had 'kind of stayed the same' (P-7). It also claims the transcript uses 'general terms' for the cough, whereas the transcript specifically uses the term 'dry cough' (D-5, P-5, P-24).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1. The relative timing (runny nose starting 2-3 days after the cough). 2. The specific comparison that the patient never had a dry cough like this before. 3. The fact that prior runny noses never lasted this long. While it mentions asthma and fever history, these are secondary to the primary symptom progression requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of information regarding the runny nose. It also inaccurately interprets the severity of the cough by adding 'worsened' when the transcript says it 'stayed the same.' It references a 'clinical knowledge graph' not present in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to follow the structure of the prompt but fails to provide the specific details requested (relative timing, specific prior experience comparisons) due to its failure to identify relevant information in the transcript."
