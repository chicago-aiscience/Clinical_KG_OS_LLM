  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately lists stuffy nose (initially on/off), runny nose for one week, progression from stuffy to mostly running [P-1-P-3], clear nasal discharge [P-5], and explicit denials of cough [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills [P-7], loss of taste/smell [P-16]. Generated Answer partially matches nasal symptoms but inaccurately states runny nose was 'mostly run since the beginning' (contradicts P-3's 'stuffy at first'), completely omits 'clear' discharge (key fact from P-5), and falsely claims no explicit denials for cough/sore throat/etc. despite direct 'No' responses in P-4, P-7, P-16; significant errors and contradictions warrant score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: nasal symptoms (stuffy/runny, duration, progression), clear discharge, denials (cough, post-nasal, sore throat/SOB/fever/chills, taste/smell), fatigue/other negatives. Generated covers stuffy/runny nose and partial progression (~40% of nasal points), misses clear discharge entirely, covers only post-nasal denial partially and wrongly denies others exist (covers ~1/5 denials); overall ~25-30% coverage, score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated citations [P-1, P-3, P-10] are accurate for nasal claims, but misinterprets P-3 progression ('mostly run since beginning' vs. 'stuffy first, now running'), omits P-5 clear discharge, and incorrectly asserts 'no explicit verbal denials' for cough [P-4 'No'], sore throat/etc. [P-7 'No'], taste/smell [P-16 'No']—these are direct transcript quotes; multiple unverifiable/misstated claims about absences constitute hallucination/misrepresentation, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly around the question with sections on nasal symptoms, discharge character, and denied symptoms, using transcript citations; no off-topic content, perfectly focused despite inaccuracies, score 5."
