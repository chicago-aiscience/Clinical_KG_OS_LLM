  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript where stated: correctly identifies onset symptoms (SOB, fatigue, weakness, reduced appetite), subjective fever yesterday, loss of taste morning, and emerging cough/sore throat sensations with accurate citations. No contradictions or errors; minor interpretive phrasing like 'emerged overnight' for taste aligns with 'this morning,' and 'dry throat pre-cough' reasonably links P-8/P-9 descriptions without inaccuracy. Body aches, smell, and headaches omissions affect completeness, not correctness here.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: onset SOB [P-1,P-3], fatigue/rundown/tired [P-1], weakness [P-2], reduced appetite [P-2]; fever yesterday [P-4]; loss of taste morning [P-4]; emerging cough [P-7,P-8] and sore throat-ish [P-9]. Missed: body aches/achy [P-20,P-21] in onset, loss of smell [P-6] in morning, headaches [P-11,P-12] in emerging, wife's forehead confirmation, 'new for him' [P-5], laborious breathing detail (mentioned but not emphasized). Covers ~80% of key symptoms and timeline structure.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., SOB [P-1,P-3], fever [P-4], taste [P-4], cough/throat [P-8,P-9]). No hallucinations; interpretations like 'dry throat sensation' from 'feels dry like it's on its way' [P-8] and linking to sore throat [P-9] are plausible and grounded. No fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response into onset, recent (yesterday-morning), and emerging phases mirroring the question's timeline request (onset couple days ago, fever day before/taste morning, just emerging at consult). No off-topic content; directly reconstructs timeline."
