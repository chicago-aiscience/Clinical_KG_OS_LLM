  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the patient did not identify a specific potential exposure event. In the transcript (P-18), the patient specifically identifies a hiking trip two weeks prior where people brushed by them as the only possible source of exposure. The Gold Answer correctly captures this event.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to mention the hiking trip, the timeframe (two weeks ago), or the contact with people brushing by them. It misses nearly all key points found in the Gold Answer regarding the specific exposure event requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims that no exposure event was mentioned in the consultation, which is a direct contradiction of the transcript text in P-18. This is a significant hallucination of omission/negation.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the question, it provides a negative response ('did not explicitly identify') that is factually wrong based on the source text, thereby failing to provide the specific information requested."
