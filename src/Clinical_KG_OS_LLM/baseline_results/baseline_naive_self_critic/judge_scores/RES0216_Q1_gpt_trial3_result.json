  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several present symptoms (chest tightness with inspiration, difficulty getting a full breath, hoarseness, increased phlegm/throat clearing) and correctly lists denials of chest pain and cough. However, it contains a major factual error by stating that the transcript does not contain explicit denials of fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating—these are explicitly denied in P-6 and P-12 through P-15. This directly contradicts both the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Present symptoms: partially covered (chest tightness and dyspnea; hoarseness/phlegm/throat clearing) but misses key qualifiers from the Gold Answer (diffuse/all-over location; constant baseline with worsening on exertion/walking, deep breaths, and getting up from a chair). Denials: substantially incomplete—omits explicit denials of fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, sweating, and impending doom. Overall coverage is well below the Gold Answer’s set of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most symptom statements are grounded in cited transcript lines. However, the note claiming the transcript lacks explicit denials for fevers/night sweats/chills/weight loss/anxiety/sweating is not just unverifiable—it is contradicted by P-6 and P-12 to P-15. This constitutes a significant unfaithful claim relative to the source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the asked symptom inventory (present vs denied respiratory/upper airway/chest-related symptoms). Minor extraneous wording (“knowledge graph provided”) does not substantially detract, but the incorrect note about absent denials impacts usefulness more than relevance."
