  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly asserts that the transcript segments do not contain information on the patient's contact with his grandson (including daycare and cold symptoms), recent travel, or in-person client visits, despite these being explicitly present in [P-23], [D-24/P-24], and [P-31/P-32/D-32]. It fails to connect the grandson exposure to the timing of symptoms [P-1] and the doctor's assessment of infection [D-36], directly contradicting the Gold Answer's factual summary. No accurate coverage of excluded pathways or their role in assessment. Score: 1.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer missed entirely: grandson visit last weekend with cold from daycare [P-23]; symptom onset 'couple days' after [P-1]; doctor acknowledgment [D-24]; exclusion of travel outside province [D-24/P-24]; work mostly from home, no client visits in past week [P-31/P-32/D-32]; grandson as primary potential source supporting infection assessment [D-36]. Generated covers 0% of these, focusing instead on symptoms irrelevant to the exposure question. Score: 1.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about absence of exposure details in 'transcript segments ([D-36] through [P-9])' are false, as relevant info appears earlier (e.g., [P-23]); full transcript provided contradicts this. Introduces unsupported 'knowledge graph [KG]' not in source. Hallucinates lack of grounding where evidence exists; largely fabricated denial. Score: 1.",
    "relevance": "Partially notes doctor's infection assessment [D-36] and symptoms, but core question on grandson exposure connection and excluded pathways (travel/clients) is dismissed as unestablishable due to fabricated transcript gaps, rendering it largely off-topic. Score: 2"
