  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript and Gold Answer: hiking Friday and gardening Saturday; patient unsure when tick attached and hoped it was from hiking; discovered it “earlier today,” removed it, and brought it in a plastic container; clinician estimated possible attachment >72 hours; prior episode ~10 years ago involved a bullseye/target rash and antibiotics; prior tick was quite swollen vs current only mildly (if at all) engorged; current symptoms are localized redness/tenderness without a bullseye rash. No contradictions or clear factual errors relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: Friday hiking + Saturday gardening; uncertainty of exposure source; discovery due to soreness behind left knee; removal and bringing tick in container; clinician’s >72h estimate; prior bullseye rash and antibiotics; current localized redness/tenderness without larger circle rash; prior tick more engorged.\nKey points missed/minimized: did not specify hiking location (Strathroy); did not explicitly include that the current tick was described as “pretty small” [P-4] nor the clinician’s “little grape” comparison regarding engorgement [D-4]. Overall ~80–90% of Gold Answer content is included.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are well grounded in cited transcript segments. No notable hallucinations or added clinical details beyond the transcript. Minor omission of Strathroy is an omission, not an ungrounded addition.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by summarizing the exposure timeline and comparing current vs prior tick-bite symptoms/engorgement; no significant tangents."
