  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition and mentions the lack of symptoms during physical activity (shortness of breath and wheezing). However, it contains a significant factual error by claiming that the absence of fever and chills was used by the mother to rule out asthma; in the transcript, these were discussed in the context of the current illness (P-13), not the asthma workup. Additionally, it incorrectly cites P-13 for the grandparents' asthma history, which actually appears in P-28.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details provided in the Gold Answer: it fails to mention that the patient had already been 'worked up' for asthma previously, and it omits the patient's own statement about being 'pretty healthy' and never having this specific type of cough before, which helped distinguish the current condition from asthma.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a logical link between the absence of fever/chills and the ruling out of asthma. It also provides an incorrect citation for the grandparents' medical history (citing P-13 instead of P-28).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the components of the question, although it includes incorrect supporting evidence."
