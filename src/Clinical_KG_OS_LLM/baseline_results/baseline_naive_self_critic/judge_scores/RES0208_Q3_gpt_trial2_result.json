  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: general infection evidence = fevers + fatigue + muscle aches; COVID-not-ruled-out features = difficulty breathing + emerging sore throat + (developing) cough. Generated answer correctly identifies fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches as systemic infectious symptoms, and correctly names sore throat and cough as COVID-concerning symptoms. However, it misclassifies “difficulty breathing” as part of the evidence for a general infectious process (Gold treats it as part of the respiratory/COVID-concern layer) and it omits difficulty breathing from the COVID-not-ruled-out set. This is a meaningful category error plus an omission.",
    "completeness": "Covered: fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (systemic infectious evidence); sore throat and cough (COVID concern). Missed: explicitly including difficulty breathing as part of why COVID could not be ruled out. Also missed the Gold’s explicit nuance that loss of taste/smell were elicited but not cited in the doctor’s assessment summary (not strictly required by the question, but part of the Gold answer’s key clarification). Overall ~60–75% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms mentioned in the Generated Answer appear in the transcript, especially in D-36 (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough). The main issue is interpretive grouping rather than inventing facts; no clear hallucinations. Minor unfaithfulness insofar as it attributes difficulty breathing to the ‘general infectious process’ evidence rather than to the COVID-concern set emphasized in Gold.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question with no substantive tangents."

  "summary": "The answer is largely transcript-grounded and relevant, but it incompletely and somewhat incorrectly separates which symptoms supported a general infection versus which prevented ruling out COVID (notably omitting dyspnea from the COVID-concern group and misgrouping it under general infection)."
