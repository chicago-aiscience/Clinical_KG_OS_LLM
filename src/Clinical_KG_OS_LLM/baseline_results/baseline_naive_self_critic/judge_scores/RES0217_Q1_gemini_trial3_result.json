  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not indicate the doctor screened for headaches. In reality, the doctor explicitly asks 'So no headaches?' at [D-19] and the patient denies them at [P-19]. The gold answer correctly includes this. Other local and systemic symptoms provided match the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the patient's specific denial of the 'bullseye' or 'target' rash, which is a key pertinent negative found in the gold answer. It also fails to include the screening for headaches, which was specifically requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a false claim regarding the transcript's content (stating headaches were not screened), which is a failure of faithfulness to the source text where [D-19] clearly shows the screening occurred.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing the local and systemic categories requested, though its content is flawed regarding the specific symptoms requested (headaches)."
