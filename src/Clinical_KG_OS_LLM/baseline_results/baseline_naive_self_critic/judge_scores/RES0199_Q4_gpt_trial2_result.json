  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, the ordered diagnostic test as a swab, the expected turnaround time as 24–48 hours, and the alternative diagnosis (another viral illness) if the test is negative. These match the Gold Answer and are consistent with [D-52]. No factual contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "Included Gold key points: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) swab test, (3) results in 24–48 hours, (4) alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative. \nMissed Gold key points: instruction to isolate for 14 days, mention that public health would contact the patient for contact tracing if positive, and note that management is supportive either way. Overall, it captures the core asked elements but not all details included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically [D-52]. No extraneous or hallucinated clinical details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on what the question asks: the ruled-out condition, the specific test and its turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis if negative. No irrelevant information is included."
