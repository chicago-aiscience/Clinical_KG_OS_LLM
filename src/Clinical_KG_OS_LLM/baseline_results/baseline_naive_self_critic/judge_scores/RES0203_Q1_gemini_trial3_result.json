  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer identifies the three main symptoms (smell, taste, cough) but incorrectly characterizes the loss of taste as 'complete'. According to the transcript and the gold answer, the loss of taste was partial, as the patient could still perceive 'really, really salty foods'. It also misses the clarification that the smell loss was partial because the patient could still detect very bad odors.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to address the specific sub-instruction to 'Include any details the patient provided about what they could and could not still perceive' (e.g., salty foods, bananas, bad smells). It also omits the duration (two days), the consistency of the symptoms, and clinical details about the cough (non-productive, no triggers). It covers less than 50% of the key information provided in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is grounded in the initial statement made by the patient in [P-1]. However, by ignoring the later clarification in [P-4], it presents an inaccurate picture of the patient's condition. There are no hallucinations, but the reliance on only one part of the transcript leads to inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question asked, though it lacks the depth and specific detail required by the prompt."
