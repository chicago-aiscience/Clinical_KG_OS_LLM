  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains major factual errors. It incorrectly claims that the transcript lacks doctor statements (D-1 through D-44 are present), leading it to state no plan was provided. It also incorrectly claims deep breathing was not explicitly named as a trigger, contradicting turn [P-18].",
    "completeness": "The answer is highly incomplete. It misses the doctor's stated plan entirely. It also fails to mention that 'bringing up gunk' (expectoration) was a self-care measure and an alleviating factor identified in the gold answer [P-13].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source text. It hallucinates that the transcript excerpts contain statements 'exclusively from the Patient' and lack doctor turns. It also ignores the explicit mention of deep breathing as an aggravating factor in [P-18].",
    "relevance": "While the generated answer attempts to follow the structure of the prompt by using headers for the plan, self-care, and factors, the content within those sections is largely based on a false premise about the transcript's contents."
