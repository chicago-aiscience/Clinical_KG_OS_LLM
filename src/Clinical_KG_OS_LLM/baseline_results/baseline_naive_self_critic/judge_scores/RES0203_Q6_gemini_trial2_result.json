{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the clinical symptoms and the COVID-19 test details (swab, timeline, isolation). However, it contains a significant factual error by claiming the transcript does not mention a plan to consult a supervising physician. In transcript segment [D-40], the clinician explicitly states, 'we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two key points from the Gold Answer: 1) the mention of 'a couple other tests' that might be done [D-40], and 2) the plan to consult with a supervising physician, which was specifically requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided regarding the symptoms and COVID-19 testing is faithful to the transcript. However, the explicit denial of the existence of information about a supervising physician is a false negative hallucination, as the information is present in segment [D-40].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant to the prompt's structure, addressing most parts of the question. It fails to provide the requested information about the supervising physician despite it being in the source text."
