  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer. In the transcript, the doctor *did* systematically explore exposure sources: living situation (apartment, alone) [P-45], home/environmental exposures (old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets) [D-46][P-46], sick contacts (asked explicitly) [D-47][P-47], workplace (asked where they work) [D-48][P-48] and whether anyone there was sick [D-50][P-50], and travel (asked explicitly) [D-49][P-49]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states none of these were explored. It also inaccurately states the patient had “loss of taste,” whereas the patient reported some loss of smell [P-24].",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer’s key exposure-source elements are: (1) living situation, (2) environmental triggers at home, (3) contact with sick individuals, (4) workplace setting and workplace illness, (5) travel history, plus (6) substance-use screening noted in Gold. The Generated Answer includes none of these exposure-history elements (it claims they were not asked) and instead focuses on symptoms, differential, and management. Thus it misses essentially all required points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims are not grounded in the transcript: it asserts the doctor did not ask about living situation/work/travel/sick contacts, but these questions are clearly present [P-45 to P-50]. It also misstates “loss of taste” (transcript: loss of smell) [P-24]. While parts about COVID testing and supportive care are grounded in [D-52], the central claim about lack of exposure exploration is fabricated relative to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to answer the question about exposure exploration, but provides an incorrect denial and shifts to symptom assessment/management. The content is partially on-topic but fails to provide the requested exposure sources."
