  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s core premise is incorrect: the transcript explicitly includes the doctor asking about weight loss [D-22], recent travel [D-23], sick contacts [D-24], and chemical exposure at work [D-34]. Therefore, the conclusion that these questions were not asked, and that the differential cannot be assessed, contradicts the source. It also introduces differentials (e.g., angina/heart attack) not supported by the Gold Answer’s intent for these specific screening questions, and it mischaracterizes the chest pain as exertional when the transcript emphasizes pleuritic worsening with deep breath/cough.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed almost entirely:\n- Weight loss screening for lung cancer and TB; denial lowers likelihood but doesn’t exclude.\n- Travel screening for exposure/endemic infections (e.g., Legionella/fungal); domestic travel to Sarnia with temporal proximity.\n- Sick contacts screening for transmissible respiratory infections/TB exposure; denial reduces known exposure but doesn’t exclude CAP.\n- Chemical exposure screening for chemical pneumonitis/occupational lung disease; limited direct exposure makes it less likely.\nThe Generated Answer does not address how each response narrows/maintains the differential for those four questions.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple unfaithful elements: it explicitly claims there is “no evidence” of the doctor asking those questions (directly contradicted by [D-22], [D-23], [D-24], [D-34]). It references a “Knowledge Graph” not provided in the transcript and adds interpretations (notably exertional chest pain and cardiovascular ischemia framing) that are not grounded in the transcript or Gold Answer’s focus for the queried items. Some details (cough, chills, smoking, family history) are grounded, but the main claims are not.",
    "relevance": "The response largely fails to answer the question asked (differentials being screened by weight loss/travel/sick contacts/chemical exposure and how the patient’s answers affected them). Instead, it states it cannot answer and shifts to unrelated differential discussion."
