{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer highlights fever and sore throat [D-53] as explicit symptoms for infectious etiology like COVID-19, plus broader symptoms [D-24] and husband's case [D-53]; Generated correctly identifies fever and sore throat [D-53] and P-1 self-report, and vaccination history correctly but with wrong citation [P-27 instead of P-53]; hallucinates 'knowledge graph' not present; minor phrasing like 'stuffy throat'; some factual errors but main points align with Gold's core.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: fever/sore throat [D-53], broader cluster muscle aches/fever/stuffy nose/sore throat [D-24], husband symptoms [D-53], flu shot question/no [D-53/P-53] prompting influenza [D-54]; Generated covers fever/sore throat and flu shot/no leading to influenza, misses broader symptoms and husband epidemiology; covers ~50-60% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: symptoms [P-1/D-53/D-24], flu inquiry [D-53/D-54]; wrong citation [P-27] is unrelated to flu shot (actual [P-53]); hallucinates entire 'knowledge graph' and its corroboration, not in transcript; 'stuffy throat' misphrasing; multiple hallucinations and citation error.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured with clear sections directly addressing the two-part question on symptoms for COVID suspicion and vaccination info for influenza differential; no off-topic content."
