{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two-day timeframe and the concurrent nature of the symptoms. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript 'does not specify an order of onset' and that the patient 'does not mention' previous symptoms. In reality, the transcript explicitly confirms the simultaneous onset (P-6) and the patient explicitly denies previous history (P-3).",
    "completeness": "The answer addresses all parts of the question (timeframe, relative onset, fluctuation, and history). It misses the specific details found in the Gold Answer regarding the partial nature of the sensory loss (salty foods vs. banana), which provides a more complete picture of the symptom state.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains some 'hallucinations of omission' or inaccurate claims about the transcript's contents. It claims the transcript lacks evidence or mentions of certain facts (order of onset, previous experience) when those facts were explicitly addressed in the dialogue (P-3, P-6). It also attributes the lack of previous history to P-1 instead of the actual response in P-3.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly follows the structure of the prompt, addressing each clinical aspect asked for without unnecessary tangents."
