  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition ruled out despite family history in grandparents. It accurately captures the mother's citation of no shortness of breath or wheezing even during physical activity [P-28], matching the Gold Answer's core facts. However, it inaccurately cites [P-13] for family history (actual [P-28]) and presents lack of fever/chills from [P-13] as a clinical finding supporting the asthma rule-out, which is unrelated to the asthma discussion in the transcript or Gold Answer and constitutes a factual error in attribution. It omits mention of prior 'workup' and mother's definitive conclusion, leading to some discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) asthma identified; (2) doctor asked about family history [D-28]; (3) grandparents had asthma [P-28]; (4) doctor acknowledged [D-30]; (5) prior 'worked up' [P-28]; (6) no SOB, no wheezing even with activity [P-28]; (7) mother's conclusion 'he doesn't have that' [P-28]; (8) patient healthy otherwise, no prior dry cough [P-24]. Generated covers (1), (3), (6) partially; misses (2), (4), (5), (7), (8). Adds irrelevant fever/chills. Covers ~40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Asthma, grandparents asthma, no SOB/wheezing during activity verifiable in [P-28]. However, family history and no fever/chills incorrectly cited to [P-13] (family history is [P-28]; fever unrelated). No fever/chills presented as support for ruling out asthma is a hallucinated connection not grounded in transcript, where ruling out is explicitly tied to [P-28] only. Multiple citation errors and misattributed reasoning.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by naming asthma, noting grandparents family history, and listing mother's cited findings including no SOB/wheezing even during activity. Minor off-topic inclusion of unrelated fever/chills symptoms."
