  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the first symptom as a stuffy nose, followed by fever present for three days at presentation, with ongoing sore throat and reported muscle aches. It correctly notes the husband has had similar symptoms for about a week. A minor imprecision is that it frames the stuffy nose as occurring “just before the onset of her illness,” whereas the transcript/gold specify it was “just before” the fever (and part of the same illness course). It also does not make the gold answer’s more specific inference that the husband’s onset was ~4 days before the patient’s fever onset, but it does not state an incorrect alternative.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) stuffy nose first; (2) fever followed and has lasted 3 days; (3) sore throat present/ongoing; (4) muscle aches present; (5) husband has similar symptoms for ~1 week and started earlier. Key points missed or under-specified relative to Gold: (a) explicit sequencing that sore throat developed after the stuffy nose and around fever onset; (b) the specific timing/overlap of muscle aches (2–3 days, concurrent with fever); (c) the more explicit comparison/inference that husband’s illness began ~4 days before the patient’s fever onset; (d) the gold’s note that staggered onset supports possible household transmission (contextual, but still part of gold). Overall, this is partial but not full coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are supported by the transcript (stuffy nose before fever; fever for 3 days; sore throat; muscle aches; husband symptomatic for a week). It avoids adding new symptoms or unsupported exposures. The only inference (husband earlier than the patient’s 3-day fever window) is consistent with the transcript and is clearly framed as an interpretation rather than a quoted fact.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested chronological symptom progression and comparison to the husband’s timeline, with no significant tangents."

  "summary": "The answer is largely accurate and well-grounded in the transcript, but it omits several timeline specifics emphasized in the gold answer (sore throat sequencing, muscle-ache timing overlap, and a clearer quantified comparison to the husband)."
