  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the timeline (diagnosed at 8, currently 10) and the general symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing). However, it contains a significant factual error: it claims goldfish are a potential trigger, whereas the transcript only mentions them as pets [P-39] and the patient explicitly denies other triggers [P-10]. It also omits the specific frequency metrics for bronchodilator use (once every two weeks vs. 5-6 times per week) which were requested in the prompt and present in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific 'once every two weeks' baseline frequency. 2) The specific '5-6 times per week' current frequency. 3) The clinical nuance that wheezing episodes occur more frequently than bronchodilator use. 4) The mention of chest tightness. 5) The exclusion of infection as a cause.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful but hallucinates that goldfish are a trigger. The transcript mentions goldfish only in response to a question about pets, and the patient had already stated there were no other triggers earlier in the conversation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, following the requested structure and addressing the evolution of the condition, though it lacks the specific data points requested by the prompt's context."
