  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major factual elements from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the physical exam, blood work for Lyme serology, tick species identification, prophylactic antibiotics due to 72+ hour attachment, physician consultation, and preventive advice about ticks in long grass and insecticide use. All facts align with the transcript references provided.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key components mentioned in the Gold Answer: diagnostic tests (physical exam, blood work, tick identification), treatment (prophylactic antibiotics), physician consultation, and preventive advice (tick habitat, identification methods, insecticide). However, it lacks some specific details present in the Gold Answer, such as the patient bringing the tick in a plastic container [P-1], the geographic risk factor from Strathroy [D-13], the specific quote 'probably safer than not to start you on some medications' [D-18], and the clarification that this appears to be a trainee-supervised encounter. These omissions represent approximately 15-20% of the Gold Answer's detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with appropriate citation tags [D-18, D-6]. No hallucinated information is present. The answer appropriately references the source material and does not introduce facts not found in the transcript. The citations are accurate and support the claims made.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all aspects of the question: diagnostic tests (laboratory and physical), treatments, physician consultation, and preventive advice about garden/outdoor environment. The response is well-organized, categorized appropriately, and contains no irrelevant information. It stays focused on the clinical plan as requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and highly relevant response that covers all major components of the doctor's clinical plan. It correctly identifies diagnostic tests, treatment recommendations, physician consultation, and preventive advice with proper transcript citations. The answer loses minor points on completeness for omitting some contextual details (plastic container, Strathroy geographic reference, specific quotes, trainee supervision context) that appear in the Gold Answer, but all core information is present and correct. No factual errors or hallucinations are present, and the response directly addresses all aspects of the question."
