  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the pain as sharp and strong, the 20-minute duration, and the deep breath trigger. However, it contains a significant error: it claims the pain only occurs during anxiety attacks based on P-20. In the transcript, P-20 refers to heart fluttering/palpitations, not the chest pain. The chest pain actually occurs when the patient is alone, walking, or studying (P-4, P-29).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer, such as the initial description of the sensation as 'odd' or 'uncomfortable', the fact that it occurs at rest, that it does not worsen with exercise, and the specific resolution criteria (talking to others or working with hands).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misinterprets P-20, attributing the frequency of heart palpitations ('only during anxiety attacks') to the chest pain. The patient actually states they have not seen a doctor for anxiety attacks in eight years, making the claim that current episodes only happen during such attacks unfaithful to the patient's description of their current symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant as it directly addresses the prompt's requirements for quality, duration, triggers, and situational occurrence/resolution, even though some information provided is factually incorrect."
