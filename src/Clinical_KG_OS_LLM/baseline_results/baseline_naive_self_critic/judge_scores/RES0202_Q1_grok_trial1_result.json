  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies some reported symptoms like dry cough worsening (partial, misses 3-day timeline from Wed), runny nose, fever >100°F (misses specifics like 100.1/101 on Friday), fatigue, loss of taste, and loss of appetite (attributes appetite to P-17 instead of P-15). However, it misses shortness of breath uncertainty [P-8] and has major errors in the denied symptoms section: claims none of the examples (wheezing [D-7/P-7], sore throat [D-14/P-14], chest pain [D-13/P-13], chills [D-19/P-19], GI [D-22/P-22, D-23/P-23]) were asked/denied, directly contradicting the transcript and Gold Answer. Significant contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: cough (partial), runny nose, fever (partial), fatigue, decreased appetite (partial), loss of taste; misses cough timeline/details [P-5,P-12], fever details [P-2], SOB uncertainty [P-8]. Completely misses all pertinent negatives (sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, rashes, GI issues, etc.) which are ~50% of Gold content. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: cough [P-1,P-5], runny nose [P-16], fever [P-1], fatigue [P-1,P-8,P-25], taste/appetite [P-17,P-15]. Hallucinates absence of doctor inquiries on wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, GI (explicitly in D-7,D-13,D-14,D-19,D-22,D-23 with denials P-7,P-13,P-14,P-19,P-22,P-23). Adds irrelevant later neurological advice [D-44] as 'asked and denied' (not denied then). Multiple hallucinations of absences.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and doctor-asked/denied symptoms, matching question parts. Minor tangent on later neurological symptoms [D-44] not part of history-taking denials, but overall focused on question."
