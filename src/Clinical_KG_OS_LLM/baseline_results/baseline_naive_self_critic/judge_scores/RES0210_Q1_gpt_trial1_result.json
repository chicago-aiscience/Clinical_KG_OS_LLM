  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient’s productive cough, sputum description (“yellow custard” with “spots of red”), right-sided chest pain location, and chills—all of which are present in the transcript. The main minor accuracy issue is that it frames the cough duration only as “a couple of days” [P-1] without incorporating the later clarification that symptoms began as a raspy cough on Friday and worsened significantly by Sunday [P-3, P-4]. Otherwise, there are no clear contradictory or false statements relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) cough present, (2) sputum color/appearance including red spots, (3) right-sided chest pain location, (4) chills. Key elements missed: (1) detailed sputum timing (started Sunday; yellow + red started simultaneously) [P-4, P-7], (2) chest pain quality and course—constant, dull, present even at rest/lying down—and pleuritic features (worse with deep breath/cough) [P-18 to P-21], (3) subjective fever starting Monday and persisting, no measured temperature [P-8], (4) mild dyspnea on exertion with no resting dyspnea [P-10, P-11], (5) sore/raw throat after coughing [P-15], (6) prior runny nose that resolved [P-16], (7) negative weight loss [P-22]. Overall, it captures only a minority of the requested specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are directly supported by the transcript citations provided ([P-1], [P-6], [P-17], [P-9]). No hallucinated symptoms or unsupported details are introduced. The answer is faithful but incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the asked symptom domains (sputum, chest pain, systemic symptoms) and does not add irrelevant information. However, it does not fully address the requested specifics (quality of pain, fever), which affects completeness more than relevance."
