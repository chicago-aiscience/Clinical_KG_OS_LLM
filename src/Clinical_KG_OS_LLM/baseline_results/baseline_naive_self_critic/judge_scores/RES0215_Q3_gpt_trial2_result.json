  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s diagnosis of asthma (including exercise-induced/allergic asthma) is consistent with the Gold Answer’s conclusion of pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and atopic predisposition. The cited supporting findings (exercise trigger, cold worsening, seasonal allergies, wheeze/SOB) align with the transcript and do not contradict the Gold Answer. Minor imprecision: it does not explicitly frame this as “exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the context of atopy,” but the meaning is essentially preserved.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer supports included: (1) exercise-triggered symptoms [P-3], (2) cold-weather worsening [P-38], (3) seasonal allergies/atopy [P-35, P-36], and (4) wheeze/SOB/difficulty deep breaths [P-1, P-2].\nMissed major Gold Answer supports: episodic/reversible pattern with rest improvement [P-6, P-33]; occurrence across multiple settings [P-38] and at home [P-40-41]; nocturnal wheeze/trouble falling asleep [P-43-44]; and pertinent negatives arguing against infection (no fever/runny nose/sick contacts/phlegm) [P-7, P-8, P-10, P-31]. Overall this is ~50–70% coverage of the Gold Answer’s key supporting points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by transcript quotes with appropriate pointers ([P-1], [P-2], [P-3], [P-35], [P-36], [P-38]). However, the reference to a “Knowledge Graph” is not present in the transcript and is therefore an ungrounded/hallucinated element. Aside from that, the reasoning remains transcript-consistent.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers both parts of the question: it names the most likely respiratory diagnosis and lists specific transcript findings supporting it. The only minor distraction is the unnecessary ‘Knowledge Graph’ mention, but content remains focused on the diagnostic justification."

  "summary": "Accurately identifies asthma and supports it with several key transcript findings, but omits multiple important supporting details (reversibility with rest, multi-setting occurrence, nocturnal symptoms, and infectious negatives) and includes a minor ungrounded ‘Knowledge Graph’ reference."
