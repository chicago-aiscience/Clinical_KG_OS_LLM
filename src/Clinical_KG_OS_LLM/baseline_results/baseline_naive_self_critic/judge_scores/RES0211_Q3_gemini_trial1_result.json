  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer's reasoning. However, it makes a slight clinical logical error by stating that being 'tired' serves as a 'proxy for subjective fever.' In the transcript (P-7, P-9), the patient explicitly confirms feeling hot day and night, providing direct evidence for subjective fever rather than requiring a proxy. The core facts regarding the symptoms and the diagnosis remain correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points, including the dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, and the absence of sputum, GI symptoms, and joint pain. It misses the epidemiological link mentioned in the Gold Answer: the fact that Jessica's brother had a cold a few weeks prior, which supports a viral URI assessment through household exposure.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. The only minor issue is the interpretation of 'tired' as a proxy for fever when the patient explicitly mentions feeling hot, but this does not constitute a major hallucination as the symptoms are present in the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to answer how the presence and absence of specific symptoms support the URI diagnosis, following the prompt's constraints closely and even adding a relevant section on the exclusion of allergies based on the transcript context (P-16). balance of positive and negative findings is well maintained. High marks for relevance despite the slight missed point on the brother's illness."
