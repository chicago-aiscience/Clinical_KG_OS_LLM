    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly claims that chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea were NOT asked about in the transcript, when in fact all four were explicitly asked and denied (D-10/P-10 for runny nose, D-15/P-15 for nausea, D-16/P-16 for chest pain, D-17/P-17 for palpitations). The answer then attempts to explain the clinical significance of these absent symptoms, which is correct in principle, but the foundation is wrong since it denies their presence in the transcript. The Generated Answer does correctly identify other symptoms from the transcript (cough, appetite, taste) but misses the core symptoms specified in the question.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover most key points from the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer comprehensively lists 8 explicitly denied symptoms (runny nose, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling), while the Generated Answer incorrectly claims four of these weren't in the transcript and only discusses three other symptoms not central to the question. The Generated Answer provides some differential diagnosis reasoning but misses most of the specific symptom denials and their clinical significance detailed in the Gold Answer. Coverage is approximately 20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination by stating 'The provided transcript segments do not explicitly contain the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea' when these exchanges are clearly present in the transcript at D-10/P-10, D-15/P-15, D-16/P-16, and D-17/P-17. This is directly contradicted by the source material. While the differential diagnosis reasoning is plausible, the foundational claim about what's in the transcript is fabricated and incorrect. This represents a significant faithfulness violation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question about denied symptoms and differential diagnosis, but does so by first incorrectly claiming the specified symptoms aren't in the transcript, then providing differential reasoning based on their hypothetical absence. The second half discussing differentiation is relevant to the question's intent, but the first half that denies the presence of these symptoms in the transcript is directly contrary to what was asked. Overall relevance is compromised by this fundamental misreading of the source material, though the clinical reasoning portion is on-topic."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains a critical error in claiming that chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea were not asked about in the transcript, when all four were explicitly addressed (D-10, D-15, D-16, D-17). This factual inaccuracy undermines the entire response, as it misses the core symptoms specified in the question. While the answer provides clinically sound differential diagnosis reasoning, it applies this reasoning to the wrong set of symptoms and fails to cover most of the 8 denied symptoms detailed in the Gold Answer. The response demonstrates significant hallucination by denying the presence of clearly documented exchanges in the transcript. Coverage of key points is poor (approximately 20-30%), and the foundational error severely impacts correctness, completeness, faithfulness, and relevance."
