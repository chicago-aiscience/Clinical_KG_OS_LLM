  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication with accurate citation [P-23], fully consistent with Gold Answer. The circumstance is described via direct quote from [P-9] ('kind of forgot to take my med'), which is factual and mentioned in Gold, but Gold emphasizes the more specific daughter's birthday celebration and routine change [P-24]; this represents a minor discrepancy in specificity rather than a factual error.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Keppra for epilepsy [P-23, P-8]; 2) forgot med [P-9]; 3) specific circumstance - daughter's birthday celebration, usually takes with dinner but did things differently (earlier celebration, no later dinner, completely forgot) [P-24]; 4) doctor acknowledgment it happens/makes sense [D-25]; 5) isolated lapse, not adherence issue [D-24, P-24]; 6) likely contributed to seizure [P-9]. Covered: Keppra [P-23], forgot med [P-9]. Missed: epilepsy, all birthday/routine details [P-24], doctor comments [D-25, D-24], seizure link details. Covers approximately 20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All content grounded in transcript: Keppra directly from [P-23], exact quote 'kind of forgot to take my med' from [P-9]. Citations precise and verifiable. No unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question's two parts (medication for chronic condition, specific circumstance for missed dose) with clear bullet-point structure and no off-topic content."
