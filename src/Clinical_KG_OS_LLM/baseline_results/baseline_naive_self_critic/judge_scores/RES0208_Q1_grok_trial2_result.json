  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer includes accurate facts like loss of taste (P-4), overall achiness (P-20), subjective fever (P-4), and decreased appetite (P-2, P-4), which match Gold. However, it incorrectly categorizes descriptions of shortness of breath (laborious breathing, deep breaths from P-3) as an 'upper respiratory complaint,' despite the question excluding chief complaints of shortness of breath. It also misquotes the taste loss slightly (double negative error) and omits key Gold points like diminished smell (P-6), sore throat (P-9), dry cough details (P-7/P-8), denial of congestion (P-10), weakness (P-2), and headaches (P-11-13). Some factual errors and omissions lead to partial consistency.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: sensory (taste loss P-4, smell loss P-6, novelty P-5); upper resp (emerging dry cough P-7/8, emerging sore throat P-9, no runny nose/congestion P-10); musculo (generalized aches P-20/21, weakness P-2); const (subjective fever P-4, dec appetite P-2/4/18, usual headaches P-11-13). Generated covers: taste loss, achiness, fever, appetite loss (4/11 points, ~35%). Misses smell, cough/sore throat/congestion denial, weakness, headaches. Includes irrelevant SOB details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: taste P-4 (grounded despite minor quote inaccuracy), breathing P-3, dry throat P-8 (from cough desc), achy P-20, hot/warm P-4, appetite P-2/4. No hallucinations or fabricated content; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response by requested categories (sensory, upper resp, musculo, const) and focuses on patient's reported symptoms beyond chief complaints. Minor irrelevance in including SOB descriptions under upper resp, but overall tightly addresses the question."
