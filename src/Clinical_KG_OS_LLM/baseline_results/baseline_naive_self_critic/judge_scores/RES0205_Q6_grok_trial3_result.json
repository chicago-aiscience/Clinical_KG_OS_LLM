  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer's core facts precisely: it correctly identifies the physical exam components (listening to heart and lungs plus a quick/general physical exam from [D-37]), the multi-step process (consult with supervising doctor, review discussion, return to discuss next steps), and cites [D-37] accurately. No factual errors or contradictions, though it omits supplementary details like the foreshadowing in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], and trainee context. All stated elements are fully consistent. Score: 5.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: multi-step plan [D-37] (100%), specific PE components (heart/lungs auscultation and quick physical exam) (100%), collaborative process details (get supervising doctor, review everything discussed, return to discuss next steps) (100%). Missed: foreshadowing at [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], note on no diagnosis/meds and trainee context. Core question-specific points (plan at end, PE, process) fully covered; supplementary details ~80-99% overall coverage. Score: 4.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-37]: 'quick listen to your heart and lungs' and 'quick physical exam'; 'go get the doctor that I'm working with'; 'go over everything you talked about'; 'come back and talk to you about where to go from here'. Paraphrasing accurate (e.g., 'general physical exam' for 'quick physical exam', 'plan for the future' for 'where to go from here'). Citations correct, no hallucinations or unverifiable details. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around 'Physical Examination Components' and 'Process for Determining Next Steps' at the end of consultation, directly quoting/paraphrasing [D-37] without tangents or off-topic content. Score: 5"
