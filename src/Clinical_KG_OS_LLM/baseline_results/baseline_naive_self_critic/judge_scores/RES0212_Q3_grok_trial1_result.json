  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer proposes 'Bacterial Pneumonia or Acute Bacterial Bronchitis,' which partially aligns with Gold's 'acute bronchitis with possible bacterial superinfection or early community-acquired pneumonia' but overstates definitiveness as 'bacterial' without Gold's caution and ignores the superimposed chronic cough context. It inaccurately states cough duration as 'approximately a month' (vs Gold's accurate 3-month intermittent with 3-day acute productive phase). Critically, it claims 'transcript does not explicitly mention fevers' despite clear [P-4] 'feeling like hot at night,' substituting fatigue instead, introducing factual errors. Sputum color is correctly noted as suggestive of bacterial but not contextualized as Gold does. Significant factual errors and contradictions warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold covers: specific diagnosis with chronic overlay; precise contributions of 3-day productive cough (transition to inflammation), greenish sputum (infectious etiology, bacterial concern), subjective fevers (systemic response); [D-47] summary; absences of other symptoms. Generated covers partial diagnosis and rough contributions for cough/sputum but misses chronic context, acute timeline, proper fever role, doctor's synthesis, and lacks nuance on absences/no vitals. Covers ~30-40% of key points (diagnosis outline, sputum evidence) but misses or distorts most others. Score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: productive cough citations [P-1,P-3,P-19]; greenish sputum [P-9]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: denies fevers exist in transcript (contradicts [P-4]); invents 'Knowledge Graph' links (absent); misemphasizes cough as month-long vs full history; implies fatigue as fever proxy without transcript basis for equating. Multiple hallucinations and inaccurate citations vs transcript. Score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three features (productive cough, sputum color, subjective fever/systemic), proposes diagnosis, and explains contributions, closely mirroring question despite inaccuracies. Minor off-topic 'Knowledge Graph' tangent. Score 4."
