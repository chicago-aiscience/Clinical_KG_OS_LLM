{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer regarding the core symptoms (cough, chest soreness, sore throat, runny nose, and mucus). It correctly distinguishes between current and resolved symptoms and correctly attributes the chest soreness to excessive coughing rather than independent chest pain.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly less detailed than the Gold Answer. It misses several specific points: the frequency of the cough (3-4 times per hour), the lack of triggers (spontaneous), the specific duration for each resolved symptom (e.g., 2-3 days for sore throat, 4-5 days for mucus), the description of the mucus (whitish clear), and the list of pertinent negatives (fever, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, belly pain).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript. All mentioned symptoms and their status (resolved vs. present) are supported by the patient's statements. It does not hallucinate any clinical information.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by listing the symptoms reported during the two-week illness and categorizing them by their current status."
