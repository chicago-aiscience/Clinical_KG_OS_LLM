  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately states that the patient is on an unspecified statin for cholesterol (patient cannot recall name), that prophylactic antibiotics were proposed due to likely prolonged tick attachment, and that the patient previously took antibiotics for a prior tick bite with a target/bullseye rash. These points align with the Gold Answer and the transcript. No incorrect medication names, doses, or durations were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) current statin therapy (unspecified), (2) prior antibiotics for past tick bite/target rash, (3) new plan for prophylactic antibiotics for this tick bite.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (a) explicit denial of allergies/no drug allergies, (b) plan to send the tick to the lab for species identification, (c) possible blood work/serology, (d) plan to consult the supervising physician before finalizing, and (e) environmental prevention advice (insecticide). Also missing the clarification that no specific antibiotic/dose/duration was stated.",
    "faithfulness": "All included clinical claims are supported by the transcript citations ([P-15], [D-6], [P-3]). The phrase “based on the provided transcript and knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript, but it does not add clinical content. No substantive hallucinated treatments or medications were added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments discussed, specifically the current statin and the proposed prophylactic antibiotics for the tick bite, which directly answers the question. Minor omission of other discussed treatments (testing/prevention) affects completeness more than relevance."
