  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the condition as COVID (equivalent to Gold's COVID-19), the test as covid swab with correct citation [D-43], and the prompting social contact detail from [P-20] (sick friend, walking dogs outdoors, too close proximity), matching the core facts in Gold without contradictions; minor wording differences (COVID vs COVID-19) are negligible.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: condition (COVID-19), test (covid swab [D-43]), main social contact detail (friends walking dogs, one sick, too close [P-20]). Missed: exact phrasing like 'a bit sick for a bit' and 'feel too safe outside', doctor's question about friend's COVID test [D-21/P-21], symptom screening (smell/taste/confusion/aches), and travel denial; covers core ~85% of Gold's content.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in transcript: condition/test [D-43], social contacts [P-20]; minor issues include 'knowledge graph' (unverifiable, not in transcript, possible hallucination) and imprecise citation in summary ([D-43] does not detail walking); mostly verifiable with accurate quotes/cites.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to question's three parts (condition, test, social detail) with focused sections and summary; no off-topic content."
