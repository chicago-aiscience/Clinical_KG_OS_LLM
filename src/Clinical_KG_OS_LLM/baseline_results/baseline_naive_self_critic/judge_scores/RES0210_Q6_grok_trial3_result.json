  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states there are no Doctor statements in the transcript, missing the explicit plan in [D-43] where the doctor says they will 'go over this with the physician I’m working with and we should be back shortly together to talk to you about the next steps,' directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript. Self-care covers Tylenol correctly but omits expectoration [P-13] and explicitly taking it easy [P-10]. Aggravating factors partially match (exertion [P-10/11], coughing [P-19]) but downplays/misses deep breathing [P-18] as a key pleuritic trigger highlighted in Gold. Alleviating factors cover Tylenol and rest but miss expectoration. References to 'knowledge graph' are unsupported. Significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Doctor plan [D-43] (0% covered); self-care (Tylenol [P-14], expectoration [P-13], taking it easy [P-10]) - covers 1/3; aggravating (deep breathing [P-18], coughing [P-19], exertion [P-10/11]) - covers 2/3; alleviating (Tylenol, expectoration, resting [P-10]) - covers 2/3; clinical relevance note - not covered. Overall ~40% coverage (5/12 key elements), missing core doctor's plan and several specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "Major hallucination claiming 'no statements or turns attributed to the Doctor' despite full transcript with [D-1] to [D-44]; unverifiable 'knowledge graph' references not in transcript; misrepresents deep breathing as 'not explicitly named as a sole trigger' when [P-18] directly states 'Taking a deep breath makes it feel pretty bad'; attributes cough rawness [P-15] inaccurately to chest pain; other claims like Tylenol relieving cough (it's for fever/discomfort [P-14]) are stretched. Multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three question components (doctor's plan, self-care, aggravating/alleviating factors), uses transcript citations where applicable, and addresses clinical management indirectly; minor off-topic via hallucinated knowledge graph but remains focused on query."
