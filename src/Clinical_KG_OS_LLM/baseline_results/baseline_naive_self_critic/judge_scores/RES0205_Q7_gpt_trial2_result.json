  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most statements align with the Gold Answer/transcript: cough present ~2 weeks; early flu-like symptoms; mucus described as “whitish clear”; mucus lasted ~4–5 days; cough became dry after day 4–5; other non-cough symptoms resolved by day 3–4; cough-related chest soreness occurs. Minor issues: the label “Mucus Phase (Days 4–5)” is imprecise because mucus was present throughout the first 4–5 days (not specifically only on days 4–5). Also, describing this as “chest pain” is slightly misleading because the patient denied chest pain and described soreness after coughing.",
    "completeness": "Covered key elements: start (~2 weeks), initial flu-like symptoms, mucus appearance (whitish/clear), mucus duration (4–5 days), transition to dry cough, and resolution of other symptoms by day 3–4.\nMissing from Gold Answer: (1) sore throat timeline (first 2–3 days, then resolved), (2) runny nose explicitly and its resolution, (3) cough intensity remained the same over 2 weeks, (4) cough frequency remained stable and estimate (3–4 times/hour), (5) cough is spontaneous/no triggers, (6) no fever at any point, (7) COVID test at onset negative and stayed home awaiting resolution. Overall this is substantially incomplete relative to the “complete timeline” request.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all included claims are supported by the transcript. Small ungrounded/misleading elements: reference to a “knowledge graph provided” (not in evidence) and calling the symptom “chest pain” rather than cough-related soreness after coughing. Otherwise no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays on the symptom timeline and progression, which is what the question asks. However, it fails to address several specifically requested timeline components (especially cough intensity/frequency changes and resolution details for sore throat/runny nose), making it only partially responsive to the full prompt."

  "summary": "The generated answer is mostly accurate and transcript-grounded but omits multiple key timeline details (especially sore throat/runny nose course and cough intensity/frequency stability), so it is only partially complete and partially responsive."
