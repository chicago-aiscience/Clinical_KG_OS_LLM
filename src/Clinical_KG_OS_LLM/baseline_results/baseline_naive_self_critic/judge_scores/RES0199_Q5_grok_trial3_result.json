  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor did not systematically explore living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence (e.g., D-45 to D-50 explicitly cover living situation [P-45, P-46], work [P-48, P-50], sick contacts [P-47], travel [P-49]). It fabricates that no such dialogue exists, while Gold Answer accurately summarizes these explorations. Score: 1.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: living situation (apartment, alone), environmental triggers (denied), sick contacts (home/work lunch), workplace (car dealership, no sick colleagues), travel (denied), substance use screening. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying exploration entirely and listing unrelated focuses like symptoms and management. Score: 1.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates absence of key transcript segments (e.g., claims no questions on travel/workplace/interactions, but D-45/D-46/D-47/D-48/D-49/D-50 directly contradict this). Citations like [D-52] are accurate but irrelevant; overall, largely ungrounded and fabricates non-exploration. Score: 1.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly responds to the question by claiming no exploration of specified sources and summarizing consultation focus, with no off-topic tangents. Score: 5."
