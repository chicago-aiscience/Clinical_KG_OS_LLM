  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies some reported symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, feeling crappy, headache) matching Gold, but misses key ones like feeling 'really hot' persistently (feverish, P-7/P-9), malaise/icky/crappy explicitly tied to 3-4 days, and tiredness (P-13). It significantly errs on denials by claiming no explicit mentions of denying sputum, nausea, joint pain, rashes (contradicting Gold's citations P-5/P-6, P-10, P-11, P-12, P-13), misinterprets P-13 as general pain denial instead of joint aches, and notes implicit sputum denial while ignoring explicit. Core duration tie-in is weak. Significant factual contradictions warrant 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key reported points: 3-4 day history, dry cough/scratchy throat, pounding/active headache, feeling hot day/night, crappy/icky/malaise, tired (6 points). Covered: dry cough, scratchy throat, crappy, headache (4/6). Gold denied: sputum/phlegm, rashes/skin changes, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, joint aches, breathing difficulty (6 points). Covered: partial joint aches/tired (1/6, misinterpreted). Total coverage ~30-40% (4/12 points), so 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms verifiable in P-1/P-4. P-13 denial of 'hurting' verifiable but interpretive. However, hallucinates 'no explicit mentions' of denying sputum (explicit P-5/P-6 'No, no nothing'), nausea (P-11 'No'), diarrhea (P-12 'No'), rashes (P-10 'I don't think so'), joint pain (P-13 'No'); references non-existent 'knowledge graph'; multiple incorrect claims about transcript content. Score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response with 'Reported Symptoms' and 'Denied Symptoms' sections addressing the question on 3-4 day symptoms and explicit denials (with examples); minor interpretive tangents but focused. Score 4."
