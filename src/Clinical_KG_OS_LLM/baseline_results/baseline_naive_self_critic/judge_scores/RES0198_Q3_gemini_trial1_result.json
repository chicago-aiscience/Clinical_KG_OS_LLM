{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the doctor's conclusion of a viral infection and the primary symptoms of stuffy/runny nose. However, it mentions the 'on and off' nature from P-1 while ignoring the patient's later clarification in P-8 that the symptoms have been 'pretty constant'. It also lacks the specific clinical reasoning found in the Gold Answer regarding why the symptoms weren't bacterial or allergic.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly incomplete. It fails to address several key components requested by the prompt: (1) discharge quality (clear vs. colored), (2) absent features (no fever, cough, or sore throat) which are critical for ruling out bacterial causes, and (3) exposure history (the nephew in daycare). It also misses the specific evidence against an allergic cause, such as the lack of exposure to triggers or personal allergy history.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript for the points it does include, citing specific turns correctly. It does not hallucinate information, though it is very selective in what it reports.",
    "relevance": "While the answer is relevant to the general topic, it fails to provide the specific evidence requested by the prompt to differentiate the infection from 'allergic or bacterial' causes. It focuses mostly on the viral diagnosis without the 'differential' evidence (like the absence of fever or lack of allergen exposure) that the prompt specifically asked for."
