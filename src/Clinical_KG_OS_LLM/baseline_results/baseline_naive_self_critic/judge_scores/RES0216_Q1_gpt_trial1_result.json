  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several present symptoms (chest tightness with inspiration; difficulty getting a full breath; hoarseness; increased phlegm/throat clearing; denial of chest pain and cough). However, it contains a major factual error by stating that the transcript does not contain explicit denials for fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating—these are explicitly denied in P-6 and P-12 through P-15. This directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Present symptoms: Partially covered (chest tightness, dyspnea/“whole breath,” hoarseness, phlegm/throat clearing). Missing key Gold Answer details: diffuse/all-over nature of tightness and triggers/worsening with exertion (walking), deep inspiration, and getting up from a chair.\nDenied symptoms: Only includes chest pain and cough; misses explicit denials of anxiety/sweating/impending doom, fevers, night sweats, chills, and weight loss. Overall coverage is well below 80% of Gold Answer elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Most listed symptoms/denials are supported by cited transcript lines. But the concluding note claiming the transcript lacks explicit denials of fevers/night sweats/chills/weight loss/anxiety/sweating is not supported and is contradicted by P-6 and P-12–P-15. This is a significant ungrounded/incorrect claim, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested domains (respiratory/upper airway/chest complaints and explicit denials) and does not introduce major irrelevant content. Despite omissions and one incorrect note, it remains generally on-topic."
