  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states all three symptoms began simultaneously two days prior, citing P-1, P-2, and explicit confirmation for cough at D-6/P-6. Generated Answer correctly notes two days prior and concurrency but hedges by saying 'no specific order specified' and cough mentioned 'subsequently' in P-1, which downplays the explicit confirmation. Gold details consistency for sensory (D-5/P-5) and cough (D-8/P-8) without fluctuation; Generated correctly infers no worsening/fluctuation but omits these details and adds a minor interpretation of smell decline from baseline without over-time change. Gold notes partial sensory loss persisted (P-4); Generated omits this. Gold cites explicit 'no prior history' (D-3/P-3); Generated incorrectly claims 'does not mention' prior symptoms (only references P-1). Some factual errors (prior symptoms mention, onset precision) but core facts (simultaneous onset, no progression, no prior) align.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: simultaneous onset of all three (2 days prior), cough confirmation same time, sensory consistent/no fluctuation, cough consistent/no worsening, none intermittent, partial sensory loss persisted, no prior similar symptoms. Generated covers: 2-day onset, concurrent/relative timing (though hedged), no worsening/fluctuation, no prior experience. Misses: explicit cough timing confirmation, direct consistency statements, partial nature persistence. Covers ~80% of Gold's key points, missing some supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript except: 'does not specify order of onset' overlooks D-6/P-6 confirmation (though P-1 sequence noted); 'does not mention' prior symptoms ignores direct denial at D-3/P-3; no worsening inferred correctly from P-5/P-8 but not cited. No hallucinations—paraphrases like mild cough (P-1), decline from baseline (P-1) accurate. Minor inaccuracies in referencing transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly around the question's elements (onset timing/relative, severity/fluctuation, prior experience) with focused sections, no off-topic content, perfectly addresses query."
