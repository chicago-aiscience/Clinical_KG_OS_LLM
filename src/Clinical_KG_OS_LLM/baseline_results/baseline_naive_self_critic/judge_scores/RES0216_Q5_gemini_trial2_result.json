  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core relationship: the patient's history of asthma and self-directed medication reduction (skipping doses and failing to refill the rescue inhaler) led to an asthma recurrence/exacerbation. However, it contains a minor factual error regarding transcript interpretation: it cites [D-36] as observing the patient is having 'harder to get a whole breath,' whereas in [D-36], the doctor actually states the patient did NOT really get out of breath with exercise (distinguishing the symptoms from a cardiac ischemic picture).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 80% of the Gold Answer's key points. It successfully links the history, the medication changes, and the doctor's assessment. It misses some specific clinical details mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the symptoms of increased phlegm and hoarseness [P-11], and the doctor's specific immediate plan to re-introduce rescue puffers as the first treatment step [D-35].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is generally well-grounded but includes a hallucinated reference to a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source materials. Additionally, the citation of [D-36] is unfaithful to the doctor's actual statement in that turn, which was intended to minimize the 'out of breath' symptom to lower the cardiac differential.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the multi-part question with a clear step-by-step breakdown."
