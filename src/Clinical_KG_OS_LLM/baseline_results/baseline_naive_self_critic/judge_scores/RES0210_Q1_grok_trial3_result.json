  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports facts directly from the transcript that align with the Gold Answer: cough described as 'pretty bad' for 'a couple of days' (consistent with initial report, though Gold provides fuller timeline), sputum as 'yellow custard' with 'spots of red' (exact match), chest pain on the 'right' side (matches), and chills (matches). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: productive cough (partial, misses timeline details like raspy on Friday, severe Sunday); sputum description (yellow custard with red spots, full); chest pain location (right side, yes) but misses quality (constant, dull, worsens with cough/deep breath); chills (yes) but misses fever (subjective from Monday), dyspnea on exertion, sore throat, runny nose, no weight loss. Covers approximately 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: cough [P-1], sputum [P-6], chest pain right side [P-17], chills [P-9]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists patient-reported symptoms in bullet points, focusing on cough, sputum description, chest pain location, and chills, which address the question's specifics (sputum color/appearance, chest pain location/quality partial, systemic chills), with no off-topic content."
