  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it claims that the transcript does not contain explicit verbal denials for symptoms like sore throat, cough, fever, or loss of taste and smell. In reality, the transcript shows the patient explicitly denying cough [P-4], sore throat/fever/chills [P-7], and loss of taste/smell [P-16]. It also misses the fact that the discharge was 'mostly clear' [P-5].",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete as it fails to list the specific symptoms denied by the patient (cough, sore throat, fever, etc.), which was a core part of the question. It also omits the 'clear' character of the nasal discharge.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer lacks faithfulness by asserting that information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present. This is a failure of grounding/retrieval within the provided source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it correctly identifies the reported symptoms (stuffy and runny nose), but it fails to provide the requested information for the latter two parts of the multi-part question."
