  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's stated diagnosis as a viral infection/common cold from [D-39], matching the Gold Answer. Supportive care (hydration and Tylenol Cold) aligns perfectly. Diagnostic test (COVID swab, 48 hours) is correct, though it omits 'today.' Public health guidance matches exactly. Minor discrepancy: Generated elaborates on COVID as a 'potential cause to rule out,' which is inferred from transcript but not explicitly stated as part of the diagnosis in Gold; also misses 'few weeks to resolve' and 'not much besides supportive care' phrasings. Core facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers diagnosis (viral/common cold), supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (COVID swab, 48h results), public health (isolation, further public health instructions). Missed key points from Gold: symptoms take 'a few weeks' to resolve, 'not much that we can do besides supportive care,' swab 'today,' and 'based on stuffy/runny nose presentation.' Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All specific claims (quotes and details) are directly verifiable in [D-39] of the transcript, with accurate citations. Minor unverifiable detail: introductory mention of 'knowledge graph,' which is not in the transcript. No hallucinations; COVID potential is grounded in 'symptoms can also be seen in covid patients.'",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured precisely around the question's required elements (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance), with no off-topic content or tangents."
