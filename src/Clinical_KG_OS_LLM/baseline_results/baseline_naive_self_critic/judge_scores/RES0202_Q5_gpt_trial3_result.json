  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors relative to the Gold Answer/transcript:\n- Timeline/source framing: It states symptoms began “after returning home on Thursday,” but the mother said he came home from school Wednesday and started coughing that night, then stayed home Thursday [P-1].\n- School notification: It claims the transcript has no information about whether the school notified them of exposures, but the mother explicitly said, “they haven’t… contacted us about anything” [P-39].\n- Sick contacts outside school: The Gold Answer notes the mother clearly denied known sick contacts outside school (“we know for sure, not outside of school”) [P-38]; the Generated Answer fails to state this clearly and instead references activity level (“not been running outside much” [P-8]) which is unrelated to sick contacts.\n- It also misses/does not accurately convey that school attendance was central because mother suspected he could have gotten COVID “at school” [P-2].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered vs missed:\n- Covered (partial): Mentions school as a possible source in a general way.\n- Missed: \n  - Mother’s explicit suspicion of COVID acquisition at school [P-2].\n  - Correct symptom onset after returning from school Wednesday [P-1].\n  - Clear statement of no known sick contacts outside of school [P-38].\n  - Acknowledgement that school exposure status was “kinda hard to say” because he attends school [P-38].\n  - School had NOT contacted the family about exposures [P-39].\n  - School required a COVID test for return and to manage exposures for other children [P-41].\n  - (More minor context from Gold): no travel and no home environmental exposures narrowing source [D-40/P-40, D-37/P-37].",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded or are contradicted by the transcript:\n- “Developed symptoms… after returning home on Thursday” is inconsistent with [P-1].\n- “Transcript does not contain any information indicating whether the school has notified the family” directly contradicts [P-39].\n- It introduces irrelevant content about not running outside [P-8] as if it relates to sick contacts, which is a misapplication of the cited line. Overall, several claims are inaccurate/unfaithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address school attendance, sick contacts, and school notifications, but it fails to accurately answer the core question (especially school notification and known contacts inside vs outside school). It also includes an irrelevant tangent about the child not running outside."
