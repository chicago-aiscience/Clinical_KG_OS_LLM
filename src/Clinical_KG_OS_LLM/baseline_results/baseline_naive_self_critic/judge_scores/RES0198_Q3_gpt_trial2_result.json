  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly notes the main symptoms (stuffy/runny nose) for ~1 week and that the doctor assessed this as “most likely a viral infection like the common cold” with expected resolution over “a few weeks” and supportive care [D-39]. However, it inaccurately leans on the symptom being “on and off” as supportive evidence (the patient later clarified symptoms were “pretty constant for the past week” [P-8]). It also implies allergies were “discussed”/a differential in a way not supported by the transcript (the visit includes questions about exposures/allergies, but no explicit allergy-based differential statement).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer evidence largely missing. Included: (a) basic symptom type (nasal congestion/rhinorrhea) and (b) duration (~1 week) and (c) doctor’s statement about typical viral course/supportive care. Missing: (1) absent features supporting viral vs bacterial (no cough, sore throat, SOB, fever/chills, headache, post-nasal drip) [P-4, P-6, P-7, P-14]; (2) discharge quality being mostly clear (argues against bacterial) [P-5]; (3) progression from stuffy to mostly runny [P-3]; (4) allergy-counterevidence (no allergen exposures, no known allergies, no recurrent similar episodes) [P-22, P-28, P-9]; (5) exposure history nuance (daycare contact as plausible viral source) [P-11].",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (symptoms, duration, doctor’s viral assessment, supportive care). Minor ungrounded/interpretive additions include referencing a “knowledge graph” (not in transcript) and suggesting allergy differential was “discussed” as a diagnostic correlation without transcript support. The “on and off” emphasis is selectively taken from [P-1] despite [P-8] stating constant symptoms, making that inference weakly supported.",
    "relevance": "It addresses the general idea of why the doctor thought viral (common cold, supportive care, typical duration), but it does not directly answer the question’s requested comparison (viral vs allergic vs bacterial) using the specific symptom characteristics (clear discharge, absent systemic/lower respiratory symptoms) and exposure history. Thus it is only partially responsive."
