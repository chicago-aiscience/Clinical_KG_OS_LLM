  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually inconsistent with both the Gold Answer and the provided transcript. The transcript clearly includes multiple doctor turns ([D-1] through [D-48]) and explicitly contains the end-of-consultation summary and plan at [D-47]–[D-48]. The Generated Answer incorrectly asserts that only patient turns are present and that the transcript ends at [P-27], which is false. It therefore fails to report the doctor’s actual plan (review the story with supervising doctors), the summary assessment (chronic cough worsened over 3 days, nocturnal awakening, green sputum, no blood, no constitutional symptoms), and what would guide next steps (supervising physician’s assessment after review).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missed: (1) doctor’s end summary of the cough timeline and features in [D-47]; (2) explicit note of no constitutional symptoms; (3) plan to review the story with supervising doctors; (4) implication that next steps depend on supervising physician; (5) no tests/treatments ordered in transcript. The Generated Answer provides none of these, instead claiming the information is unavailable.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims are not grounded in the transcript and directly contradict it, notably: (a) that there are no doctor turns; (b) that the transcript ends at [P-27]. Since the transcript actually includes [D-47]–[D-48] with the needed information, the response is largely fabricated/misread rather than grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response addresses the question only indirectly by stating (incorrectly) that the answer cannot be extracted. It does not provide the requested plan, assessment, or guiding information, so it is largely non-responsive to the user’s question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely incorrect and unfaithful because it wrongly claims the doctor’s statements are missing, and it fails to provide the doctor’s documented plan, assessment, and guidance from the end of the transcript."
