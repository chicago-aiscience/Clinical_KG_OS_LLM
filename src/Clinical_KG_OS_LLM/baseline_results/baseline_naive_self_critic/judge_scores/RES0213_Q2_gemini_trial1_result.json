  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medications used for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and accurately reports their lack of effectiveness. However, it contains a significant factual error regarding routine medications/supplements. It states the patient 'did not report taking any specific over-the-counter medications or supplements for routine maintenance,' which is incorrect as the patient explicitly mentions taking a multivitamin [P-25].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the medications used for chest pain and their effectiveness well. It misses the multivitamin mentioned in the transcript as part of the patient's routine. It also omits the stress management techniques (reading, running) mentioned in the Gold Answer, though these were lifestyle habits rather than medications.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer fails on faithfulness by making a 'hallucinated negative' claim. It asserts that the patient did not report routine supplements, which directly contradicts transcript segment [P-25] where the patient says, 'I take like a multi vitamin but that's it.'",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the question, attempting to address each component (treatments, effectiveness, and routine)."
