  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies the 'infectious exposure source' as the diagnosis (common cold/COVID-19) rather than the source identified in the social history (the nephew in daycare). Furthermore, it incorrectly asserts that the physician's management plan (COVID swab, isolation) was motivated by the patient's diabetes, whereas the transcript shows the doctor linked these actions to the pandemic context, not the chronic condition.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the most critical point from the Gold Answer: the nephew who attends daycare. It also fails to mention that the doctor never explicitly links the patient's diabetes to their immune function or current symptoms, which is a key observation in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a relationship between the patient's diabetes and the doctor's clinical decisions (swab and isolation). The transcript explicitly attributes these steps to the pandemic ('since right now we're in a pandemic'), not the patient's medical history. However, the mention of Tylenol and symptoms is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer fails to address the specific 'social history' component of the question. It treats the question as asking for a general diagnosis and treatment plan rather than identifying the specific exposure source (the nephew) mentioned in the social history section of the interview."
