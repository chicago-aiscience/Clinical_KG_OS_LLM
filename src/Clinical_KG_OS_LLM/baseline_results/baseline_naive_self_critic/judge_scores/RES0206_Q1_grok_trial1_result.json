  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures most facts from Gold Answer, including increased cough, sputum (green yellowy), hemoptysis, dyspnea/SOB, fever, sinus pressure, and cough as most bothersome, all with correct citations. Minor discrepancies: categorizes sinus pressure as respiratory (Gold lists as systemic), simplifies fever report without noting uncertainty or lack of thermometer, omits reduced exercise tolerance and headache; however, core facts remain correct without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: increased cough frequency, increased green yellowy sputum, hemoptysis, worsened dyspnea/SOB, possible fever, sinus pressure, cough most bothersome (7/9). Missed: reduced exercise tolerance [P-4], mild headache [P-14]. Covers approximately 80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All listed symptoms and quotes are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-12, P-9]. No fabricated facts; minor phrasing like 'having a fever' aligns with patient's report of feeling 'really hot' and believing she had one. 'Knowledge graph' mention is extraneous but does not introduce ungrounded claims about symptoms.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by categorizing and listing specific respiratory and systemic symptoms from the 3-day worsening period with citations, identifies the most bothersome symptom, and includes no off-topic content."
