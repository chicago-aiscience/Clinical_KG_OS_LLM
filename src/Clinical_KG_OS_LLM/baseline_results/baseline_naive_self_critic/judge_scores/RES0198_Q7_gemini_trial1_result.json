  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the duration (one week), the first symptom (stuffy nose), and the progression (stuffy to runny). However, it incorrectly concludes that the symptoms were intermittent. While the patient initially said 'on and off' in [P-1], they later explicitly clarified to the doctor in [P-8] that the symptoms had been 'pretty constant for the past week.' The Generated Answer fails to account for this clarification, leading to an incorrect factual conclusion regarding the constancy of the symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most of the prompt's requirements but misses two key details found in the Gold Answer: 1) It omits the mention of over-the-counter decongestants and their potential role in the symptom change [P-10]. 2) It misses the crucial clarification in [P-8] where the patient corrects their initial description of the symptoms as 'on and off' to 'pretty constant.'",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is faithful to the specific segments of the transcript it cites (P-1 and P-3). It does not hallucinate information outside the transcript; however, its selectivity leads to a narrow interpretation of the patient's frequency of symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the timeline, the first symptom, the change in predominance, and the frequency (though the frequency conclusion is flawed)."
