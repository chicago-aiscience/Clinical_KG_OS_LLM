  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for cholesterol and Tylenol for the cough/general symptoms, which is consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer. The patient reports Tylenol 'helps a little bit,' which is accurately captured.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several points included in the Gold Answer: 1) The confirmation that Lipitor is the only prescribed medication. 2) The non-medication relief (clearing 'gunk'). 3) Relevant negative findings such as the denial of drug allergies and the lack of recent cannabis use. While the prompt asks for medications, a complete clinical answer usually includes these negative findings and confirmation of the list's exclusivity.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is grounded in the transcript regarding the medications themselves. However, it references a 'knowledge graph' which is not present in the source text or context provided. This is a minor hallucination regarding the source of the inference, though the clinical link is correct.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific questions asked (medications, conditions, and effectiveness) without extraneous information."
