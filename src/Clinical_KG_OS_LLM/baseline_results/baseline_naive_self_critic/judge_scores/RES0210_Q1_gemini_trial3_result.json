  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the details it provides. It correctly identifies the cough duration, the 'yellow custard' sputum with 'spots of red', the 'right' side chest pain, and the presence of 'chills'. All these details align with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete compared to the Gold Answer and the prompt's specific requirements. It misses the 'quality' of the chest pain (described as 'dull' and 'constant' in the transcript), fails to mention 'fever' despite it being explicitly requested in the prompt, and omits other reported symptoms like mild dyspnea on exertion, sore throat, and resolved runny nose.",
    "faithfulness": "Every claim made in the generated answer is directly supported by the provided transcript and uses appropriate patient-dialogue references.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question but fails to address the multi-part nature of the prompt. By omitting 'quality' of pain and 'fever', it only partially answers the user's specific inquiry."
