  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the COVID swab test, 14-day isolation, and isolation from the younger sister, all matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-44] with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab test [partial, misses 24-48 hour results timing], 14-day isolation specifically from younger sister. Missed: results timing, full household composition (parents and sister), ER precautions (high temp, neurological symptoms, weakness, dizziness, fainting), false-negative possibility and other viral illness, no medications/supportive care/wait for results, mother's acknowledgment, school requirement. Covers core question-specific points (test, isolation duration, specific person) but only ~50-60% of Gold's broader management details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (COVID swab, 14-day isolation due to COVID-like symptoms, isolation from younger sister) are directly verifiable in transcript [D-44]; citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by directly listing the diagnostic test, isolation instructions with duration, and specific household member (younger sister) to isolate from, with no off-topic content."
