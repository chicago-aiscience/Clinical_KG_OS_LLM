  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies 'Anxiety Attacks' as a condition that was 'ruled out', whereas the transcript and Gold Answer suggest the doctor was exploring anxiety/stress as a potential cause for the symptoms. Furthermore, the Generated Answer misinterprets the patient's response in [P-20]; the patient stated heart fluttering occurred during anxiety, but the Generated Answer claims this excluded chest pain as a sporadic symptom. The Gold Answer identifies six distinct categories of conditions ruled out (Injury, Angina, Infection, Asthma, Dyspnea, Arrhythmia), most of which are missing from the Generated Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer only mentions two conditions (Cardiac Issues and Anxiety), failing to include four major categories screened and ruled out according to the Gold Answer: Traumatic/musculoskeletal injury, Infectious/febrile illness, Asthma, and Primary dyspnea. It covers approximately 20-30% of the required information.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes an inference that the doctor used triggers to differentiate cardiac from psychological symptoms, which is not explicitly detailed as a 'ruling out' conclusion in the transcript. More importantly, it misrepresents [P-20] by suggesting it excluded chest pain as a sporadic symptom, when the transcript indicates the patient experiences chest pain while walking or studying (rest), which are independent of the 'anxiety attacks' mentioned in [P-20].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer follows the requested format by listing conditions and lines of inquiry, directly addressing the prompt's structure."
