  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the local site symptoms of redness, tenderness, and localized soreness behind the left knee, and it correctly notes that the doctor screened for joint pain and fever/feeling ill and that the patient denied these. However, it contains a major factual error: it states that the transcript does not indicate the doctor screened for headaches, when the doctor explicitly asked “So no headaches?” [D-19] and the patient denied [P-19, P-20]. Because headache screening/denial is a key part of the question, this substantially reduces correctness.",
    "completeness": "Local symptoms: partially complete—includes redness, tenderness, soreness, and location behind the knee, but omits other key local details from the Gold Answer such as the tick being “stuck pretty good” and explicit denial of a bullseye/target rash (only localized redness without a larger circle). Systemic symptoms: incomplete—includes joint pain and fever/illness screening/denial but omits headaches (and incorrectly claims it was not screened). Overall coverage is roughly in the 50–79% range of Gold Answer points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements about redness/tenderness/soreness and denials of joint pain and fever are directly supported by the transcript. However, the claim that headaches were not screened is directly contradicted by the transcript [D-19–P-20]. Additionally, interpretive phrasing such as the patient denying symptoms by “focusing solely on localized symptoms” is not stated in the transcript. These issues lower faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the asked elements (local bite-site symptoms and screened systemic symptoms). There is some unnecessary narrative (e.g., ‘not too bad’ comparisons), but it remains largely on-topic."
