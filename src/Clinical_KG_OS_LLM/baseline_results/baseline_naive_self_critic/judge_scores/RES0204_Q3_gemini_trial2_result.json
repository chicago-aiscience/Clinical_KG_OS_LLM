  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the transcript and gold answer regarding the primary reasons for the tests: the persistent nature of the cough for the X-ray and the institutional protocol for the COVID swab. It correctly identifies the absence of fever, chills, and chest pain as factors in the decision-making process.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific symptoms mentioned in both the prompt and the gold answer. Specifically, it fails to mention the 'clear nasal discharge' (a present symptom) and the absence of 'sore throat,' 'loss of taste or smell,' and 'muscle aches.' The prompt specifically asked how the combination of *these* findings (including the ones missed) led to the workup. It covers roughly 50-60% of the specific clinical indicators highlighted in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are supported by the transcript. The generated answer correctly references segments such as [P-2], [D-37], and [D-39] to support the rationale for the diagnostic steps. No hallucinations or extra-textual information were introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question. It explains the rationale for both tests and notes the lack of severe findings, which explains why the doctor chose a standard workup rather than an emergency intervention."
