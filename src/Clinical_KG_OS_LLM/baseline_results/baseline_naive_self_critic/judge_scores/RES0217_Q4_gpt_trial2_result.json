  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several absent Lyme features that match the Gold Answer: absence of erythema migrans/bullseye rash (asked at D-6; denied at P-6), absence of joint pain (D-7/P-7), and absence of fever/feeling ill (D-8/P-8). It also correctly lists the proposed evaluations: physical exam, tick species ID at a lab, and bloodwork/serology (all from D-18).\n\nHowever, it contains a clear factual/attribution error: it cites P-14 (“just for my cholesterol”) as implying no systemic illness/fever, but P-14 is about routine medical follow-up and is not evidence about current systemic symptoms. The transcript’s actual support for “no systemic illness” is P-8 and P-18. This weakens factual accuracy/citation quality, though the overall clinical conclusion (no fever/illness) remains correct.\n\nIt also does not mention the doctor screened for headaches (D-19) and the patient denied them (P-19/P-20), which is a key absent feature in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered key absent features: bullseye rash absent; joint pain absent; fever/systemic illness absent.\n\nMissed key absent features from Gold Answer: headache screening/absence (D-19/P-19/P-20) and the explicit “feeling well otherwise/totally fine” (D-18/P-18). It also omitted the “no other bites found” detail (P-9), which the Gold Answer includes (though it is less central to “active Lyme clinical features” than rash/fever/joint symptoms/headache).\n\nDiagnostic tests/proposed evaluation were essentially complete: physical exam, tick identification, and serologic blood work were all included; it did not mention planned consultation with a supervising physician (D-13, D-22) which is included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with correct general direction (rash, joint pain, fever; physical exam, tick ID, serology). However, there is an unfaithful inference/miscitation: using P-14 (cholesterol follow-up) as evidence that the patient was not ill/feverish is not supported by the transcript. This is not a minor wording issue; it is a misuse of a quote and introduces an unsupported rationale (even though the patient elsewhere denies fever/illness). No other major hallucinations were present.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on (1) clinical features assessed and found absent and (2) diagnostic tests proposed to evaluate/exclude Lyme disease. Minor extraneous phrasing (“knowledge graph”) does not materially distract."
