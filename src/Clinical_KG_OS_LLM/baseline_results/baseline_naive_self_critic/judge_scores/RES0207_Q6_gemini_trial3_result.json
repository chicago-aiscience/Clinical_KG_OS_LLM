  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It claims the transcript ends at [P-26], but the provided transcript clearly continues until [D-38]. Consequently, it fails to identify the next steps mentioned in [D-37], which the Gold Answer correctly identifies.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It does not mention the consultation with another doctor, the return of the physician, or the potential for future tests.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant hallucination/error regarding the provided context. It states that there are no doctor responses after [P-26], whereas the transcript contains 12 additional turns (up to [D-38]) including the specific information requested.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer fails to address the question because it incorrectly concludes that the information is missing from the source text."
