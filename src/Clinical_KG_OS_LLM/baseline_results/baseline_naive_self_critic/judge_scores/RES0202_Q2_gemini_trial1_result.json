  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the gold answer regarding the diagnostic test, isolation duration, and the specific family member mentioned for isolation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the specific items listed in the 'including' clause of the prompt (test, isolation, and family member). However, it omits several key 'management measures' detailed in the gold answer, such as the 24-48 hour turnaround for test results, the comprehensive safety-netting/ER instructions (high fever, seizures, fainting), and the discussion regarding false negatives and supportive care.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is directly supported by the transcript and matches the corresponding sections in the gold answer without any hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and addresses the prompt's specific requirements directly, though it focuses more on the examples provided in the prompt than the broader category of 'management measures'."
