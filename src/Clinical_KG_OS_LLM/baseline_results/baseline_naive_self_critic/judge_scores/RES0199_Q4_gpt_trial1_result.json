  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, correctly states that a swab test was ordered, correctly reports the expected turnaround time of 24–48 hours, and correctly names the alternative diagnosis as another viral illness if COVID testing is negative. These points are consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript (all from D-52). No factual errors noted.",
    "completeness": "It covers the core elements asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) swab test, (3) 24–48 hour turnaround, (4) alternative of another viral illness if negative. However, it omits additional items included in the Gold Answer: instruction to isolate for 14 days, public health contact tracing if positive, and supportive management regardless of cause. Because these are present in the Gold Answer (even if not strictly required by the question), completeness is slightly reduced.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript (D-52). It does not introduce new, unverifiable claims. The quoted/paraphrased content aligns with what the doctor said.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what the question asks: condition to rule out, test and turnaround time, and alternative diagnosis if negative. No tangential or irrelevant content."
