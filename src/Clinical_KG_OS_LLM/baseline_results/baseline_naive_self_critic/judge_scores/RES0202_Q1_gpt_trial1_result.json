  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several mother-reported symptoms (dry cough, fever over 100°F, fatigue/tiredness, mild runny nose, possible loss of taste) and notes worsening cough. However, it contains major factual errors regarding what the doctor explicitly asked and what was denied. The transcript clearly shows the doctor asked about wheezing (denied), sore throat (denied), chest pain/heart racing (denied), chills/night sweats (denied), and multiple GI complaints (bowel changes/diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool, nausea/vomiting—denied). The Generated Answer incorrectly claims none of these were explicitly asked. It also incorrectly suggests the neurological symptoms list was asked and only impliedly denied; in fact, dizziness/fainting were explicitly asked earlier and denied, and confusion/memory loss were explicitly asked and denied. These contradictions are substantial.",
    "completeness": "Covers some key positives (cough, fever, fatigue, runny nose, possible taste change), but misses important Gold Answer elements: decreased appetite explicitly stated at P-15 (not just breakfast disinterest), uncertainty about shortness of breath, and nearly all pertinent negatives (no sputum/blood, no wheeze, no chest pain/heart racing, no sore throat, no chills/night sweats, no rash/skin changes, no diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool, no nausea/vomiting, no urinary changes, no dizziness/fainting, no confusion/memory loss; vision/hearing fine). Also fails to note the nuance that swallowing difficulty was uncertain rather than denied.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript and directly conflict with it—especially the claim that wheezing/sore throat/chest pain/chills/GI complaints were not explicitly asked. The added reference to a \"knowledge graph\" is also unsupported by the provided source. While some symptom descriptions are grounded, there are multiple significant unfaithful assertions.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at the question (reported symptoms and explicitly asked/denied symptoms), but a large portion of the key requested content (the specific denied symptoms) is answered incorrectly, limiting usefulness. Still, it remains generally on-topic without major tangents."
