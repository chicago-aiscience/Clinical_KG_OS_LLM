  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly states the clinician’s overall assessment that symptoms are consistent with COVID-19 (supported by D-43), and accurately lists the two diagnostic tests planned: a COVID swab and a chest X-ray (both in D-43). It accurately reproduces the isolation guidance: isolate until results return, and potentially continue isolating even if the test is negative if symptoms persist (D-43). The only minor wording difference is saying the doctor “suspects” COVID-19, whereas the transcript says symptoms are “in line with” COVID-19; this does not materially change meaning in context and does not introduce a factual contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) assessment that symptoms align with COVID-19; (2) COVID swab; (3) chest X-ray; (4) isolate until results; (5) continue isolating if still symptomatic even with a negative test. Missing relative to the Gold Answer: the note that the clinician would consult with the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps (D-1, D-44) and that the patient acknowledged/agreed. These are minor omissions but part of the Gold Answer’s full management-plan narrative.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript, primarily D-43 for assessment/testing/isolation, and P-27 for COPD history. No extra diagnostic tests, treatments, or isolation criteria beyond what is stated are introduced. No hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question by summarizing the doctor’s assessment, planned diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, and the condition for continued isolation after test results. No irrelevant tangents."
