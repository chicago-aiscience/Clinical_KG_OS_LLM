  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core epidemiological factors from the Gold Answer: husband's week-long similar illness (cited correctly [P-19], linked to COVID prioritization [D-53]), limited outside contact (hiking [P-18], no travel), and lack of flu shot (noted but incorrectly cited as [P-27] instead of [P-53]; correct doctor response [D-53/54]). It correctly reflects prioritization of COVID over influenza. Minor discrepancies include interpretive 'rules out imported disease' (plausible but not verbatim Gold) and conclusion matching Gold's emphasis. No major contradictions, but wrong citation and extra symptom details slightly detract.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: husband's symptoms and household transmission suggestion [100%]; limited contact via hiking/no travel [~80%, misses explicit work-from-home [P-23/42], self-isolating [P-22], denied other sick contacts [P-17]]; no flu shot and influenza possibility [100%]; collective shaping of differential (COVID first, flu possible) [100%]. Adds symptoms but covers 80-99% of Gold epi-focused keys.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: husband [P-19/20, D-51/53], hiking [P-18], flu shot inquiry [D-53, P-53], prioritization [D-53/54]. Errors: flu shot wrongly cited [P-27] (actual neck swelling); hallucinates '[KG]' clinical knowledge graph (absent from transcript); 'rules out imported' interpretive but grounded in no travel. Symptoms from [P-1] verifiable. Multiple minor unverifiable/hallucinated elements (wrong cite, [KG]).",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question on epi risks (husband, household/limited contact, no flu shot) shaping COVID vs. flu differential, with structured breakdown mirroring Gold structure. Minor tangent on symptoms and [KG], but focused and on-topic."
