  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor did not systematically explore living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence (e.g., D-45 to D-50 explicitly cover apartment living, environmental triggers, work at car dealership, sick contacts at work, and no travel). This is a complete factual reversal of the Gold Answer's accurate summary.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points (living: apartment alone, environmental triggers denied; sick contacts: possible at work lunchroom; workplace: car dealership, no sick colleagues; travel: none; substance screening) are entirely missed; Generated Answer covers 0% by denying all exploration.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates absence of relevant dialogue (claims 'No dialogue segments referenced asking about travel plans, the workplace setting, or who the patient may have interacted with'), ignoring transcript sections D-45/D-46 (living/environment), D-47/P-47 (sick contacts), D-48/P-48 (workplace), D-49/P-49 (travel), D-50/P-50 (sick at work); its citations (e.g., symptoms, D-52) are accurate but irrelevant to the claim.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by denying exploration of the specified sources (living, workplace, travel, sick contacts) and lists consultation focuses, with only minor tangents on symptoms/diagnosis/management."
