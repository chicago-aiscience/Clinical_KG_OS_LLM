  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major elements of the Gold Answer, including the three diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick to lab, blood work) with correct citations; prophylactic antibiotics due to tick attachment time; planned consultation with the supervising physician; and preventive advice on ticks in long grass/woods-fields, waving motion, and insecticide. Minor discrepancies include not explicitly mentioning geographic risk (Strathroy [D-13]) as a factor for antibiotics and slight interpretive additions like 'to review the results' or 'colleague or specialist' not directly in Gold or transcript.",
    "completeness": "All key points covered: diagnostics (physical exam [D-18], tick lab [D-6,D-18], blood serology [D-18]); treatment (prophylactic abx for >72h [D-6], implied safety [D-18], no specifics); consultation (talk to doctor [D-18,D-22], physician look [D-13]); preventive (long grass/woods-fields, waving legs, insecticide for garden [D-18]). No points missed, 100% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (primarily D-18, D-6); tick specimen reference aligns with [P-1]; minor unverifiable details include 'to review the results' (implied but not stated) and 'colleague or specialist' (plausible for context but not explicit), but no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question's components (diagnostic tests lab/physical, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice on garden/outdoor), with no off-topic content or tangents."
