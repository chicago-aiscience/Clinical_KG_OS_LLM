  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Tylenol, Advil, and Alka-Seltzer as the medications used for chest pain and accurately notes that they were ineffective. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating the patient 'did not report taking any specific over-the-counter medications or supplements for routine maintenance.' The patient explicitly stated in [P-25] that they take a daily multivitamin.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the medications used for chest pain and their effectiveness (50-60% of the Gold Answer). It misses the routine multivitamin and the additional context provided in the Gold Answer regarding lifestyle habits like stress management (reading and running).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the transcript in its claim that no routine supplements were mentioned. The statement 'they did not report taking any specific... supplements' is directly contradicted by the patient's statement in [P-25]: 'I take like a multi vitamin but that's it.'",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to answer the prompt's categories, although the content within the routine maintenance section is inaccurate."
