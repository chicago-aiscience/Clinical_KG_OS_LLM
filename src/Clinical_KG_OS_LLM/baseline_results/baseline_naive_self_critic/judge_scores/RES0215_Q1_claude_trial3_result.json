  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three main respiratory symptoms (wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough) mentioned in P-1. However, it adds 'difficulty breathing (difficulty taking in deep breaths)' as a fourth separate symptom, when this is actually part of the shortness of breath/breathing difficulty complex rather than a distinct symptom. The identification of wheezing as the earliest symptom is correct and matches the Gold Answer. The citations are accurate. One minor error is treating 'difficulty taking deep breaths' as a separate fourth symptom rather than recognizing it as part of the breathlessness presentation.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points but misses several details from the Gold Answer: (1) it doesn't mention the 'quite out of breath' description with playing tag [P-3], (2) it omits the characterization of episodes where she 'slightly has a hard time catching her breath' [P-32], (3) it doesn't mention the denial of cyanosis ('it's not like she turns blue'), (4) it doesn't note that the cough was non-productive with no phlegm [P-31], and (5) it doesn't mention that the child 'looks fine otherwise' [P-9]. The answer covers approximately 60-70% of the key details present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations [P-1] and [P-2] are accurate. The interpretation that wheezing came first is correctly derived from the mother's statement 'has been quite wheezy...for the past four five days and now she has a slight cough,' which implies temporal sequence. No hallucinated content is present. The answer stays grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: what respiratory symptoms were reported and which was earliest. It provides a clear structured response with evidence. The organization into 'Reported Respiratory Symptoms' and 'Earliest Symptom' sections shows good focus. There is no irrelevant content, though the level of detail could be enhanced to match the clinical depth of the Gold Answer."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main respiratory symptoms and accurately determines wheezing as the earliest symptom with appropriate citations. However, it misclassifies 'difficulty taking deep breaths' as a separate fourth symptom rather than part of the breathing difficulty complex, and omits several clinically relevant details present in the Gold Answer, including activity-related breathlessness, episode characterization, cyanosis denial, non-productive cough, and overall appearance. The answer is fully grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations and maintains excellent relevance to the question."
