  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the bronchodilator as the only asthma medication, used as-needed for acute relief, and administered as an inhaler (synonymous with 'puffer' in transcript). It accurately notes the doctor inquired about a daily controller medication the patient lacks. Minor discrepancies: cites [P-1] for inhaler/administration (actual confirmation in P-7/D-7 'puffer'); assumes the daily controller is specifically an 'inhaler' (transcript D-5 does not specify form, just 'every day no matter what'). Core facts align with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: sole medication (bronchodilator), as-needed use, administration (inhaler/puffer), doctor asked about daily controller (patient denies having). Misses explicit multiple denials of other meds (D-6/P-6, D-30/P-30), exact phrasing 'every day no matter what', and clinician restatement (D-6). Includes extras like triggers [P-9] not central to question. Covers ~85-90% of essentials.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: bronchodilator [P-1], increased use [P-1/P-9], no other meds implied, daily question [D-5/P-5]. Citations accurate for usage. Minor issue: 'inhaler' for bronchodilator ok ('puffer' [P-7]); but 'controller inhaler' hallucinates form (transcript unspecified). No major fabrication, plausible in asthma context.",
    "relevance": "Directly structured around question parts (medication/administration, missing daily controller). Minimal tangents (brief usage notes relevant to context). Perfectly focused on query."
