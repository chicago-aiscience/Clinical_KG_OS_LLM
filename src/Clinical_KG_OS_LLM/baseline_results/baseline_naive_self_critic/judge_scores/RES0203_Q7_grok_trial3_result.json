  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that all symptoms began approximately two days prior and occurred concurrently/simultaneously, aligning with Gold [P-1, P-2, P-6]; no worsening or fluctuation is accurately reported, matching Gold [P-5, P-8]; and no prior similar symptoms, consistent with Gold [P-3]. Minor discrepancies include not explicitly confirming cough onset at the exact same time via [P-6], lack of detail on partial sensory loss persistence [P-4], and imprecise citations (e.g., attributes consistency solely to [P-1] instead of specific later exchanges). Core facts are correct, no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: simultaneous onset of all three symptoms (general timeframe and concurrency), no worsening/fluctuation over duration, no prior history. Missed or partially covered: specific confirmation cough started same time [P-6], 'pretty consistent' quotes for sensory [P-5] and cough [P-8], no intermittent/variable detail, partial nature of losses persisting [P-4], doctor's COVID note [D-39]. Covers ~70% of key points (main structure yes, but lacks nuanced details and specifics).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in transcript (e.g., 2-day onset [P-1/P-2], concurrency [P-1/P-6], consistency [P-5/P-8], no prior [P-3], mild [P-1]). No hallucinations. Minor issue: citations overly reliant on [P-1] for later-confirmed details (e.g., fluctuation evidence in [P-5/P-8]), but claims verifiable elsewhere; accurate overall.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question elements: relative onset timing, worsening/fluctuation, prior experience. Structured response directly mirrors query with no tangents or off-topic content."
