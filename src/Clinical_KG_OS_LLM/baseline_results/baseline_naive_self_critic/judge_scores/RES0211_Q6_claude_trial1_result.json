    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer. The GA incorrectly states the doctor's summary is 'not included in the text' when it is explicitly present in D-58. The GA fails to identify the systematic recap structure the doctor provided. It incorrectly interprets Jessica's statement about having Claritin 'just in case' as her treatment goal, when the Gold Answer correctly identifies P-60 where Jessica explicitly states she wants to know 'if I have to like take medicine or something.' The GA misses key elements from the doctor's summary including fever, lack of sputum production, brother's cold, absence of asthma, and the framing of 'next steps.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions the dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, and feeling unwell, but omits: (1) the fever; (2) no sputum production; (3) brother's cold two weeks ago; (4) no asthma; (5) only taking Claritin medication-wise; (6) the doctor's explicit framing of 'next steps and where to go from here'; (7) Jessica's explicit goal statement in P-60; (8) Jessica's desire to go home and rest (P-61); (9) the impact on her functioning. Most critically, it fails to identify that the doctor DID provide a summary in D-58.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple claims not supported by or contradictory to the transcript. Most problematically, it states 'the doctor's explicit summary is not included in the text' when D-58 clearly contains the summary. The interpretation that Jessica's goal is merely 'to address her current symptoms' and that having Claritin 'just in case' suggests seeking treatment is not directly verifiable in the transcript and contradicts her explicit statement in P-60. The GA also fabricates the idea that she wants to 'obtain treatment' when she specifically asks if she 'has to' take medicine, which is a different framing.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question by attempting to identify clinical findings and Jessica's goal, but it fundamentally fails by not recognizing the doctor's summary in D-58. The GA provides some relevant symptom information but includes irrelevant details about allergy shots and misses the actual goal statement. About 50% of the content is relevant to answering what the doctor recapped and what Jessica's goal was, but the core finding (that the summary IS in the transcript) is wrong."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fails to identify the doctor's explicit summary in D-58, incorrectly claiming it is 'not included in the text.' This is a fundamental error that undermines the entire response. While the GA does mention some clinical findings (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, feeling unwell), it omits critical elements from the doctor's recap: fever, no sputum production, brother's cold, absence of asthma, and the systematic nature of the review. Most importantly, the GA misidentifies Jessica's primary goal, incorrectly inferring it from her mention of having Claritin, rather than citing her explicit statement in P-60 that she wants to know 'if I have to like take medicine or something.' The response demonstrates significant issues with correctness, completeness, and faithfulness to the source material."
