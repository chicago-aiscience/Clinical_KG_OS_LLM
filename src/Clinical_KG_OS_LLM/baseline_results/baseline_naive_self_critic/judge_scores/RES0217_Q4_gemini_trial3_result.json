  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core clinical features (rash, joint pain, fever) and diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick identification, blood work). However, it misattributes several patient responses. For example, it cites [P-1] and [P-14] as the sources for the absence of rash and fever, whereas the Gold Answer correctly points to the direct denials in [P-6] and [P-8]. [P-14] refers to the patient's cholesterol medication, not a direct denial of acute illness symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention 'headaches,' which were specifically assessed in [D-19] and denied. 2) It misses the assessment of other bites on the patient/husband [P-9]. 3) It misses the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician [D-13, D-22]. It covers approximately 60-70% of the key clinical and diagnostic details.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript, but it exhibits a logic error by citing the patient's cholesterol history [P-14] as the primary evidence for the absence of current fever, rather than the direct denial in [P-8]. It also conflates the patient's initial description in [P-1] with the later specific screenings.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question (clinical features and diagnostic tests)."
