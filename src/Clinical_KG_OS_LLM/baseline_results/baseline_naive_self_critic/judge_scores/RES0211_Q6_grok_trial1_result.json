  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer precisely details the doctor's recap in D-58, listing five specific key clinical findings: (1) 3-4 day dry cough with fever and headache; (2) no sputum; (3) no recent sick contacts except brother's cold 2 weeks ago; (4) no asthma; (5) no meds except Claritin. The Generated Answer falsely claims 'the doctor's explicit summary is not included in the text,' directly contradicting the transcript and Gold Answer. It instead recaps patient-reported symptoms (e.g., dry cough, headache from P-1) and history (allergies), not the doctor's summary. Jessica's goal is misstated as generally addressing symptoms and treatment with Claritin inference, not her exact words ('if I have to like take medicine or something' from P-60). This results in mostly incorrect content contradicting the Gold Answer. Score: 1",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers doctor's 5 recap points, Jessica's exact goal from P-60, and P-61 context. Generated Answer covers none of the doctor's specific recap points (attributes symptoms to patient reports, not D-58; ignores contacts, asthma, etc.); vaguely mentions dry cough duration and allergies/Claritin but not as recapped by doctor; infers goal loosely without quoting P-60. Covers <20% of key points. Score: 1",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims no doctor's summary exists (hallucination, as D-58 is explicit); symptoms like dry cough (P-1,P-4), headache (P-1), tired (P-13), allergies/Claritin (P-15-16,P-25) are verifiable in transcript. However, goal inference ('obtain treatment... Claritin just in case') loosely ties to P-25 but ignores direct P-60 statement and fabricates absence of summary; multiple hallucinated elements about structure and content. Score: 2",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on doctor's end-of-visit summary findings and Jessica's primary next-steps goal; Generated partially addresses clinical findings and goal but via wrong source (patient reports vs. doctor's recap), includes off-topic history details, and denies key transcript element. Partially relevant with off-topic content. Score: 3"
