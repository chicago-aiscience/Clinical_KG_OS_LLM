  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer by stating there is no clinician dialogue and that the text consists exclusively of patient responses. In reality, the transcript clearly contains multiple clinician turns (D-1 to D-44), including the plan elements: a COVID swab (D-29), possible medication change (D-43), and going to talk to the supervising doctor and returning (D-29, D-43, D-44). It also introduces unsupported/incorrect details (e.g., calling goldfish a trigger and mentioning PCR vs antigen), none of which appear in the transcript or Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements missed:\n- Diagnostic test: COVID swab due to the pandemic (missed).\n- Medication plan: suggestion of a change to better control asthma; context that patient only has rescue bronchodilator and increased use; goal of sports without frequent medication (missed).\n- Consultation plan: trainee will talk to supervising doctor, present everything, then return shortly (missed).\nInstead, the response provides an unrelated symptom summary and speculative management ideas, covering essentially none of the requested plan components.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple ungrounded or false claims relative to the transcript:\n- False: claims transcript contains only patient responses and no clinician recommendations.\n- Unverifiable/speculative: discussion of “knowledge graph,” PCR vs antigen, adding inhaled corticosteroids, and goldfish as an asthma trigger.\nThese issues indicate the answer is largely not grounded in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The question asks for the clinician’s overall plan (COVID swab, medication change suggestion, and consultation/return plan). The Generated Answer mostly avoids providing that plan, asserts it cannot be determined, and shifts into tangential symptom/triggers discussion. It is only marginally related to the question and does not supply the requested specifics."
