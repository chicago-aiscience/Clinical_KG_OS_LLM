  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s chronic medication (matches Gold/transcript at P-23). For the missed dose, it accurately quotes that the patient forgot to take the medication (P-9), but it does not provide the *specific circumstance* (daughter’s birthday/altered dinner routine) that the question asks for. This is not a direct factual error, but it is an under-specified response compared with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points:\n- Keppra prescribed for epilepsy: COVERED.\n- Missed dose acknowledged: COVERED (generic forgetting).\n- Specific circumstance: daughter’s birthday celebration; took med with dinner but routine changed/no usual dinner so forgot: MISSED.\n- Context that it was an isolated lapse vs ongoing adherence issue: MISSED.\nOverall, it captures the medication and only a generic reason for missing the dose, omitting the specific circumstance required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (Keppra at P-23; forgot med at P-9). No hallucinated details are added.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the two items asked (current medication and reason for missed dose) with no irrelevant tangents, but it fails to supply the requested specificity for the second item."
