  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer suggests 'Conversion Disorder,' which is a clinical over-reach compared to the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' Conversion Disorder typically involves motor or sensory deficits, whereas chest pain is better categorized as a somatic symptom or anxiety-related. Additionally, the Generated Answer incorrectly states the patient has felt this pain before as an anxiety attack; the transcript [P-17] explicitly says she has never felt this pain before. It also references a 'knowledge graph' which does not exist in the provided context.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50% of the Gold Answer's key points. It correctly identifies the history of anxiety, current academic stress, and the situational/social context. However, it misses the patient's specific respiratory symptoms (breathing faster due to nervousness), the patient's own suspicion of stress, and the extensive list of pertinent negatives (lack of fever, asthma, or exertional worsening).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer suffers from significant hallucination and misinterpretation. It repeatedly refers to a 'knowledge graph' to support its claims, which is not part of the source transcript or prompt. It also misinterprets [P-20] regarding the heart fluttering during past anxiety attacks, applying that history to the current chest pain, which contradicts [P-17].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly addressing the question of diagnosis and clinical observations, though the content itself is flawed."
