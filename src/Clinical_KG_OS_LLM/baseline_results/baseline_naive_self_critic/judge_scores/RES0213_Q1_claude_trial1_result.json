  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that chest pain occurs 'only during episodes of anxiety attacks' (referencing P-20), when the transcript clearly shows the patient distinguishes between current chest pain episodes and past anxiety attacks. The patient states the pain occurs when alone, walking, or studying - not during anxiety attacks. The answer also omits critical correct information about pain resolution when engaged with others and pain occurring at rest.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only about 40% of key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies quality (sharp/strong), deep breath trigger, and 20-minute duration. However, it completely misses: the 'uncomfortable/odd' initial description, the intermittent nature ('here and there'), pain occurring specifically when alone/walking/studying, pain resolving when engaged with others/at school, pain occurring at rest, no worsening with exercise, no prior injury, and no previous occurrence. The most critical omission is the situational pattern of occurrence versus resolution.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major hallucination that fundamentally misrepresents the transcript. It claims pain occurs 'only during episodes of anxiety attacks' based on P-20, but P-20 actually states the opposite - that heart flutter occurs 'only if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack...but not any other time.' The patient is discussing palpitations during past anxiety attacks, not current chest pain. This is a severe misreading that contradicts the actual clinical presentation described throughout the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant but includes a major irrelevant/incorrect focus. While it addresses the question about pain characteristics (quality, duration, situations), it fundamentally mischaracterizes the situational pattern by focusing on anxiety attacks rather than the alone-versus-engaged pattern. The treatment response information, while from the transcript, is tangential to the specific question asked about pain characteristics and situational patterns."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error that fundamentally misrepresents the patient's clinical presentation. It incorrectly states the chest pain occurs only during anxiety attacks, when the transcript clearly shows the pain occurs when the patient is alone (walking, studying) and resolves when engaged with others. This appears to be a misreading of P-20, which discusses past anxiety-related palpitations, not current chest pain episodes. The answer correctly identifies some basic characteristics (sharp quality, deep breath trigger, 20-minute duration) but misses most key situational details and the crucial occurrence-versus-resolution pattern that defines this presentation. The hallucinated connection to anxiety attacks severely undermines the clinical accuracy of this response."
