  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is mostly factually accurate compared to the Gold Answer: it correctly identifies the three diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick lab ID, blood work for Lyme serology) with accurate citations; prophylactic antibiotics as treatment with correct reasoning (72+ hours) and citation; physician consultation plan with relevant citation; and all preventive advice points. Minor discrepancies include not mentioning geographic risk (Strathroy [D-13]), trainee-supervised context [D-13,D-22], tick specimen detail [P-1], and specific quotes like 'safer than not' [D-18]; additionally, 'knowledge graph provided' is erroneous as none exists in the source. Core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: all diagnostic tests (physical exam [D-18], tick to lab [D-6,D-18], blood work [D-18]); prophylactic antibiotics due to time attached [D-6] (misses geographic risk [D-13] and quotes [D-13,D-18]); physician consultation (covers [D-18], misses fuller [D-13,D-22] and trainee inference); all preventive advice (long grass/woods-fields, waving legs, insecticide [D-18]). Misses minor details like bite site specificity and no abx specifics, but covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [D-6,D-13,D-18]; physical exam contextually for bite; preventive details exact. Minor unverifiable: 'knowledge graph provided' (hallucinated, no such in source); 'assess the condition' plausible; consultation 'colleague or specialist' interpretive but grounded in 'the doctor' context. No multiple hallucinations, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around the question's categories (diagnostic tests lab/physical, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice on garden/outdoor), uses transcript citations, no off-topic content, perfectly focused."
