  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies the exposure source from social history as the nephew who attends daycare and lives with the patient, a plausible route for respiratory viral transmission even if the nephew is asymptomatic. The Generated Answer instead labels the “common cold”/COVID-19 as the exposure source, which is not an exposure source obtained from social history and does not answer what was asked. It also implies the patient’s diabetes influenced isolation guidance; in the transcript isolation is recommended due to pandemic/COVID-rule-out, and the Gold Answer notes no explicit linkage to immune risk was discussed.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered vs missed:\n- Missed: Nephew who attends daycare and lives with patient as the potential exposure source.\n- Missed: Daycare as a common reservoir for respiratory viral infections and that lack of nephew symptoms doesn’t exclude transmission.\n- Partially covered: Patient has type 1 diabetes (mentioned), but did not include key contextual details from Gold (dx age 7, on insulin, sees endocrinologist) and did not note that the transcript does not explicitly connect diabetes to immune risk.\n- Added: Focus on common cold/COVID differential and management advice, which is not the main asked exposure-source point.",
    "faithfulness": "Most management statements (viral URI assessment, COVID swab, isolate until results, hydration, OTC meds) are supported by [D-39]. However, the answer’s framing that the exposure source was identified through “symptoms and physician’s analysis” (rather than social history) departs from the transcript’s social-history exposure detail, and the suggestion that isolation is recommended “given… the patient’s chronic condition” is not stated in the transcript (the transcript attributes isolation to COVID concern/pandemic context).",
    "relevance": "The response stays on the general topic of infection and diabetes, but it does not directly answer the specific question about the infectious exposure source identified in the social history (daycare-attending nephew). It therefore only partially addresses the prompt."
