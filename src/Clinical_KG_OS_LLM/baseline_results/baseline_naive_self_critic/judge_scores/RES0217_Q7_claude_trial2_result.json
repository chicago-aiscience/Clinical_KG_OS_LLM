  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key facts from the Gold Answer. The timeline is correctly described with hiking on Friday, gardening on Saturday, and discovery 'earlier today.' The 72-hour estimate and prophylactic antibiotic discussion are accurate. The comparison between episodes correctly identifies the bullseye rash and 'quite swollen' tick from 10 years ago versus the current 'maybe a little bit' swollen tick and localized redness without bullseye rash. All major facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer. It includes: the Friday hiking/Saturday gardening timeline, uncertainty about when tick attached, discovery process, 72-hour estimation, plastic container detail, prior bullseye rash, antibiotic treatment history, and engorgement comparison. However, it omits some specific details present in the Gold Answer such as: the Strathroy location, the specific description of 'little grape' imagery, the exact quote 'I don't really know when I got it,' and the hope it wasn't from her garden. These are relatively minor omissions but do represent some incompleteness.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1], [D-6], [P-3], [P-6]. All claims can be verified against the source material. The patient's statements about symptom location, redness, tenderness, prior rash, and tick engorgement are all accurately referenced. No hallucinated information is present. The answer appropriately uses direct quotes and paraphrases from the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both components of the question: (1) the timeline from hiking through discovery and presentation, and (2) the comparison of current versus prior episode symptoms and tick characteristics. The response is well-organized with clear section headings that map to the question structure. No irrelevant information is included, and all content serves to answer the specific question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-grounded response to the question, correctly capturing the timeline of tick exposure and the comparison between current and prior episodes. It faithfully represents information from the transcript with proper citations and maintains strong relevance throughout. The only minor weakness is incompleteness, as it omits some specific details present in the Gold Answer such as the Strathroy location and certain direct quotes, though all essential information is covered. The answer demonstrates strong clinical documentation with clear organization and no factual errors or hallucinations."
