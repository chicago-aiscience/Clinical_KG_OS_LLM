  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses the specific durations provided in the transcript. While it correctly identifies the sequence, it states the COPD diagnosis was 'a couple years ago' (based on P-1) while the patient later clarifies it was 'five years ago' (P-2). It also fails to mention the 10-year duration of the cough (P-3), settling for 'a while'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific 10-year duration for the cough, the clarified 5-year duration for the COPD diagnosis, and the mention of chills occurring in the last couple of days.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is faithful to the transcript as far as the sections it cites (P-1), but it demonstrates a failure to incorporate later clarifications in the dialogue (P-2, P-3). It does not hallucinate information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for a timeline, though it lacks the precision found in the Gold Answer."
