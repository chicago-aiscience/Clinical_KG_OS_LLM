{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All items stated in the Generated Answer align with the Gold Answer and transcript: the patient is on an unspecified statin for cholesterol [P-15]; the doctor discussed starting prophylactic antibiotics due to likely prolonged attachment time [D-6]; and the patient previously took antibiotics for a prior tick bite with a bullseye rash [P-3]. No incorrect drug names, dosages, or unsupported specifics were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core medication/treatment elements (current statin; proposed prophylactic antibiotics; past antibiotics for prior tick bite). However, it omits several additional discussed management steps present in the Gold Answer: sending the tick for species identification, possible bloodwork/serology, the plan to consult the supervising physician before finalizing, and environmental prevention advice (consider insecticide).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims made are directly supported by the transcript segments cited. No apparent hallucinated medications, doses, or durations. The phrase “knowledge graph” is not grounded in the transcript but does not add clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications and treatments discussed in the consultation, specifically addressing current statin therapy and the new prophylactic antibiotic plan for the tick bite."
