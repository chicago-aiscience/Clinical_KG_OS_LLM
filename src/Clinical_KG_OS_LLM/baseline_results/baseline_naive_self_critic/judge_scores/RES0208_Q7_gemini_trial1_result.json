  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer regarding the core symptoms and their timing. It correctly identifies the onset of shortness of breath and fatigue, the occurrence of subjective fever yesterday, and the loss of taste this morning.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several symptoms included in the gold answer and transcript: 1) Body aches (P-20), 2) Diminished sense of smell (P-6), 3) Sore throat (P-9), and 4) Mild headaches (P-11). While it captures the primary symptoms, it omits about 30-40% of the minor clinical details present in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript with specific references to the patient's dialogue [P-1, P-3, P-4, P-8, etc.]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's request for a reconstructed timeline, categorizing symptoms clearly by their time of emergence."
