  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer matches several core facts from the Gold Answer: 2-week persistent cough, transition from earlier mucus to current dry cough, initial sore throat and runny nose that resolved, and chest discomfort associated with coughing.\n\nHowever, there are notable inaccuracies/overstatements:\n- It cites [P-2] for “dry cough,” but [P-2] only states cough duration; dryness is established in [P-5]/[P-6].\n- It labels “Chest Pain” as a current symptom; the patient explicitly denied chest pain and described mild soreness only after coughing a lot [P-15, P-16]. This is a nuance error that could mislead clinically.\n\nOverall, the main symptom narrative is correct but with minor factual/misattribution issues.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements included:\n- Persistent cough for two weeks.\n- Earlier mucus/productive phase then dry cough.\n- Initial sore throat and runny nose/“flu symptoms” resolving.\n- Chest soreness with excessive coughing.\n\nKey elements missing from the Gold Answer:\n- Timeline specificity (e.g., mucus for first 4–5 days; sore throat 2–3 days; most symptoms resolved by day 3–4).\n- Ongoing cough characteristics: approximate frequency (3–4 times/hour), spontaneous/no triggers, stable intensity/frequency.\n- Pertinent negatives explicitly denied: no dyspnea, no fever, no nausea/vomiting, no abdominal pain.\n\nGiven these omissions, coverage is partial rather than near-complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (cough duration, mucus earlier, dry cough now, sore throat/runny nose initially, chest soreness after coughing).\n\nFaithfulness issues:\n- Mis-citation/overreach: linking “dry cough” to [P-2] (not supported by that line).\n- “Chest pain” wording overstates what the patient said (soreness only after coughing).\n- Reference to a “knowledge graph provided” is not supported by the prompt/transcript.\n\nThese are limited but real departures from strict grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the patient’s symptoms and separates current vs resolved symptoms, which directly addresses the question. Minimal extraneous content."
