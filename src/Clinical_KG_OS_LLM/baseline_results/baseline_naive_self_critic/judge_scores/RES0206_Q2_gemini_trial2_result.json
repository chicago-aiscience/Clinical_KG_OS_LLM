  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It falsely claims that the frequency of inhaler usage is not mentioned, whereas the transcript (P-26) explicitly states one is used 'every day' and the rescue inhaler is used 'once every two weeks.' It also fails to provide the patient's reasoning for not taking antihypertensive medication, claiming the transcript doesn't indicate a reason, while P-23 clearly states she decided to try lifestyle changes first and her blood pressure is currently 'OK.'",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific usage frequency for both inhalers, the specific lifestyle strategies used for hypertension (weight loss and walking), and the patient's explicit explanation for avoiding medication. It only identifies that she uses puffers and has high blood pressure without the requested detail.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a form of negative hallucination by asserting that information is missing from the transcript when it is actually present (frequencies and reasoning). It does not ground its claims in the available dialogue regarding management strategies.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address all parts of the question, its utility is severely limited because it concludes that the specific answers to the frequency and reasoning components are unavailable, which is incorrect."
