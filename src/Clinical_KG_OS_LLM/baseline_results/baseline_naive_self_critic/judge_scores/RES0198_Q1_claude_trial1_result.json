  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It correctly identifies the stuffy and runny nose symptoms and the clear discharge character. However, it makes a critical error in stating that 'the provided transcript segments do not contain explicit verbal denials' of symptoms like cough, sore throat, loss of taste/smell, etc. The transcript clearly shows the patient explicitly denied these symptoms (P-4: No cough, P-7: No sore throat/shortness of breath/fevers/chills, P-16: No loss of taste or smell). This is a major factual error that contradicts the Gold Answer and the source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the stuffy/runny nose symptoms, the clear discharge, and the denial of post-nasal drip. However, it completely misses or incorrectly handles the explicit denials of cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, fevers/chills, and loss of taste/smell - which are central to answering the question. It also omits the mild fatigue and additional pertinent negatives (headache, nausea, chest pain, etc.) mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is partially grounded in the transcript but contains a significant hallucination. The claim that 'the provided transcript segments do not contain explicit verbal denials' of cough, sore throat, loss of taste/smell, etc. is false. The transcript clearly shows these denials in P-4, P-7, and P-16. The citations for the nasal symptoms and their character are accurate, but this major error about the denials represents unfaithful representation of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is partially relevant. It addresses the nasal symptoms and discharge character components of the question well. However, it fails to properly address the third component about 'which related symptoms were explicitly denied' - instead incorrectly claiming such denials don't exist in the transcript. This represents a significant failure to fully address a key part of the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy and runny nose) and the clear discharge character, but contains a critical factual error by claiming the transcript does not contain explicit denials of related symptoms when it clearly does (cough, sore throat, loss of taste/smell, etc. were all explicitly denied). This error affects correctness, completeness, and faithfulness. The answer partially addresses the question but fails to properly document the explicitly denied symptoms, which was a key component of the question."
