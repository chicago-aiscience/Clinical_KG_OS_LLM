  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It states the child developed symptoms after returning home on Thursday, while the transcript (P-1) says he came home on Wednesday and developed a cough that night, staying home on Thursday. Crucially, it claims the transcript contains no information about school notification of exposures, which is directly contradicted by P-39 where the mother states, 'they haven't like contacted us about anything.'",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the school's COVID testing requirement for returning to school (P-41), and it misses the contextual exclusion of other sources (no recent travel, no environmental issues at home). It also fails to capture the mother's certainty that there were no sick contacts outside of school ('we know for sure').",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a lack of information by stating the transcript does not mention school notification. This information is clearly present in turn P-39. It also inaccurately interprets turn P-8 as a response to sick contacts when that turn actually discussed the child's activity levels and potential shortness of breath.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in its structure, as it attempts to address every specific component of the user's multi-part question, even though the content provided is factually incorrect."
