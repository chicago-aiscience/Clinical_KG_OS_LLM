  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error by claiming the transcript lacks explicit denials for symptoms like orthopnea, PND, palpitations, and hemoptysis. In reality, the patient explicitly denies these in turns P-9, P-10, P-14, and P-7. Additionally, it omits chest discomfort and chills as endorsed symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is incomplete. It misses several symptoms endorsed by the patient (chest discomfort and chills) and omits almost the entire list of pertinent negatives provided in the Gold Answer. Most notably, it fails to provide the specific denials requested by the prompt, incorrectly stating they were not discussed.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source transcript in its claim that denials are not present. The doctor asks specifically about these symptoms and the patient provides 'no' responses. Claiming these aren't in the transcript is a hallucination of absence.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in its structure, attempting to address all three parts of the prompt (endorsed symptoms, sputum change, and denials), but the content within those sections is flawed."
