  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the transcript. The transcript clearly shows the doctor systematically screening for and documenting multiple negative findings (fever [D-10, P-10], difficulty breathing [D-11, P-11], headaches [D-12, P-12], sore throat [D-13, P-13], chills/night sweats [D-14, P-14], muscle aches [D-15, P-15], chest pain [D-22, P-22]). The Generated Answer incorrectly states 'there were no negative findings documented' and that 'the doctor did not screen for these specific symptoms,' which is factually wrong.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question entirely. It covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer, which listed 9 specific negative findings with transcript citations and explained their clinical significance. Instead, it incorrectly focuses only on positive findings and denies the existence of the review of systems that was clearly documented.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript. It claims the doctor did not screen for fever, dyspnea, or sore throat, when the transcript explicitly shows these questions being asked and answered negatively in exchanges D-10/P-10, D-11/P-11, and D-13/P-13. This represents a fundamental misreading or hallucination about what is present in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the actual question asked. The question specifically requested a list of negative findings from the review of systems and an explanation of how their absence informed the clinical picture. Instead, the answer incorrectly denies these findings exist and discusses only positive findings, making it largely irrelevant to the question posed."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect and fails to address the question. It falsely claims that no negative findings were documented and that the doctor did not screen for symptoms like fever, dyspnea, or sore throat, when the transcript clearly shows systematic screening for all these symptoms with documented negative responses. The answer covers none of the key points from the Gold Answer, contradicts verifiable information in the transcript, and does not address what was actually asked. This represents a complete failure across all evaluation dimensions."
