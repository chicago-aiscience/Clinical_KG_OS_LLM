{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment that symptoms align with COVID-19 (paraphrased as 'suspects COVID-19' from [D-43]), mentions COPD from transcript, lists exact tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray) with correct citations, and precisely quotes/paraphrases isolation instructions including the condition for continuation if symptomatic even if negative. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: assessment linking symptoms to COVID-19, two specific tests, isolation until results and condition for continued isolation (symptoms persist even if negative). Missed: detailed rationale for chest X-ray (breathing issues + COPD), 'heads up' framing, consulting supervising physician and returning for next steps, patient acknowledgment. Covers ~85-90% of Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly grounded in transcript: COVID suspicion and tests/isolation from [D-43], COPD from [P-27]; direct quote used for isolation condition. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's elements (assessment, management plan, specific tests, isolation instructions, and conditions for continued isolation) with no off-topic content."
