  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- The main conclusion (asthma exacerbation/worsening rather than a new condition) aligns with the Gold Answer.\n- Correctly identifies dry cough (P-1), shortness of breath (P-1), and wheezing (P-15) as present.\n- Incorrectly states chest tightness is not explicitly cited; chest tightness is clearly endorsed by the patient (P-20).\n- Does not accurately report the key quantitative change in bronchodilator use (from once every ~2 weeks to 5–6 times/week, P-8), instead using vague phrasing (“a lot now”).\n- Introduces “Knowledge Graph” as evidence; this is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer support and is therefore not factually grounded in the provided source.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points vs Generated Answer:\n- Covered: dry cough; shortness of breath; wheezing; some trigger association (exercise/cold); implies bronchodilator helps.\n- Missing/insufficient: chest tightness (present in transcript and central to question); explicit asthma history/known diagnosis since age 8; the dramatic quantified SABA increase (P-8); wheezing occurs more often than bronchodilator use (D-17/P-17); systematic exclusion of infectious features (no URI, no sick contacts, no fever, no anosmia, no travel, etc.); absence of productive cough.\n- Includes family history (P-32), which is true but not a key Gold Answer justification.\nOverall, it captures less than half of the Gold Answer’s supporting elements.",
    "faithfulness": "- Several statements are grounded in the transcript with correct citations (P-1, P-15, P-9, P-11, P-32).\n- However, it contains ungrounded content (“Knowledge Graph directly links…”, “Knowledge Graph establishes…”), which is not in the transcript.\n- It also makes a demonstrably false transcript-related claim that chest tightness is not explicitly cited.\nThese issues reduce faithfulness substantially.",
    "relevance": "- Largely addresses the question by attributing the symptom cluster and increased bronchodilator use to worsening asthma.\n- Minor tangents (repeated “Knowledge Graph” framing; family history) and omission of key requested elements (chest tightness + quantified bronchodilator increase) keep it from being fully responsive."
