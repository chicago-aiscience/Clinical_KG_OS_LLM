  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies stuffy nose first 'just before' fever, sore throat around fever onset and ongoing, fever for 3 days, muscle aches concurrent with fever (2-3 days). Generated correctly identifies stuffy nose first, fever for 3 days, mentions sore throat ongoing and muscle aches, but implies sore throat and muscle aches as subsequent after fever rather than concurrent/around onset (minor discrepancy). Husband's timeline: Gold notes ~4 days before patient's fever; Generated notes past week vs 3-day fever (approximately correct, core fact intact). No major errors, minor timing nuances differ.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Stuffy nose first (covered). 2) Sore throat around fever onset, ongoing (partially: ongoing noted but timing as subsequent). 3) Fever 3 days after stuffy nose (covered). 4) Muscle aches concurrent 2-3 days (partially: mentioned but timing as subsequent). 5) Husband similar symptoms past week (~4 days before patient's fever, covered approximately). 6) Ongoing similar symptoms (covered). 7) Staggered onset/household transmission note (implied but not explicit). Covers ~85% of key points, misses precise timings and transmission inference.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: stuffy nose 'just before' fever [P-1], fever 3 days [P-1], sore throat [P-1], muscle aches past 2-3 days [P-13,P-14], husband similar symptoms past week [P-19,P-20]. Citations accurate. No hallucinations; 'subsequently mentioned' for muscle aches reflects conversation order, timing grounded in patient's report. Fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around patient's symptom chronology (first stuffy nose, then fever/sore throat/muscle aches) and husband timeline comparison, perfectly matching question without off-topic content."
