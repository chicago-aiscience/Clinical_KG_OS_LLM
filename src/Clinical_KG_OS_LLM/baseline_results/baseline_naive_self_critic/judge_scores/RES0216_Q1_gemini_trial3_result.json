  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms present (chest tightness, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, phlegm, and throat clearing). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the denied symptoms. It explicitly claims that the transcript does not contain denials for fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating, whereas the transcript clearly shows the patient denying these in turns P-6, P-12, P-13, P-14, and P-15.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to list the majority of the 'explicitly denied' symptoms requested by the prompt and included in the Gold Answer. It misses fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating. It only covers two out of eight specifically requested denied items.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer suffers from a 'negative hallucination' or grounding failure. It claims information is missing from the source transcript when it is actually present. This results in a lack of faithfulness to the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in its structure and attempt to answer the multi-part question. It specifically addresses the categories of respiratory, upper airway, and chest-related complaints, though it fails on the 'denied symptoms' list execution."
