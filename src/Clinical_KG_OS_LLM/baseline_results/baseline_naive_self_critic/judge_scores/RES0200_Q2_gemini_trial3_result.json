{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the respiratory medications (Ventolin, Spiriva), the non-respiratory medication (Torva Staten), and the discontinued medication (blood pressure medication/diuretic). Minor spelling differences ('Ventilin' vs 'Ventolin') follow the transcript's phonetic spelling.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses the specific numerical frequency of Ventolin use. The question explicitly asked 'how frequently had the patient used Ventolin in the past week', and while the Gold Answer notes 'approximately 10 times', the Generated Answer only provides a qualitative description ('a lot more recently').",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using direct quotes and correct references (e.g., [P-11], [P-38]). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is perfectly relevant, structured to address each part of the multi-part question directly without including unnecessary information."
