  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect regarding the source text. It claims there is 'no evidence' that the doctor asked about weight loss, travel, sick contacts, or chemical exposure. However, the transcript explicitly contains these questions: D-22 (weight loss), D-23 (travel), D-24 (sick contacts), and D-34 (chemical exposure).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address any of the four specific points requested in the prompt. While it provides an analysis of other symptoms (cough, chills, chest pain), it completely misses the analysis of the differentials associated with the requested categories because it incorrectly assumes the data is missing.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It hallucinates an absence of information that is clearly present in the provided text. It ignores specific segments (D-22 through D-34) that directly address the user's prompt.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is not relevant to the specific question asked. By claiming the required information does not exist, it bypasses the prompt's core requirements and provides an unsolicited analysis of other symptoms instead."
