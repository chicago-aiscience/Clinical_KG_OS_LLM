  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It states the cough has been present for 'maybe a month' based on [P-19], but this reference actually discusses sleep disruption duration, not cough onset. The Gold Answer correctly identifies the cough started 3 months ago [P-2, P-13]. The Generated Answer also incorrectly claims 'no information available' about fevers, when [P-4] clearly states the patient felt 'hot at night in the past couple days.' The timeline is fundamentally wrong.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses critical timeline components from the Gold Answer: (1) initial onset 3 months ago at pole dancing class, (2) intermittent dry cough for ~2 months, (3) nightly sleep disruption starting 1 month ago, (4) productive cough with greenish sputum starting 3 days ago, and (5) subjective fevers in the last couple days. It only partially addresses sleep disruption and sputum character, missing most key temporal markers.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major hallucination. It claims 'no information available' about fevers when [P-4] explicitly documents subjective fevers ('I've been feeling like hot at night in the past couple days'). It also misinterprets [P-19] to mean total cough duration rather than sleep disruption duration. The citation usage is inaccurate and misleading.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question's timeline structure but fails to properly trace the complete progression requested. It acknowledges the question's components (onset, sleep disruption, productive sputum, fevers) but provides incomplete or incorrect information for each. The organization follows the question's framework but lacks the temporal precision required."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates severe deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It fundamentally misidentifies the cough onset as 1 month rather than 3 months ago, misinterprets transcript references, and falsely claims no information exists about fevers when it's clearly documented in [P-4]. The answer captures only fragments of the timeline (sleep disruption, sputum character) while missing the critical temporal progression that defines the clinical presentation. Major hallucinations regarding fever documentation and incorrect citation interpretation significantly undermine faithfulness to the source material."
