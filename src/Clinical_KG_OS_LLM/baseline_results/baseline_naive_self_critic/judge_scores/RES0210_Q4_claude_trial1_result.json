  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims the doctor did NOT ask about weight loss, travel, sick contacts, or chemical exposure, which directly contradicts the Gold Answer and transcript. The transcript clearly shows these questions in [D-22], [D-23], [D-24], and [D-34]. The Generated Answer then provides an alternative analysis that was not requested. This is factually incorrect.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the actual question asked. It does not discuss the differential diagnoses screened by the four specific questions (TB, lung cancer, infectious exposures, chemical pneumonitis, etc.). Instead, it provides an irrelevant alternative analysis. Covers 0% of the required key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a major factual error by claiming questions were NOT asked when they clearly appear in the transcript ([D-22], [D-23], [D-24], [D-34]). This represents a significant failure to accurately represent the source material. The alternative analysis provided references real transcript elements but addresses the wrong question entirely.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer completely fails to address the specific question about what differentials were screened by the four specific questions (weight loss, travel, sick contacts, chemical exposure). Instead, it provides an unsolicited alternative analysis of other symptoms. This is entirely off-topic regarding the actual question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally fails the evaluation by incorrectly claiming the doctor never asked the four questions specified in the prompt, when the transcript clearly shows these questions were asked ([D-22], [D-23], [D-24], [D-34]). This factual error invalidates the entire response. Instead of analyzing the differential diagnoses screened by these specific questions (TB, lung cancer, Legionella, chemical pneumonitis, etc. as detailed in the Gold Answer), the Generated Answer provides an irrelevant alternative analysis. The response demonstrates poor faithfulness to the source material, zero completeness regarding required content, and complete irrelevance to the actual question asked."
