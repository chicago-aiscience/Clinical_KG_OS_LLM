  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately cites nasal symptoms (stuffy on/off and runny for 1 week, stuffy first then mostly running), clear discharge [P-5], and explicit denials (cough [P-4], post-nasal [P-6], sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills [P-7], loss taste/smell [P-16]). Generated Answer correctly identifies stuffy (on/off) and runny nose for 1 week but inaccurately states runny was 'mostly run since the beginning' (contradicts P-3: stuffy first). Misses 'mostly clear' discharge entirely (key fact from P-5). Incorrectly claims no explicit denials for cough, sore throat, etc., despite direct 'No' responses in P-4, P-7, P-16 (significant contradictions to transcript and Gold).",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: stuffy nose on/off [P-1,P-2], runny nose [P-1,P-2], progression stuffy first now running [P-3], clear discharge [P-5], denied cough [P-4], post-nasal [P-6], sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills [P-7], loss taste/smell [P-16]. Generated covers stuffy on/off and runny for week (~30%), partial progression (but wrong), misses clear discharge entirely, covers only post-nasal denial vaguely (~1/7 denials), no fatigue mention needed but irrelevant. Covers ~20-40% of keys.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about nasal symptoms mostly verifiable [P-1,P-3] but misinterprets progression as runny since beginning (P-3 says opposite). No mention of 'clear' despite direct question [D-5,P-5]. Hallucinates 'no explicit verbal denials' for cough/sore throat/etc. (directly contradicted by P-4 'No', P-7 'No', P-16 'No'); cites questions but ignores patient 'No' responses. Multiple inaccuracies and fabricated absence of denials.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response into 'Specific Nasal Symptoms', 'Character of Nasal Discharge', 'Explicitly Denied Symptoms' matching question components; no off-topic content, fully focused despite factual flaws."
