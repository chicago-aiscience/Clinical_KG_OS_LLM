  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the nature of the cough (productive vs. non-productive) is not specified, when the transcript clearly shows it was characterized as a dry/non-productive cough [D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6]. It also incorrectly claims nasal discharge was not reported, when the patient explicitly confirmed having a runny nose for the past couple of days with clear discharge [D-11, P-11, D-12, P-12]. These are major omissions of key information directly asked about in the question.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 20-30% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the cough and its duration but completely misses: (1) the dry/non-productive nature of the cough with explicit denial of sputum production, (2) the runny nose as a second respiratory symptom, (3) the clear appearance of nasal discharge, (4) the timeline difference between symptoms, (5) the stability of cough severity, and (6) pertinent negatives. Two major symptoms requested in the question are inadequately or incorrectly addressed.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript by claiming information is not present when it clearly is. The statement that the nature of the cough is not specified is directly contradicted by [D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6]. The claim that nasal discharge appearance is not reported contradicts [D-11, P-11, D-12, P-12]. While it doesn't fabricate information, it incorrectly represents what is absent from the transcript, which is a form of unfaithfulness to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question by identifying the cough symptom and its duration. However, it fails to adequately address two of the three main components requested: the nature of the cough (productive vs. non-productive) and nasal discharge characteristics. Since the question specifically asks about these characteristics and the Generated Answer incorrectly claims they are not reported, the relevance is significantly compromised."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It incorrectly claims that critical information about cough nature and nasal discharge is not present in the transcript when this information is explicitly stated. The answer identifies only the cough symptom with its duration but completely fails to characterize it as dry/non-productive despite clear evidence in the transcript. It also entirely misses the runny nose with clear discharge, which is the second respiratory symptom explicitly requested in the question. These major omissions and factual errors result in an answer that covers less than 30% of the required content and contradicts the source material by claiming absence of information that is clearly present."
