  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms (headache, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of smell) and the doctor's reasoning for ruling out COVID-19. It accurately identifies 'loss of smell' as the characteristic symptom mentioned by the patient, matching the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the Gold Answer, such as 'fatigue' as part of the symptom combination and the list of pertinent negatives (no fever, no runny nose, etc.) that the doctor used to narrow down the diagnosis. It also omits the doctor's specific mention of 'another viral illness' as an alternative.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript. However, it references a 'knowledge graph' and 'loss of taste' to support its conclusion; while medically accurate, there is no knowledge graph provided in the source text, and the patient only confirmed a loss of smell, not taste. This is a minor hallucination of external data sources.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question without unnecessary fluff."
