  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details family history (father's heart attack last year in 50s, sees heart doctors, scares her; grandpa accident), smoking (started 18, 10/day last 2 yrs, now 5/day, hard to quit), stressors (thesis deadline, living alone, nervous running), connections (might be stress, nervous breathing, past anxiety). Generated covers family accurately (heart attack last year, scares her), smoking details match, stressors cover school busy and anxiety but miss thesis specifics/living alone/running/nervous breathing/past anxiety returning; adds 'knowledge graph' not in gold but core facts consistent; minor discrepancies from extras/misses. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Covers: family (main points, misses heart doctors/grandpa details); smoking (100%); stressors (school/anxiety, misses thesis crunch/living alone/running ~50%); interactions (stress links, self-doubt on heart). ~80-90% key points. Score: 4.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript citations (P-8,14,13,20,3) accurate and verifiable; claims like family scares her, smoking history, stress from school/anxiety grounded; however, multiple 'knowledge graph' references (e.g., [FAMILY_HISTORY]--[CAUSES]-->stress, stress--[TRIGGER]-->chest pain) are entirely fabricated/not in transcript; some plausible but hallucinatory structure. Score: 3.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three factors (family, smoking, stressors), their contributions/interactions/concerns, with transcript details; summary ties together; no tangents. Score: 5."
