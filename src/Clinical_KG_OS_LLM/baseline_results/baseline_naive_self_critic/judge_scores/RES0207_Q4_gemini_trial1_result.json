  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fundamentally fails to address the question. It lists symptoms that the patient confirmed (shortness of breath and cough) rather than the symptoms and exposures the patient denied (chest pain, faintness, GI symptoms, URI symptoms, travel, etc.). It also characterizes the patient's uncertainty about the seizure as a 'denial,' which is clinically inaccurate in the context of a review of systems/negative findings.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention chest pain, faintness, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, and diarrhea. It also omits the gastrointestinal differential diagnosis category.",
    "faithfulness": "While the answer mentions facts found in the transcript (shortness of breath, cough, seizure), it misrepresents them as 'denied' symptoms or uses them to explain 'denials' in a way that is not grounded in the clinical screening process described in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely irrelevant because it focuses on the positive symptoms the patient presented with rather than the negative findings (denials) and the differential diagnoses those specific negative findings were intended to rule out (like GI or cardiac causes). International travel and sick contacts are not mentioned at all despite being key 'exposures' requested by the prompt. It only addresses two differentials (cardiac and infectious) and misses the logic of the screening process for the others (GI)."
