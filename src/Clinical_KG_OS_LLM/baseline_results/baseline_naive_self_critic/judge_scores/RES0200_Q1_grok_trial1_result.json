  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer partially captures endorsed SOB and worsening cough with citations [P-1, P-8], and sputum change [P-6], but misses key details like cough triggered by minimal exertion [P-5], chest discomfort [P-13], chills [P-29]; incorrectly presents medical history (high cholesterol, BP meds [P-33, P-34]) as systemic symptoms; significantly errs on denials by claiming no explicit denials for orthopnea [P-9 'no'], PND [P-10 'no'], hemoptysis [P-7 'no'], palpitations [P-14 'no'], fever (implied denial [P-29-30]), contradicting Gold and transcript—significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: worsening cough/SOB [partial], sputum change [partial]; missed: cough triggers [P-5], chest discomfort [P-13], chills [P-29], no fever measured [P-30], all pertinent negatives (hemoptysis, orthopnea, PND, palpitations, and extended list); covers ~20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded with accurate citations (e.g., SOB [P-1,P-8], cough [P-1], sputum [P-6], history [P-33,P-34]); however, claim of 'no explicit denials' for orthopnea/PND/etc. is unverifiable and false as direct 'No' responses exist [P-7,9,10,14]; sputum baseline slightly misquoted ('clear to yellow or white' vs. transcript 'clear to yellow. Sorry clear to white'); mislabels history as symptoms; some plausible but erroneous interpretations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around endorsed respiratory symptoms (SOB, cough), sputum change, and attempts denials as per question; minor irrelevant inclusion of medical history as 'systemic symptoms'; no major off-topic content."
