  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the duration of the cough (4-5 days), its persistent nature, the rationale provided by the doctor for the chest X-ray, and the institutional protocol for the COVID-19 swab.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but is slightly less comprehensive than the gold answer regarding the list of pertinent negatives. It omits the clear nasal discharge (in the body of the explanation), the lack of sore throat, the preservation of taste and smell, and the lack of sick contacts/travel history, all of which were detailed in the gold answer to explain the diagnostic reasoning.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All cited points (cough duration, CXR reasoning, COVID protocol, and absent symptoms like fever/chills) are directly supported by the provided dialogue segments [P-2, D-37, D-39, P-13, P-28].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the question by explaining how the persistence of the cough led to the X-ray and how the presence of respiratory symptoms triggered the standard COVID-19 screening protocol despite the absence of severe symptoms."
