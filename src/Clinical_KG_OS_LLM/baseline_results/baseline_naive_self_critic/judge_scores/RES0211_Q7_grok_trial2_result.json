  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly state the chronological order of symptoms, but [P-4] explicitly says 'I first noticed that my throat was kind of scratchy and then I started coughing'; it also wrongly claims no mention of feeling hot, contradicting [P-7] 'I have felt really hot' and [P-9] details of constant heat day/night; ignores headache [P-1,P-2], malaise [P-1,P-14], fatigue [P-13], and progression, directly contradicting Gold Answer's accurate summary.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3-4 days [covered partially]; initial scratchy throat then dry cough [missed, denied]; headache, malaise, fatigue [missed]; persistent hot feeling day/night [missed, denied]; no exact heat onset but same illness [missed]; doctor summary fever [missed]; progression from airway to systemic [missed]. Covers <20% (only vague duration of cough/throat).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims no explicit order despite [P-4] 'first noticed throat... then coughing'; hallucinates absence of hot feeling despite [P-7,P-9]; [P-1] citation accurate but overall multiple unverifiable denials of transcript content; ignores broader symptoms verifiable in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question on symptom order/progression over 3-4 days and hot sensation timeline; no irrelevant content or tangents, purely focused on transcript analysis for the query."
