  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies that symptoms started ~1 week prior and that congestion (stuffy nose) came first with a shift to predominantly rhinorrhea (\"now it's mostly running\"). However, it incorrectly concludes the symptoms were intermittent, stating \"on and off\" indicates intermittent and using that as the final frequency. This contradicts the later direct clarification that symptoms have been \"pretty constant for the past week\" [P-8]. It also implies both stuffy and runny nose began at onset, whereas the transcript supports congestion first and later more running.",
    "completeness": "Includes: 1-week onset; first symptom = stuffiness; progression to mostly runny. Missing/underweighted: the key constant-vs-intermittent clarification (it chooses intermittent and omits the constant report); the nuance that initial \"on and off\" was later revised/clarified; lack of improvement as the reason for visit; and the possible influence of decongestants on symptom change.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in cited lines. The main issue is the asserted interpretation that symptoms are intermittent overall; while \"on and off\" appears in [P-1], the transcript later explicitly states the symptoms have been \"pretty constant\" [P-8]. By presenting intermittent as the overall pattern without acknowledging [P-8], the answer is not fully faithful to the complete transcript context.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the requested timeline elements (onset, which symptom first, how predominance changed, and constancy/intermittence), though it answers the constancy component incorrectly."
