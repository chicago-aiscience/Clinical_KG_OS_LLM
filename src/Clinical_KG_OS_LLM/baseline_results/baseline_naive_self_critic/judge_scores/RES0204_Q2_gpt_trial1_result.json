  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two proposed diagnostic procedures: chest X-ray (doctor “might want to do a chest X Ray… get a better look” [D-37]) and a COVID swab [D-39]. It also correctly states the rationale for the COVID swab as being done for anyone presenting with these symptoms lately (standard screening/protocol) [D-39]. No statements contradict the Gold Answer. Minor wording differences (e.g., “examine the lungs”) are consistent with the intent of “get a better look at what’s going on there.”",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) chest X-ray proposed; (2) COVID swab proposed; (3) rationale for swab as routine testing for anyone with these symptoms. Points not included from Gold Answer: the more detailed explanation that an X-ray is “like taking a picture of your body on the inside” [D-39], the noted discomfort/reassurance about the swab, and the “arrange for these things… return with the doctor” next-step plan. It also does not explicitly restate that the patient was taking no medications (though the question premise supplies this). Overall, it captures the core asked elements but not all supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. However, the phrase “based on… knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript and is an extraneous (unverifiable) source claim. Also, “to examine the lungs” is a reasonable inference but not explicitly stated verbatim (the transcript says “get a better look at what’s going on there”). These are minor faithfulness issues; the central content is supported.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested items: proposed diagnostic procedures and the specific rationale for ordering the COVID swab. No major irrelevant tangents."
