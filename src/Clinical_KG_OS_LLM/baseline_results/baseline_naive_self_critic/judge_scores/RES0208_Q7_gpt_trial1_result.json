  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly places the main initial symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue/rundown, weakness, decreased appetite) as beginning “a couple of days ago,” and correctly identifies subjective fever as “yesterday” and loss of taste as “this morning.” However, it incorrectly handles the “just emerging” symptoms: it conflates cough and sore throat, and appears to misattribute the sore-throat response [P-9] to cough. In the transcript, cough is only “maybe starting” and “on its way” [P-7, P-8], while sore throat is separately “starting to feel a little bit” [P-9].",
    "completeness": "Key points from the gold answer that are missing or inadequately captured include: diminished smell/possible anosmia [P-6]; generalized body aches/overall achy (onset not clearly specified) [P-20, P-21]; mild headache not clearly different from baseline [P-11, P-12]; and explicit identification of sore throat as a newly emerging symptom [P-9]. The generated answer covers the major early symptoms plus subjective fever and loss of taste, but omits several other symptoms and mislabels the emerging throat/cough features.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (SOB, fatigue, weakness, appetite, subjective fever, loss of taste). However, the answer’s section on emerging symptoms is not fully faithful: it introduces “dry throat sensation (pre-cough)” as a distinct symptom when the transcript frames dryness as part of the developing cough description [P-8], and it incorrectly cites/uses [P-9] (sore throat) as evidence about cough. These issues reduce grounding/accuracy of attribution.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured around the requested timeline (onset vs yesterday/this morning vs just emerging) and stays focused on symptom evolution without irrelevant tangents."
