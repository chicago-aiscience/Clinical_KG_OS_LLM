{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated end-of-visit plan in D-37: (1) listen to heart and lungs and do a quick physical exam, then (2) go get the doctor they are working with, (3) review what was discussed, and (4) return to discuss where to go from here. No contradictory or incorrect facts relative to the Gold Answer are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that ARE covered: auscultation of heart and lungs; quick physical exam; consult supervising/working-with doctor; review discussion; return to patient to discuss next steps. Key points that are NOT covered: the plan being foreshadowed at the start (D-1); the patient’s agreement (P-37); the explicit note that no diagnosis/meds were provided and the encounter ends before findings/treatment. Overall coverage is strong but not exhaustive of the Gold Answer’s added contextual points.",
    "faithfulness": "All elements stated in the Generated Answer are supported by D-37. The phrasing that the 'colleague would review' is a minor inference from 'I'll...go over everything you talked about' but remains consistent with the transcript and does not add new clinical actions or facts.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on what was asked: the stated plan at the end, the specified physical exam components, and the process for determining next steps. No meaningful tangents."
