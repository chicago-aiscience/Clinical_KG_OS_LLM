  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes that BOTH patient (P-1: 'in case I have covid') and doctor (D-39, D-2) identified COVID-19 as needing to be ruled out. Generated Answer only attributes identification to the doctor (D-39) and adds an irrelevant note about Type 1 diabetes (P-23) not needing to be ruled out, which is factually true but misses the patient's explicit concern. Test (swab), turnaround (48 hours), and main instructions match perfectly. Minor discrepancy on 'both' aspect, core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: COVID-19 by both (P-1, D-2, D-39), swab today (D-39), 48 hours (D-39), isolation/not see others (D-39), further public health instructions (D-39). Generated covers: COVID by doctor (D-39), swab (D-39), 48 hours (D-39), isolation/not see others (D-39). Misses patient's identification (P-1), 'today' for test, public health instructions, and some citations/context. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated verifiable: COVID/swab/48h/isolation from D-39; diabetes from P-23. Citations accurate. No hallucinations; diabetes note is grounded though extraneous.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer around question elements (condition, test, time, instructions) with bullet points. Minor irrelevant tangent on diabetes, but overall focused and addresses query."
