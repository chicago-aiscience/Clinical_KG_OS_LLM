{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with both the source transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the activities (hiking on Friday, gardening on Saturday), the location (behind the left knee), the 72-hour window mentioned by the doctor, and the detailed comparison with the tick bite from 10 years ago regarding the rash, engorgement, and antibiotic treatment.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers almost all key points. It includes the timeline of activities, the uncertainty of the exact attachment time, the method of presentation (plastic container), the 72-hour estimate, and the symptom/engorgement comparison. It misses a few minor details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific location of the hike (Strathroy) and the explicit mention that discovery occurred 'earlier today'.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript. The citations [P-1], [D-6], [P-3], and [P-6] are correctly used to anchor the information. There are no hallucinations or external information added beyond what was discussed in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address the two parts of the prompt: the timeline of exposure and the comparison to the previous episode. It avoids unnecessary information about cholesterol or family members, focusing strictly on the tick exposure."
