  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly continues past [P-26] and includes the end-of-consultation next steps at [D-37] and [D-38]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies that the clinician said they would review the case with the doctor working that day, return shortly, and discuss possible tests and how to move forward. The Generated Answer wrongly claims it is not possible to answer and that the transcript ends at [P-26].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses essentially all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) reviewing information with the doctor working today, (2) collaborative decision-making involving another physician, (3) returning shortly to discuss next steps, (4) mentioning possible tests and deciding how to proceed, (5) noting no specific tests/treatments were ordered yet, and (6) closing/farewell. It provides none of these and instead states no further content exists.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not grounded in the provided transcript. It asserts the transcript ends at [P-26] and that there are no doctor responses after [P-26], which is directly contradicted by the provided transcript that includes [D-27] through [D-38]. This is a major faithfulness failure (fabricated/incorrect characterization of the source).",
    "relevance": "While it nominally addresses the question by discussing whether next steps can be determined, it does not actually answer what next steps were communicated, despite that information being present. This makes it only minimally relevant to the user’s request."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is incorrect, incomplete, and unfaithful to the transcript because it wrongly claims the transcript ends early and therefore fails to report the clearly stated next steps in [D-37]-[D-38]."
