  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately summarizes: ~1.5 weeks onset, quality evolves from uncomfortable/odd to sharp strong pain on deep breath, 20-min intermittent episodes, occurs alone (walking/studying), resolves with social engagement/activities, at rest, no exercise worsening, no injury, first episode. Generated matches quality ('sharp/strong'), deep breath trigger, 20-min duration. However, major error: claims pain 'only during anxiety attacks' citing [P-20], but P-20 refers to heart fluttering/palpitations, not chest pain—significant contradiction. Misses onset duration, accurate occur/resolve situations, exercise, injury. Significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1.5wks onset, quality details, 20min intermittent, occur alone/walking/studying/rest, resolve social/hands-on, no exercise worsen, no injury, first time. Generated covers: quality (partial), deep breath, duration episodes. Misses: onset, detailed occur/resolve (wrongly anxiety-only), rest/exercise, injury, first time. Adds treatment/context not core to Gold. Covers ~30-40% (quality, duration, trigger).",
    "faithfulness": "Quality [P-3], duration [P-6/7], deep breath [P-3], treatment [P-6], stress [P-8/13] grounded. But 'only during anxiety attacks' [P-20] hallucinates—P-20 is about palpitations ('heart flutter'), not chest pain; misattributes. Fabricates exclusivity to anxiety despite transcript describing pain in studying/walking contexts unrelated to attacks. Multiple unverifiable/misleading claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around quality, duration, situations per question; adds relevant trigger/context/treatment. Wrong situations bullet detracts but overall focused on characteristics without major off-topic digressions."
