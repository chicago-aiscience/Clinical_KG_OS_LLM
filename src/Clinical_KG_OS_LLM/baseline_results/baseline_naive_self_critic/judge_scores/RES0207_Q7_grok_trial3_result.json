  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the seizure occurring the previous night due to missed Keppra (consistent with Gold [P-8,P-9]), sudden SOB and dry cough upon waking in the morning (Gold [P-1,P-2,P-4]), and decision to seek care due to uncertainty (Gold [P-1]). However, it inaccurately categorizes ongoing Keppra treatment under 'Evening Before' events, omits the birthday celebration as the specific reason for missing the dose (Gold [P-24]), does not mention feeling fine after seizure and going to bed (Gold [P-8]), and includes no reference to the 3-hour symptom onset or temperature check, leading to minor discrepancies but core timeline facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: seizure last night (partial, misses 'fine after and bed'), missed Keppra as cause (partial, misses birthday detail), sudden SOB and dry cough morning onset, decision to seek care unsure. Missed entirely: daughter's birthday celebration disrupting routine [P-24], ~3 hours before consultation [P-11], temperature check 37.4°C morning [P-5,P-6], never experienced SOB before [P-3], uncertainty about seizure relation [P-8]. Covers ~40-50% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like seizure night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], missed Keppra [P-9], SOB onset [P-1], dry cough [P-4], decision to seek care [P-1] are verifiable. However, 'knowledge graph provided' and '[PRECIPITATING_FACTOR]' are not in the transcript (hallucinated references); categorizing current Keppra use as 'Evening Treatment' is a stretch; family history under 'During Consultation' is verifiable [P-26] but not a clinical event in timeline. Multiple hallucinated elements present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly reconstructs a timeline addressing seizure, respiratory onset, and decision to seek care, structured chronologically from evening before to morning/consultation; minor off-topic additions like knowledge graph, ongoing treatment details, and family history during consultation."
