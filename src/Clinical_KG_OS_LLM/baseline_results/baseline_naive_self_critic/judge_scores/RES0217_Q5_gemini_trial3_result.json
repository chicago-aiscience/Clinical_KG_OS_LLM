  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the logic for the 72-hour attachment duration based on the Friday/Saturday timeline mentioned in segments [P-1] and [D-6]. However, it incorrectly states that there is no evidence of the doctor discussing the 'Ontario Lyme disease distribution map' or using Strathroy's position to justify treatment. This directly contradicts segment [D-13] of the transcript, where the doctor explicitly mentions the map and identifies Strathroy as a 'concerning point.'",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first part of the question regarding the 72-hour duration calculation. It fails to provide the reasoning for the second part of the question, instead claiming the information is missing from the source text. It covers approximately 50% of the key points compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant 'hallucination of absence.' It claims the transcript does not reference the geographic map or the justification based on Strathroy's location, even though these details are clearly present in segment [D-13].",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in that it attempts to address both parts of the prompt, but the second part of the response is unhelpful because it erroneously claims the data is unavailable."
