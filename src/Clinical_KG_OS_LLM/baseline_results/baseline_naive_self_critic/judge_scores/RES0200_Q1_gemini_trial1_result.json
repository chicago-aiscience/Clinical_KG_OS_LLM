  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error: it claims that the transcript does not contain explicit denials of orthopnea, PND, palpitations, or fever. However, the transcript shows the patient explicitly denying these (P-9 for orthopnea, P-10 for PND, P-14 for palpitations). It also misses endorsed symptoms like chest discomfort (P-13) and chills (P-29).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, specifically the chest discomfort, chills, and the extensive list of pertinent negatives (orthopnea, PND, hemoptysis, palpitations, etc.) which were requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness by claiming that the patient's discussion focused 'strictly on their worsening respiratory distress' and that no explicit denials exist, which is a hallucination/misinterpretation of the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to address each specific part of the prompt (symptoms, sputum, and denials), even though the content provided in those sections is largely incorrect or incomplete."
