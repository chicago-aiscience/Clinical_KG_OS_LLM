    "completeness": "The generated answer covers approximately 90% of the key points. It misses the specific mention of blood pressure monitoring for kidney health mentioned in [D-37] and the 24-48 hour timeline for COVID results, both of which were included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, using direct quotes and correct turn references [D-52, P-11] for all listed interventions and tests.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the question, providing a clear, structured list of the management plan components requested."
