  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: it completely omits the major symptom of difficulty breathing (prominently reported in P-7 to P-11); misclassifies loss of smell as a 'reported symptom' when the patient explicitly denied it (P-19) while reporting reduced taste instead (which is also omitted); incorrectly claims the patient did not explicitly deny cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, or chest pain despite clear 'No' responses in P-15, P-16, P-17, P-18, P-23; partially covers sore throat and fatigue/muscle aches but lacks details like timelines and progression. Core facts are contradicted on key symptoms and denials.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: sore throat (partial, misses worsening and full details), fatigue/muscle aches (partial), swallowing difficulty (as part of sore throat). Missed entirely: difficulty breathing (with all details), reduced sense of taste (with details), full denial list (cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell, fever, chills/night sweats). Covers roughly 20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims are mostly verifiable where cited (e.g., sore throat in P-2, fatigue/muscle in P-25), but hallucinates loss of smell as reported (P-19 is denial); falsely asserts no explicit denials for cough etc. despite direct 'No' responses (P-15-P-18); omits breathing difficulty despite clear transcript evidence (P-7-P-11); plausible but erroneous interpretation of 'explicit denial' leads to multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around reported symptoms and explicit denials of screened symptoms, using the transcript evidence, with minor misplacement (e.g., loss of smell under reported) but overall focused on the question."
