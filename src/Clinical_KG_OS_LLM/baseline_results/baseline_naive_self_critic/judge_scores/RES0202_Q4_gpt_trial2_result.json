    "correctness": "Gold Answer: the doctor said **asthma** would be added to the differential **if the child had cough/SOB without fever**, and the **presence of fever** led the doctor to favor infection and not pursue asthma in the current workup.\n\nGenerated Answer instead identifies the condition as “another viral illness” and frames the workup as COVID vs viral illness, which is not what the question asks and contradicts the doctor’s explicit statement in [D-45] about asthma. While it mentions fever and dry cough, it incorrectly uses them to justify excluding “another viral illness” in favor of COVID testing; the transcript does not state that non-COVID viral illness is excluded, only that it’s possible ([D-44]). Overall, the key condition (asthma) is wrong and the reasoning about exclusion is wrong.",
    "completeness": "Key elements in the Gold Answer:\n- Condition that would be added if presentation differed: **asthma** (explicit in [D-45])\n- Counterfactual presentation: **cough or SOB without fever** ([D-45])\n- Specific finding excluding/prioritizing away from asthma now: **fever** ([P-1], [P-2], [D-45])\n- Optional supporting points: no wheeze and unclear SOB ([P-7], [P-8])\n\nGenerated Answer misses the main condition (asthma) and the counterfactual framing, and does not correctly explain why asthma was deprioritized. It provides unrelated content about “another viral illness” and COVID swab rationale. Coverage of required points is minimal.",
    "faithfulness": "Some cited facts are in the transcript (fever reported; dry cough; doctor mentions possible other viral illness and COVID swab). However, multiple claims are not supported:\n- Calling “another viral illness” the condition that would have been added to the differential if presentation were different is not stated.\n- Claiming the COVID swab workup “thereby excluding the viral illness as the immediate focus” is not supported; [D-44] explicitly keeps “another viral illness” as a possibility.\n- Reference to “knowledge graph information” is extraneous and not grounded in the transcript.\nOverall, there are multiple unsupported inferences, though not every detail is fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically: (1) what condition the doctor would have added **if presentation were different** and (2) what **specific finding in this case** led to excluding that condition from the current workup. The answer does attempt a condition+finding structure, but it focuses on COVID vs viral illness and does not address the asthma-related differential noted by the doctor. Thus it is only weakly aligned with the asked comparison."
