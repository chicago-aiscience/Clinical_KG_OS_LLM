  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Generated accurately lists redness, tenderness, and soreness at the site from [P-1], matching Gold. Location matches. However, it omits several Gold details like 'stuck pretty good,' no bullseye rash [P-6], and 'totally fine aside' [P-18]. For systemic, it correctly notes joint pain [D-7] and fever [D-8] screening but misrepresents denials using [P-1]/[P-3] instead of direct 'No' [P-7]/[P-8], and falsely claims no headaches screening despite [D-19]/[P-19-20] in transcript and Gold. This introduces contradictions on headaches and denial evidence, making significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: Local - precise location/crease, stuck good, sore skin/not joint, red/tender [P-1], red/tender [P-6], no bullseye [P-6], fine aside tenderness [P-18], healthy [P-13] (8 points). Systemic - joint pain [D-7/P-7], fever [D-8/P-8], headaches [D-19/P-19-20] (3 points). Generated covers location, red/tender/sore/not joint (4/8 local partial), joint/fever screening (2/3 systemic) but misses denials/rash/etc., wrong denial cites, no headaches. Covers ~40-45% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Local claims verifiable [P-1]. Systemic screening cites [D-7/D-8] accurate. However, denial via 'focusing localized [P-1]' and 'not too bad [P-3]' not direct denials ([P-7/P-8]); interpretive/misgrounded. Note 'no headaches screening' hallucinates absence despite explicit [D-19]. Multiple ungrounded/misrepresented claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around local symptoms at site and systemic symptoms (joint pain, fever) screened/denied, addressing question precisely; note on headaches relevant to query's inclusion."
