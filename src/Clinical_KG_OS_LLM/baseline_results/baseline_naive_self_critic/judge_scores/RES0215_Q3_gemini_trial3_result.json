{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as asthma, which aligns with the gold answer's conclusion of pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. The supporting evidence provided (triggers, cold weather, allergies) is factually accurate according to the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is less comprehensive than the gold answer. It misses several key supporting findings mentioned in the gold answer: the nocturnal wheezing episode (P-43/44), the importance of symptoms occurring across multiple settings (P-38), the spontaneous resolution with rest (P-6/33), and the pertinent negatives (lack of fever, phlegm, etc.) that rule out infection. It covers approximately 50-60% of the reasoning depth found in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. The citations (P-3, P-38, P-35, P-36, P-1, P-2) are accurate. The mention of a 'Knowledge Graph' is an internal processing reference and not a hallucination of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses the question, focusing on the diagnosis and the transcript-based evidence."
