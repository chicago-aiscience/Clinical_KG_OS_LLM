  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it states that specific prescription medications for COPD are not explicitly named, whereas the patient clearly states in the transcript [P-28] that they are taking a 'long acting beta agonist'. It correctly identifies the salt water gargle, painkillers, and vitamins.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the primary chronic medication (long-acting beta agonist) and omits the patient's denial of other substances (alcohol, cannabis, other drugs) which were included in the Gold Answer as relevant clinical context. It covers about 50-60% of the key points compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails faithfulness by claiming that information (COPD medication name) is missing from the text when it is explicitly provided. This is a negative hallucination (falsely claiming information is absent).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question, structuring the information appropriately into treatment categories."
