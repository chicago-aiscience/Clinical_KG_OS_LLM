  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The local symptoms listed (redness, tenderness, soreness behind the knee/crease) align with the transcript and Gold Answer. However, the Generated Answer makes a major factual error by stating the doctor did not screen for headaches; in the transcript the doctor explicitly asks “So no headaches?” [D-19] and the patient denies [P-19, P-20]. It also implies the patient denied fever/joint pain indirectly (“by focusing solely on localized symptoms”) rather than noting her direct denials (“No.” [P-7]; “No… I’ve been fine.” [P-8]).",
    "completeness": "It captures some key local findings (behind knee/crease, red, tender, sore) and systemic screening for joint pain and fever/illness with denials. It misses multiple Gold Answer elements: the tick being “stuck pretty good” [P-1], the explicit denial of a bullseye/target rash or larger circle rash [P-6], and the headache screening/denial [D-19, P-19, P-20]. Overall, it covers roughly half to two-thirds of the Gold Answer points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most local symptom claims are grounded in [P-1]. But the statement “transcript does not indicate that the doctor screened the patient for headaches” directly contradicts the transcript [D-19]. The added interpretation that she denied symptoms ‘by focusing solely on localized symptoms’ is not stated and is an unnecessary inference. These issues reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally focused on the requested local symptoms and systemic symptoms screened (fever, joint pain, headaches). However, it fails to report the headache screening/denial and instead adds an incorrect note about it, which detracts from directly answering the question."

  "summary": "Partially captures the local findings and fever/joint-pain screening, but it incorrectly claims headaches were not screened (contradicting the transcript) and omits several key details like lack of bullseye rash and the headache denial."
