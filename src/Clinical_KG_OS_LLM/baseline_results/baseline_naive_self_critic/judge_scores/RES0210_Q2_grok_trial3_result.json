  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor as the prescribed medication for cholesterol (consistent with Gold and [P-25, P-26]) and Tylenol as OTC with partial effectiveness ('helps a little bit' [P-14]). However, it inaccurately attributes Tylenol to relieving cough specifically (not stated in transcript or Gold, which links it to feverish/unwell symptoms) and relies on a non-existent 'knowledge graph' for conditions, introducing minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: Lipitor for cholesterol, Tylenol OTC with effectiveness reported. Misses explicit statement that Lipitor is the only prescribed medication [P-27], no other meds mentioned, and Gold's notes on non-medication relief [P-13], allergies [P-29]; covers ~80-90% of core medication details.",
    "faithfulness": "Lipitor mention and cholesterol verified in [P-25, P-26]; Tylenol mention and effectiveness in [P-14] verified. However, conditions sourced from fabricated 'knowledge graph' not in transcript; Tylenol-cough link plausible but not verifiable in transcript (no direct statement), constituting hallucination of specific relations and external knowledge.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists medications, conditions, and OTC effectiveness with sources, perfectly matching the question without off-topic content."
