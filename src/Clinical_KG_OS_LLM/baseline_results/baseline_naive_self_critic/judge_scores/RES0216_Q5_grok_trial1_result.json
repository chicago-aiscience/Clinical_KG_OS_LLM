  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient's asthma history [P-16], self-directed reduction in medication use inferred from [D-34] (aligning with skips and no refill detailed in Gold via [P-17-20]), link to symptoms of chest tightness and breathing difficulty [P-1, P-7], and doctor's assessment of possible asthma recurrence [D-35]. Core relation to exacerbation is accurate per Gold. Minor discrepancies include less precise details on exact dosing changes (morning only [P-19]) and rescue specifics, plus irrelevant 'Knowledge Graph' reference and citation error ([D-36] misquoted for P-7 symptom).",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: asthma history [P-16], medication limiting [D-34], symptoms (tightness/SOB [P-1]), doctor's asthma suspicion [D-35,D-36]. Misses: well-controlled for years [P-29], exact maintenance reduction to mornings [P-19,P-20], no rescue refill details [P-17,P-18], phlegm/hoarseness [P-11], 'feels different' [P-16], lack of rescue leading to treatment plan [D-35]. Approximately 60-70% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: asthma [P-16], limiting meds [D-34], symptoms [P-1,P-7], doctor's view [D-35,D-36]. Hallucinations: 'Knowledge Graph' (not in transcript), misattribution of 'harder to get a whole breath' to [D-36] (actually [P-7]). 'Chest tightness clinically indicated as SOB' plausible but not directly verifiable. Some unverifiable/plausible additions amid accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by explaining how asthma history plus self-reduced meds (skips/no refill) likely caused exacerbation manifesting as current symptoms, with step-by-step linkage and conclusion focused on relation; minor extraneous elements do not detract significantly."
