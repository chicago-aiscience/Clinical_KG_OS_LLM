  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer: current statin for cholesterol [P-15], historical antibiotics for prior tick bite with target rash [P-3], and proposed prophylactic antibiotics for Lyme disease [D-6]. No contradictions or errors; omissions do not affect factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: current statin therapy for cholesterol [P-14/P-15]; past antibiotics for tick bite rash [P-3]; new prophylactic antibiotics proposed [D-6/D-13/D-18]. Missed: explicit cholesterol management context reinforcement, no allergies [P-16/P-17], physician consultation [D-13/D-22], no specific antibiotic details, ~10 years prior, environmental insecticide [D-18]. Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-15, D-6, P-3]. Minor unverifiable addition of 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript), but core content grounded; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing discussed medications (current statin, past/proposed antibiotics) and treatments with structure matching query focus; no off-topic content."
