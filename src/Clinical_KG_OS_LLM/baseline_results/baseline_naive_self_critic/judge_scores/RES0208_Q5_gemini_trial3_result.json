  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain information about the grandson's visit, daycare, travel, or client visits. All of this information is explicitly present in the transcript: grandson/daycare in [P-23], travel in [P-24], and client visits in [P-31] and [P-32]. The Generated Answer fails to connect the grandson's cold to the infection assessment.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the timing of the grandson's visit relative to the symptoms, the exclusion of travel outside the province, and the exclusion of recent in-person client visits.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the information is missing from the provided text. It claims the segments provided do not contain the necessary details, which is factually untrue as the full transcript was provided.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the doctor's assessment of symptoms but fails to answer the primary specific questions regarding exposure pathways, dismissing them as unavailable."
