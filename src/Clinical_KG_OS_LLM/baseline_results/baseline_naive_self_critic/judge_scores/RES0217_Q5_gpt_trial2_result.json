  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The first part (timeline-based estimate) is consistent with the transcript and Gold Answer: patient outdoors Friday and Saturday [P-1], and the doctor explicitly infers >72 hours [D-6]. However, the Generated Answer is factually wrong in the second part: it claims there is no discussion of an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map and no use of Strathroy’s position to justify prophylaxis, but the transcript explicitly includes this in [D-13] (“Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario… Strathroy is close enough to be considered… concerning point… moving forward with antibiotics”). This is a significant contradiction of both transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core attachment-duration reasoning (Friday hiking + Saturday gardening → doctor infers >72 hours) and cites [D-6]. It omits/denies the entire geographic-risk justification using the Ontario Lyme map and Strathroy’s proximity to a concerning area [D-13], and it also omits supporting context noted in the Gold Answer (patient uncertainty about when acquired [P-1], removal earlier today [D-1], and doctor’s comment about time since last outdoors [D-2]). Overall, it captures only a minority of the Gold Answer’s required points, and it misses one full half of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not fully grounded in the transcript because it incorrectly states the transcript does not contain discussion of the Ontario Lyme distribution map; that discussion is directly present at [D-13]. Aside from that, the duration inference is grounded and accurately cited. The incorrect negation of explicit transcript content constitutes a major faithfulness issue.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address both parts of the question (attachment duration and geographic/map-based justification) and stays on-topic. However, the second part provides an on-topic but incorrect denial rather than the requested explanation."

  "summary": "Accurately explains the >72-hour estimate from the Friday/Saturday outdoor exposure, but incorrectly denies the transcript’s explicit Lyme map/Strathroy geographic-risk rationale, making the overall answer incomplete and substantially inaccurate."
