  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about living situation [D-45,P-45], environmental exposures [D-46,P-46], sick contacts [D-47,P-47], workplace [D-48,P-48,D-50,P-50], and travel [D-49,P-49]. The Generated Answer claims 'the doctor did not systematically explore' these areas, which directly contradicts the evidence in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: living situation details (apartment alone), environmental exposures inquiry (carpets, dust, mold, pets), sick contacts (possible exposure at work lunchroom), workplace details (car dealership), travel history inquiry (denied), and substance use screening. Coverage is approximately 0% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations and misrepresentations. It claims the doctor did not ask about these exposure sources when the transcript explicitly shows these questions were asked [D-45-D-50]. The answer also incorrectly states that contact tracing was only mentioned as a future procedure, ignoring the actual direct questions about sick contacts [D-47] and workplace illness [D-50].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question but provides an incorrect answer. It directly claims the doctor did not explore exposure sources, which is the opposite of what the question asks about and what actually occurred in the transcript."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect and contradicts the source transcript. It claims the doctor did not systematically explore exposure sources when the transcript clearly documents the doctor asking about living situation [D-45], environmental exposures [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48,D-50], and travel [D-49]. The answer provides 0% coverage of the Gold Answer's key points and contains significant hallucinations by misrepresenting what occurred in the consultation. While it addresses the general topic, it provides completely inaccurate information."
