  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states there were no negative findings and that the doctor did not screen for symptoms like fever, dyspnea, or sore throat, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence (e.g., D-10 fever denied, D-11 difficulty breathing denied, D-13 sore throat denied); it fabricates that these were not discussed, while Gold Answer accurately lists them with citations.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer lists key negative findings (no fever, no dyspnea, no headaches, no sore throat, no chills/night sweats, no muscle aches/weakness, no chest pain, no sputum/blood, no cough triggers) with citations, explains clinical implications (patient not acutely unwell, generally well per D-16), and notes absence of chronic conditions etc.; Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying negatives exist and listing positives.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that symptoms like fever [D-10], dyspnea [D-11], sore throat [D-13] were not screened or discussed, despite explicit doctor questions and patient denials in transcript; claims 'absence not evaluated' is entirely fabricated; only positives are accurately noted but irrelevant to query.",
    "relevance": "Question specifically asks for negative findings screened and confirmed absent, with list and explanation of clinical impact; Generated Answer denies any negatives were screened, pivots to positives and COVID suspicion, failing to address the core request for negatives and their role in clinical picture."
