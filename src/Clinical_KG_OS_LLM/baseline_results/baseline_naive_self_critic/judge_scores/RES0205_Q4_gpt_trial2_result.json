  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and a COVID test as the test used.\n- Incorrect on timing: the transcript *does* explicitly state timing—\"I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago\" [P-36]. The generated answer’s claim that timing is not explicitly detailed contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer.\n- Adds an unsupported implication about needing “exclusionary documentation.”",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered:\n- COVID-19 ruled out via COVID test (covered).\n- Patient works at a hospital and coworkers are scared when they cough (covered).\n\nKey Gold Answer elements missed:\n- The test was done at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior (missed/denied).\n- Hospital/PPE context showing infection-control awareness (missed).\n- Patient stayed home after testing and is eager to return but doesn’t want to be coughing (missed).\n- Link between wanting medication and workplace pressure/return-to-work concern (missed).",
    "faithfulness": "- Mostly grounded for COVID test, workplace, and coworkers being scared (all in transcript).\n- Contains hallucinated/unsupported content: “identified in the Knowledge Graph” (no such source in transcript) and “need for exclusionary documentation” (not stated).\n- The statement about timing being non-explicit is not faithful to [P-36].",
    "relevance": "- Directly addresses all parts of the question (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns).\n- Minimal extraneous content, though “Knowledge Graph” and “documentation” are unnecessary and not asked for."
