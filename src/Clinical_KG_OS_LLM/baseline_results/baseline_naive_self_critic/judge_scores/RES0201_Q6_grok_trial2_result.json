{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer's facts: assessment links symptoms to COVID-19 (direct quote paraphrase consistent), includes COPD history, lists exact tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray) with citations, and precisely quotes isolation instructions including conditions for continuation (symptoms persist even if negative). No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: assessment (symptoms in line with COVID-19), COPD mention, COVID swab, chest X-ray, isolation until results, continued isolation if symptomatic post-negative test. Misses minor Gold details like X-ray rationale tied to breathing/COPD, 'heads up' framing, physician consultation, and patient acknowledgment, but covers 100% of core question elements (assessment, tests, isolation instructions/conditions).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: symptoms/COVID link [D-43], COPD [P-27], tests [D-43], isolation details [D-43]. 'Condition inside the chest' paraphrases 'what's going on in there' accurately. No hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly focused on question: structures response into assessment, diagnostic tests, and isolation instructions/conditions with no off-topic content or tangents."
