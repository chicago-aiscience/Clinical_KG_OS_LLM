  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the COVID swab as the test ordered, and accurately describes the social contact detail about walking with a sick friend while sometimes being too close. All facts align with the Gold Answer and source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main components requested: the condition (COVID), the test (COVID swab), and the social contact detail (walking with sick friend, being too close outdoors). However, it omits several details present in the Gold Answer: the patient's uncertainty about whether the friend got tested, the doctor's screening for COVID-associated symptoms (smell, taste, confusion, muscle aches), and the travel history question. These additional details provide fuller clinical context.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [D-43], [P-20]. No hallucinated information is present. The answer stays grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what condition, what test, and what social contact detail. It maintains focus throughout without tangential information. The summary section effectively reinforces the key points."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key facts (COVID as condition to rule out, COVID swab as test, sick friend contact as prompt) with proper citations and no factual errors. However, it provides a more abbreviated response compared to the Gold Answer, omitting contextual details such as COVID symptom screening questions, the patient's uncertainty about friend's testing, and travel history. Despite this reduced completeness, the answer remains fully correct, faithful to the transcript, and directly relevant to the question asked."
