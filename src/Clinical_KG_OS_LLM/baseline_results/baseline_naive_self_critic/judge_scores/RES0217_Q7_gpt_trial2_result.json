  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer: hiking Friday and gardening Saturday; uncertainty about when attachment occurred; tick discovered and removed the same day due to soreness/redness/tenderness behind the left knee; brought in a plastic container; clinician estimated possible >72 hours attachment; prior episode ~10 years ago involved bullseye/target rash and antibiotics; prior tick more swollen/engorged than current; current episode lacks bullseye rash and has only local redness/tenderness. No clear contradictions or factual errors relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key Gold Answer elements: Friday hiking + Saturday gardening, uncertainty of exposure source, discovery prompted by soreness, removal and bringing tick in container, clinician’s >72h estimate, comparison to prior bullseye rash/antibiotics and greater engorgement then vs minimal now, and no bullseye currently.\nMinor omissions vs Gold Answer: does not mention the hiking location (Strathroy) and does not explicitly include the doctor’s “little grape” engorgement comparison or the patient’s explicit statement that the tick was “pretty small” (though it conveys minimal swelling).",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are supported by the transcript segments cited (e.g., Friday/Saturday exposures [P-1], uncertainty [P-1], local symptoms [P-1, P-6], prior bullseye rash and antibiotics and engorgement comparison [P-3], and clinician’s >72h statement and prophylaxis discussion [D-6]). No notable hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by describing the exposure-to-presentation timeline and contrasting current local symptoms/engorgement with the prior tick bite episode. No meaningful irrelevant tangents."
