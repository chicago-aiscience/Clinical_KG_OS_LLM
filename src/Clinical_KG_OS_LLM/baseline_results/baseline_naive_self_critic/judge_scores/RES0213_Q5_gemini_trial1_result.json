{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the father's heart attack, the patient's smoking history, and the stress related to her Master's program and anxiety as key factors.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main themes but misses several specific details present in the gold answer, such as the grandfather's accidental death, the specific duration of heavier smoking (10 cigarettes/day for 2 years), her living situation (living alone), her nervousness about running, and the physical symptom of breathing faster during episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript but hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information. While the logical connections attributed to the graph (e.g., stress triggering chest pain) are supported by the transcript's context, the source itself is not provided in the prompt.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing all parts of the multi-part question regarding family history, smoking, and stressors."
