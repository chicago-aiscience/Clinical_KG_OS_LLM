  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s main diagnosis of asthma (with an exercise-induced component) matches the Gold Answer’s conclusion of pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in an atopic context. The cited supporting findings (exertional dyspnea [P-3], cold worsening [P-38], seasonal allergies/Reactine [P-35–P-36], wheeze/cough/difficulty deep breaths [P-1–P-2]) are all consistent with asthma. Minor issue: it does not explicitly identify the pattern as episodic/reversible with rest (a key asthma feature) and does not mention the multi-setting nature of symptoms, but it does not state anything contradictory.",
    "completeness": "Covered key Gold Answer supports: (1) exercise-triggered symptoms ([P-3]) and (5) atopic history/seasonal allergies with antihistamine use ([P-35–P-36]), (3) cold weather worsening ([P-38]), and general wheeze/SOB description ([P-1–P-2]). Missed key Gold Answer supports: (2) episodic/reversible pattern resolving with rest ([P-6], [P-33]); (4) occurring across multiple settings ([P-38], plus home context [P-40–P-41]); (6) nocturnal wheezy episode ([P-43–P-44]); (7) pertinent negatives arguing against infection (no fever [P-7], no runny nose [P-8], no sick contacts [P-10], no phlegm [P-31]). Overall, it captures roughly about half of the Gold Answer’s supporting points.",
    "faithfulness": "The specific transcript citations used are accurate and support the statements made. The only mildly ungrounded phrasing is the generic reference to “environmental stress” and “allergic asthma” as labels; while plausible interpretations, they are not explicitly stated in the transcript. No major hallucinated facts or incorrect citations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by naming the most likely diagnosis and listing transcript findings that support it. No meaningful tangents."
