  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several major factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It states the cough has been occurring for 'maybe a month,' whereas the patient explicitly states in [P-2] and [P-13] that she has had it for three months. Most significantly, it claims there is no information regarding subjective fevers, whereas [P-4] clearly records the patient saying she felt 'hot at night in the past couple days.' It also fails to mention the 'three days' timeframe for the greenish sputum.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the initial 3-month onset, the distinction between the dry/intermittent phase and the intensified phase, the specific 3-day duration of the productive cough, and the occurrence of subjective fevers in the last couple of days.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails the faithfulness check by claiming that information about fevers is not in the transcript, which is a hallucination of absence. It also misinterprets [P-19] (which refers to the sleep disruption duration) as the total duration of the cough, ignoring the earlier mention of three months in [P-2].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to address the specific categories requested in the prompt (onset, sleep, sputum, fevers), though the content provided within those categories is largely inaccurate."
