  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (loss of taste, smell, and mild dry cough) matching the Gold Answer, correctly cites the doctor's explicit connection in D-39, and specifies the swab test method from D-39. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer; all stated facts are fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: combination of symptoms (loss of smell/taste, dry cough), doctor's connection via D-39 quote, specific test (swab). Missed points: patient's initial COVID worry in P-1 explicitly, confirmation of absent symptoms (fever P-10, etc.), 'pretty well' summary D-16/P-16, narrow profile rationale, and self-isolation emphasis D-39. Covers core ~80% of Gold Answer's key elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: symptoms from P-1, doctor's statement and test from D-39. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing the symptom combination, explaining the doctor's connection to COVID-19 suspicion, and detailing the test method with citations; structured response with no off-topic content."
