  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: husband's week-long similar illness suggesting household transmission (matches Gold's emphasis and D-53 quote), limited outside contact (partially via hiking and no provincial travel, aligning with Gold's limited exposure but less detail on work-from-home and self-isolation), and lack of flu shot increasing influenza possibility (matches Gold). It correctly notes prioritization of COVID-19 testing. Minor discrepancies include rephrasing limited contact as 'exclusion of imported disease' (plausible but not Gold's phrasing) and adding symptom correlation (not central to Gold's epi focus). Wrong citation for flu shot (P-27 vs. actual P-53) is a minor error as the fact is correct. Overall, core facts consistent with minor issues.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: 1) Husband's symptoms past week [P-19,P-20] and doctor's acknowledgment [D-51,D-53] (fully covered); 2) Limited outside contact including work from home [P-23,P-42], self-isolating [P-22], hiking [P-18], no other sick contacts [P-17] (partially: hiking and no travel covered, but misses explicit work-from-home, self-isolating, and denied sick contacts beyond husband); 3) No flu shot [P-53] and doctor's note [D-53,D-54] (fully covered); 4) Collective shaping prioritizing COVID rule-out over flu (fully covered). Covers ~85-90% with some detail gaps on limited contact.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded: husband's symptoms [P-19], doctor's COVID priority [D-53], hiking/local exposure [P-18], symptoms [P-1], flu/influenza possibility [D-54]. Errors: Flu shot cited as [P-27] (incorrect; P-27 is 'No' to neck swelling, actual [P-53]); 'clinical knowledge graph [KG]' fabricated/not in transcript; 'rules out imported cases' plausible but interpretive/not direct quote. Multiple citation errors and hallucination reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how specified epi factors (husband's illness, shared household/limited contact, no flu shot) shape COVID vs. influenza differential, with doctor's prioritization. Minor tangents: extra symptom analysis and [KG] reference, but stays focused on question without off-topic content."
