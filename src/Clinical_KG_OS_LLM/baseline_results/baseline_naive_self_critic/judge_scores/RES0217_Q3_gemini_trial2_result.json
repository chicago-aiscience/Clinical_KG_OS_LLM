  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the key findings in the transcript regarding the 72-hour duration, the prior history of a tick bite 10 years ago with a bullseye rash, and the exposure activities (hiking/gardening).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several specific points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific geographic location 'Strathroy' and the use of the 'Ontario Lyme disease distribution map'. 2) The patient's specific mention that 'lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers'. 3) The mention of sending the tick for species identification to the lab. The 'Geographic Risk Assessment' section in the generated answer describes tick habitats (long grass) rather than the clinical geographic risk (endemicity/location map) discussed in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are well-grounded in the transcript. The citations [P-1], [D-6], [D-18], and [P-3] are accurate to the content described.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question and uses the categories requested in the prompt to structure the response."
