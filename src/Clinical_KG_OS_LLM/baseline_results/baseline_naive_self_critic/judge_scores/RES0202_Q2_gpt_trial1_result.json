  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript and Gold Answer on the items it includes: COVID swab testing [D-44], isolation for 14 days [D-44], and isolating from the younger sister [D-44]. It does not introduce incorrect facts (e.g., it does not claim medications were prescribed).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) COVID swab test, (2) 14-day isolation, (3) isolate from younger sister. \nKey elements missed from the Gold Answer: expected test turnaround (24–48 hours), false-negative possibility, possibility of other viral illness if negative, explicit ER/return precautions (high fever, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, fainting), supportive/observational approach (no meds; wait for results), and the school requirement for a COVID test to return. Overall coverage is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are directly supported by the transcript (primarily [D-44]). No hallucinated household members, durations, or treatments are added.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on exactly what was asked (management measures, test, isolation and duration, and who to isolate from), but it is incomplete regarding the full set of management measures (especially precautions and test timing)."
