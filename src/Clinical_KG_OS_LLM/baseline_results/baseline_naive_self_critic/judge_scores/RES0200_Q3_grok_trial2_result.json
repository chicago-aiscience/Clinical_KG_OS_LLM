  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (worsening cough [P-1], sputum changes to yellow [P-6], increased dyspnea [P-1, P-8]) matching the Gold Answer's description, correctly cites the doctor's synthesis in [D-52] linking worsening symptoms to baseline COPD history, with no factual errors or contradictions despite minor differences in citation specifics (e.g., Gold uses P-5 for cough worsening, but P-1 covers it equivalently).",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points: three cardinal symptoms with details on worsening cough, sputum change, intensified dyspnea/SOB; COPD history as context; doctor's explicit linking in [D-52] via worsening vs. baseline. Misses minor details like exact COPD duration (5 years [P-2]), specific inhalers (Ventolin/Spiriva [P-11]), and cough triggered by stairs [P-5], covering ~90-95% of Gold's specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: symptom descriptions and timelines match patient statements [P-1, P-5-6, P-8]; doctor's quote from [D-52] is verbatim and accurately contextualized; no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly and comprehensively addresses the question by specifying the exact symptom combination (worsening cough, sputum changes, increased dyspnea) with COPD history and detailing the doctor's linkage via [D-52], with no off-topic content."
