  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the Gold Answer regarding the core link between the missed Keppra dose and the seizure. It accurately cites the patient's own admission in P-9.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key supporting details provided in the Gold Answer, such as the specific reason for the missed dose (daughter's birthday/disrupted dinner routine), the fact that the disclosure was voluntary/unprompted by direct questioning about adherence, and the patient's comment about the rarity of their seizures which reinforces the causal link.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript, although it incorrectly references a 'knowledge graph and clinical notes' which were not provided in the source material. However, the clinical content extracted is faithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses both parts of the question regarding the connection and the evidence of the patient's recognition."
