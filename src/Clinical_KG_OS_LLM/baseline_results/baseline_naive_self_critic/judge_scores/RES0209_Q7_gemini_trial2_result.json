  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a factual error: it claims the patient identified goldfish as a trigger, whereas the transcript only mentions them as pets [P-39]. It also omits the specific quantitative frequencies mentioned in the gold answer (once every two weeks vs. five to six times a week), which are central to describing the 'evolution' requested.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points found in the Gold Answer: the specific baseline usage frequency (once every two weeks), the specific current frequency (5-6 times per week), the symptom of chest tightness, the observation that wheezing occurs more frequently than medication use, and the exclusion of infectious causes.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim regarding goldfish as a trigger is a hallucination; the transcript shows the doctor asking about pets and the patient responding with 'goldfish' without any link to asthma triggers. The rest of the answer is well-grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is very relevant, directly addressing the evolution of symptoms and usage using a structured timeline that matches the query's requirements."
