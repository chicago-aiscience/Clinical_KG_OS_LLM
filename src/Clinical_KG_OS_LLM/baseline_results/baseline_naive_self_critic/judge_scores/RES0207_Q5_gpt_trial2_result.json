  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main risk factors in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (patient forgot their seizure medication) and (2) hereditary predisposition (epilepsy runs in family; mother affected). It accurately links family history to genetic predisposition for the patient’s underlying epilepsy diagnosis and cites the relevant transcript locations (P-9, P-26, P-8). No substantive contradictions with the Gold Answer are present. Minor issue: it does not explicitly name Keppra as the missed medication, but it does correctly describe missed antiseizure medication as the trigger.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: hereditary risk via maternal epilepsy (P-26); medication non-adherence as precipitant (P-9); patient’s underlying epilepsy diagnosis (P-8). Key points missed from Gold Answer: the specific medication name Keppra (P-23); the contextual reason for missing the dose (daughter’s birthday / disrupted dinner routine, P-24); and the note that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent (P-9). Overall it captures the core factors but omits several supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (missed meds; maternal epilepsy; patient has epilepsy). However, repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and an explicit graph relation are not part of the transcript and are therefore not verifiable from the provided source, though they don’t introduce conflicting clinical facts. This constitutes minor ungrounded content but not major hallucination of clinical events.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on hereditary and medication-related seizure risk factors and explicitly addresses how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. No meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "Accurately identifies the key hereditary (maternal epilepsy) and medication non-adherence risks and relates family history to diagnosis, but omits some supporting details (Keppra, missed-dose context, seizure frequency) and includes minor ungrounded “knowledge graph” content."
