  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the 20-year smoking history (quoting '1/2 pack a day' from [P-40]) as the primary risk factor for COPD, aligning with Gold. It accurately describes the chain starting with sick contact exposure [P-20], symptoms like green sputum [P-1], fever [P-9], and doctor's confirmation [D-43]. However, minor discrepancies include not mentioning quit timing (4-5 years ago [P-7,P-40]) or persistent COPD requiring inhalers [P-26], and introducing COVID-19 specificity and 'knowledge graph' links not in Gold or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: smoking history details [P-40], exposure and closeness [P-20], green-yellow sputum [P-1], fever [P-9], doctor corroboration [D-43], worsening symptoms. Missed: quit at diagnosis 4-5 years ago [P-7], daily/rescue inhalers for persistent COPD [P-26], sinus pressure [P-12], headache [P-14], patient's suggestion of getting sick [P-23], past pattern of COPD worsening when sick [P-3], 3-day timeline [P-1]. Covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims from transcript are verifiable: smoking [P-40], exposure [P-20], symptoms [P-1,P-9], doctor [D-43]. However, multiple 'knowledge graph' references (e.g., smoking--RISK_FACTOR-->COPD, sick friend-->COVID, symptoms-->exacerbation) are not in transcript, representing hallucinated external structures. COVID emphasis is plausible but not directly grounded, as transcript notes ruling out COVID generically.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured with sections directly addressing smoking-COPD relation and the full chain of events from exposure to exacerbation, with no irrelevant content or tangents."
