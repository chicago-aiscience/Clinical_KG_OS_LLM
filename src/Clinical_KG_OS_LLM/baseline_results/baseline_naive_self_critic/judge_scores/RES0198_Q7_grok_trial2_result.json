  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately captures onset one week ago [P-1,P-2], stuffy nose first [P-3], shift to mostly runny [P-3], decongestant influence [P-10], initial 'on and off' [P-1] clarified to 'pretty constant' [P-8], and no improvement [P-1]. Generated Answer correctly identifies one-week onset [P-1], stuffy first transitioning to runny [P-3], but inaccurately states both symptoms began together without prioritizing stuffy as first, definitively labels symptoms as intermittent based only on [P-1] ignoring [P-8] constant clarification, and omits decongestant role and lack of improvement. Some factual errors on symptom onset simultaneity, pattern of symptoms, and misses influences, but core progression (stuffy to runny) aligns.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1-week onset, initial stuffy, shift to runny, decongestant influence, pattern nuance (on/off to constant), no improvement. Generated covers: 1-week onset (yes), first stuffy (yes), change to runny (yes), intermittent pattern partially (only on/off). Misses: decongestant [P-10], constant clarification [P-8], no improvement explicit. Covers ~60% of key points (main progression but incomplete on pattern and influences).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated verifiable: both symptoms past week and 'on and off' [P-1], stuffy first now mostly running [P-3]. No hallucinations or inaccurate citations; selective omission of [P-8] and [P-10] but present claims grounded directly in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response around onset/initial symptoms, progression of predominant symptom, and summary addressing first symptom, change over week, and frequency—perfectly matches question without off-topic content."
