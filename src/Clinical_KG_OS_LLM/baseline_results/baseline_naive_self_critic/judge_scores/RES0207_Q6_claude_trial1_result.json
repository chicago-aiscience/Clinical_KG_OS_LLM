  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims the transcript ends at [P-26], but the provided transcript clearly continues through [D-38], which explicitly contains the doctor's communication about next steps. The Generated Answer contradicts the Gold Answer and the actual transcript content by stating information is not available when it clearly is.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) the doctor consulting with another physician, (2) the collaborative decision-making process, (3) returning to discuss next steps, (4) potential tests, (5) developing a management plan, or (6) any other relevant details from segments D-37 and D-38.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a factually incorrect claim that the transcript ends at [P-26], which is not grounded in the provided source material. The transcript clearly continues through [D-38]. This represents a fundamental misreading or hallucination about the transcript's content and structure.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question. It claims the information is unavailable rather than providing the requested details about next steps, decision-makers, and follow-up actions that are clearly present in the transcript segments D-37 and D-38."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is wholly inadequate and receives the minimum score across all dimensions. It incorrectly claims the transcript ends at [P-26] when it actually continues through [D-38], which contains all the information needed to answer the question. This fundamental error results in: complete factual incorrectness, zero coverage of key points, a hallucinated claim about transcript content, and failure to address the question. The answer contradicts both the Gold Answer and the clearly available source material."
