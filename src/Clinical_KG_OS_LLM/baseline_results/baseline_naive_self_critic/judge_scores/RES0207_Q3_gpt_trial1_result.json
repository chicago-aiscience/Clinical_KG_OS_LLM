  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly links the seizure to a missed anti-epileptic dose and supports this with the patient’s statement in P-9 (“I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have yeah”) and correctly identifies the medication as Keppra (P-23). However, it slightly overstates causality (“causes a seizure”) whereas the patient expressed it as a tentative attribution (“I think that might have…”). It also claims the patient “clarified that the frequency of their seizures is linked to adherence,” which is not explicitly stated in the transcript (the patient only says they don’t get seizures very often and they forgot their med).",
    "completeness": "Covers the core elements: (1) seizure occurred and (2) patient connected it to forgetting their medication, with the key supporting quote (P-9) and medication name (Keppra, P-23). Misses several Gold Answer details: the disrupted routine/daughter’s birthday explanation for the missed dose (P-24), the point that the attribution was volunteered in response to a different question rather than prompted about adherence (D-9/P-9), the “usually don’t get seizures very often” framing as evidence the episode was unusual (P-9), and the note that no clinician-confirmed causality is provided.",
    "faithfulness": "Partially grounded: the cited seizure report (P-8), missed med attribution (P-9), and Keppra identification (P-23) are verifiable. But the mention of a “knowledge graph and clinical notes” is not in the transcript, and the statement that the patient linked seizure frequency to adherence is not directly supported. These are plausible but not transcript-grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by explaining the missed-dose–seizure connection and citing the patient’s own words as evidence of their recognition of the link. No major tangents beyond the brief (unnecessary) mention of a knowledge graph."
