  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies all key facts from the Gold Answer: COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, the swab test, the 24-48 hour turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. All statements are factually consistent with the Gold Answer and the source transcript. No errors or contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all the main points from the Gold Answer regarding the condition, test type, turnaround time, and alternative diagnosis. However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the 14-day isolation instruction, public health contact tracing for positive results, and the note about supportive management being the same regardless of diagnosis. These are secondary details but do represent approximately 20-25% of the Gold Answer's content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations to [D-52]. The answer provides exact quotes where appropriate and does not include any fabricated or hallucinated information. The content is entirely grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all four components of the question in a structured format: the condition to rule out, the diagnostic test, turnaround time, and alternative diagnosis. The organization using numbered points enhances clarity. No irrelevant information is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-structured response that correctly identifies all essential clinical information requested in the question. It demonstrates perfect correctness, faithfulness, and relevance with accurate citations. The only minor limitation is the omission of some contextual details from the Gold Answer (isolation instructions, contact tracing, supportive management approach), which prevents a perfect completeness score. Overall, this is a high-quality answer that effectively addresses the clinical question."
