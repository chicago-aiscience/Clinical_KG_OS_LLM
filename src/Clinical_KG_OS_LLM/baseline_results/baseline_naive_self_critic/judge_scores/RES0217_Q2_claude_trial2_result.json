  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key medications and treatments discussed: current statin therapy for cholesterol, proposed prophylactic antibiotics for the tick bite, and historical antibiotic treatment for a previous tick bite. All facts align with the Gold Answer and source transcript. The specific citations match the transcript references.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main medication points (current statin, proposed antibiotics, past antibiotics) but omits several details present in the Gold Answer: (1) no allergies/drug allergies mentioned, (2) no specific antibiotic details (name, dose, duration), (3) doctor's plan to consult supervising physician, (4) environmental prevention suggestion about insecticide use, and (5) some of the detailed explanations about the 72-hour timeline and reasoning. Covers approximately 60% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The citations [P-15], [D-6], and [P-3] are accurate and correspond to the correct statements. No hallucinated content is present. The answer stays grounded in what was explicitly discussed.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about medications and treatments discussed during the consultation. It covers the three main medication-related topics: current therapy, proposed treatment, and historical treatment. No irrelevant content is included, though it could be more comprehensive."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and well-grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. It directly addresses the core question about medications and treatments, covering current statin therapy, proposed prophylactic antibiotics, and past antibiotic treatment. However, it lacks completeness compared to the Gold Answer, omitting important details such as allergy information, environmental prevention advice, plans for physician consultation, and explanatory context about the treatment rationale. Despite missing these supplementary details, the answer captures all essential medication-related information without any errors or hallucinations."
