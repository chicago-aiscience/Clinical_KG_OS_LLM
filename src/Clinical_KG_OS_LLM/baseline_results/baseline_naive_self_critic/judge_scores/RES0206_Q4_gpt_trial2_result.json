{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all requested elements: (1) the condition to rule out is COVID-19, (2) the test ordered is a COVID swab, and (3) the prompting social-contact detail is that the patient had been walking dogs with friends and one friend was sick, with the patient noting they sometimes walked too close despite being outdoors. No contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "For the specific question asked (condition to rule out, test ordered, and the social-contact detail prompting consideration), the Generated Answer includes all key points. The Gold Answer additionally mentions other COVID screening questions (smell/taste, travel, myalgias, confusion), but those are not required by the user’s question, so no meaningful omissions for this prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "Core statements are directly supported by the transcript (D-43 for ruling out COVID and ordering a swab; P-20 for the sick friend and close walking). The phrase about a “knowledge graph” is not grounded in the transcript, but it does not add a new clinical fact; it is a minor extraneous/unverifiable reference.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what was asked: diagnosis to rule out, test, and the relevant social-contact exposure detail, with no substantive tangents."
