{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that the patient 'did not identify a specific potential exposure event,' whereas the transcript (P-18) and the Gold Answer clearly identify a hiking trip two weeks prior where people 'brushed by' the patient as the suspected exposure event.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to mention the hiking trip or the interaction with people on the trail, which are the primary points required by the question. It also fails to connect the exposure history to the diagnosis, focusing solely on symptoms because it erroneously concluded no exposure was mentioned.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the source transcript. In segment [P-18], the patient identifies the hiking trip as the only possible source of the illness. The Generated Answer's claim that no such event was described is a hallucination of absence.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to address both parts of the question, but because it misses the core evidence in the transcript, the content of the response is invalid."
