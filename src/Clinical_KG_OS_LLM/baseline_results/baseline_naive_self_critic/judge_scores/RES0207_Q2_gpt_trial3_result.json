  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the chronic medication as Keppra, consistent with the Gold Answer. For the missed-dose circumstance, it states only that the patient \"kind of forgot\"—this is true per the transcript (P-9) but does not capture the specific precipitating circumstance (daughter’s birthday/changed dinner routine) emphasized in the Gold Answer. It is not factually wrong, but it is imprecise relative to what was asked.",
    "completeness": "Included: (1) Keppra as the prescribed medication. Partially included: patient forgot to take the medication. Missing: the specific circumstance causing the missed dose—daughter’s birthday celebration, doing things earlier/differently, and not having dinner at the usual time (P-24). Also missing the context that this was situational rather than ongoing adherence difficulty (D-24/P-24), though that is secondary to the question. Overall, it covers about half of the key information required.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements made are directly supported by the transcript (Keppra: P-23; forgot: P-9). No hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the two asked elements (medication and why a dose was missed). However, it does not provide the requested *specific circumstance* behind the missed dose, limiting how well it addresses the second part."

  "summary": "Accurate and fully transcript-grounded, but incomplete because it omits the specific birthday/changed routine circumstance that led to the missed dose."
