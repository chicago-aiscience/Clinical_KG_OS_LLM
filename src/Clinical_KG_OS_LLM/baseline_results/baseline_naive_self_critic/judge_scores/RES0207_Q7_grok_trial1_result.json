  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the seizure occurring the previous night [P-8], attributed to forgetting Keppra [P-9], sudden shortness of breath upon waking [P-1], dry cough [P-4], and decision to seek care due to uncertainty [P-1], all consistent with the Gold Answer. Minor discrepancies include not specifying the seizure as 'later that night' after the birthday celebration and missing details like feeling 'fine after and went to bed' [P-8], but no factual errors or contradictions in stated facts. Score: 4",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: seizure last night [P-8], forgot Keppra [P-9], sudden SOB on waking [P-1], dry cough [P-2,P-4], decision to seek care [P-1]. Missed: daughter's birthday celebration disrupting routine [P-24], 'fine after and went to bed' [P-8], symptoms ~3 hours before consultation [P-11], temperature check 37.4°C [P-5,P-6], never had SOB before [P-3], uncertainty if related [P-8]. Covers approximately 50-60% of key points, significant omissions including required temperature check. Score: 3",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like seizure [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], missed med [P-9], Keppra [P-23], SOB [P-1], cough [P-4], seek care [P-1] are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. Family history [P-26] verifiable. Unverifiable: 'knowledge graph provided' and [PRECIPITATING_FACTOR] not in transcript, minor hallucinated reference but plausible inference from content. No multiple fabrications. Score: 4",
    "relevance": "Answer structures a timeline directly addressing the question's required elements (seizure, respiratory onset, seek care decision) from evening before to morning. Minor tangents: 'During Consultation' family history [P-26] slightly beyond timeline scope, knowledge graph mention. Mostly focused. Score: 4"
