  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the day-by-day progression: cough starting Wednesday evening (P-1), worsening slightly on Thursday with tiredness (P-1), further worsening on Friday with new fever over 100°F (P-1). Minor discrepancies include not specifying fever as 100.1-101°F (from P-2), attributing fatigue only to Thursday (P-1) while Gold distinguishes Thursday tiredness and Friday significant fatigue (P-25), and omitting runny nose (P-16) and mother's summary/correction (P-12, P-4). Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers: Wed cough onset; Thu cough worse + tired; Fri cough worse + fever + dec appetite/taste suspicion. Misses: exact fever range (P-2), runny nose (P-16), significant fatigue explicitly on Fri (P-25), mother's stepwise summary (P-12), 3-day correction (P-4). Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Wed/Thu/Fri cough progression and tired from P-1; fever from P-1; appetite/taste from P-17. Citations accurate to transcript. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by detailing day-by-day evolution from Wed eve to Fri, cough onset/severity changes, fever emergence on Fri, and other symptoms like fatigue (Thu) and dec appetite (Fri). No off-topic content."
