  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer, including the medication non-adherence (forgot med [P-9]) and hereditary risk (epilepsy runs in family, mom had it [P-26]), as well as the link to the patient's epilepsy diagnosis [P-8]. However, it omits specific details like the medication name (Keppra [P-23]), the reason for forgetting (daughter's birthday [P-24]), infrequent seizures normally [P-9], and well-controlled status. It also introduces a 'knowledge graph' not present in the Gold Answer, which is a minor discrepancy, but core facts remain consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: medication non-adherence [P-9], hereditary family history (mom [P-26]), relation to diagnosis via genetic predisposition and [P-8]. Missed from Gold: specific med Keppra [P-23], forgetting due to daughter's birthday celebration disrupting routine [P-24], patient acknowledgment of precipitation [P-9 details], infrequent seizures and good control with regular meds [P-9], clinician's family history question [D-26], explicit combination of factors. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims from transcript are verifiable: forgot med [P-9], family history and mom [P-26], patient has epilepsy [P-8]. However, multiple references to a 'knowledge graph' (e.g., identifies missed med as precipitant, links family history to diagnosis, [MEDICAL_HISTORY] ontology) are not present in the transcript, representing hallucinated content. Citations to transcript are accurate where used.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question by listing hereditary and medication risk factors with citations and explaining the family history's relation to the epilepsy diagnosis, with no off-topic content despite the extraneous knowledge graph mentions."
