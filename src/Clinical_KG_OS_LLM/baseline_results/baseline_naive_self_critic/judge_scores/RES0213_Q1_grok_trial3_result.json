  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately summarizes quality (uncomfortable/odd to sharp strong on deep breath), total duration (1.5 weeks), episode duration (20 min intermittent), situations (occurs alone walking/studying, resolves/noted when social/at school/activities, at rest, not worse exercise, no injury, first time). Generated Answer correctly notes quality (sharp/strong), deep breath trigger, 20 min duration, but major error claiming pain 'only during anxiety attacks' citing P-20 (which refers to heart fluttering/palpitations, not pain), missing total duration, nuanced quality, correct situations (alone vs social), rest/exercise details. Significant contradictions on key situations.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1.5 weeks total, quality nuance, sharp on deep breath, 20 min intermittent episodes, occurs walking/studying alone, resolves when social/hands-on, at rest, not worse exercise, no injury, first time. Generated covers quality (partial), deep breath, 20 min duration; misses total duration, full quality, all situation details (wrongly attributes to anxiety attacks), rest/exercise/no injury/first time. Covers ~20-30% accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "Quality (P-3), deep breath (P-3), duration (P-6/P-7), OTC (P-6), stress/family (P-8/P-13) grounded. Major hallucination: 'only during anxiety attacks' mis-cites P-20 (about palpitations fluttering, not pain); situations not matching transcript (P-4/P-9/P-11/P-29 describe alone/walking/studying vs social). Multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer around quality, duration, situations as asked, adds relevant trigger/context/treatment; minor extras but focused on question despite errors."
