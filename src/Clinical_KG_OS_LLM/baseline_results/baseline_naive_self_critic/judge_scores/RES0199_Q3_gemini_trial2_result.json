  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary diagnosis to rule out and identifies 'loss of smell' as the characteristic symptom, matching the gold answer's factual conclusions.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main symptoms (headache, cough, GI issues) but misses 'fatigue' which was included in the gold answer's constellation. It also omits the pertinent negatives mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer refers to a 'knowledge graph' that was not provided in the source transcript or prompt context. While the clinical conclusion is correct, the reference to an external knowledge graph constitutes a minor hallucination of the source material's structure.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the user's question with specific references to the patient's symptoms and the doctor's statements."
