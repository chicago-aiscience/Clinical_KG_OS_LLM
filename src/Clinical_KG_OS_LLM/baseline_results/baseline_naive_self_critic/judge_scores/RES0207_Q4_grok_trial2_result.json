  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists specific denied symptoms (chest pain, feeling faint, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea, sputum production, prior SOB episodes) addressing cardiac, infectious, GI differentials. Generated Answer incorrectly focuses on confirmed symptoms (SOB, dry cough) as screened/denied, misrepresents seizure relation as a denial, and fails to list any actual denied symptoms or accurately link negatives to differentials. Contradicts Gold on core facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: denied chest pain/faint (cardiac), taste/smell/sore throat/runny nose/contacts/travel (infectious), nausea/belly pain/diarrhea (GI), no sputum, no prior episodes. Generated covers 0% of these, instead discussing affirmed SOB/cough and irrelevant seizure relation.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated misrepresents transcript: SOB/cough confirmed [P-1,P-2,P-4], not denied; patient said 'I don't know if related' about seizure [P-8], not a clear denial screened by doctor. No citations for actual denied symptoms. Hallucinates framing of confirmed symptoms as 'screenings for denial' and ties to differentials incorrectly.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for denied symptoms/exposures and differentials they address; Generated discusses confirmed chief complaints and seizure (not screened/denied symptoms), vaguely mentions cardiac/infectious without linking to negatives, missing GI entirely."
