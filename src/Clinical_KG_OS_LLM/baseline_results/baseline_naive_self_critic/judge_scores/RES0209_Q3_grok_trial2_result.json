  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns with the Gold Answer on core facts: classic asthma symptoms (dry cough [P-1], SOB [P-1], wheezing [P-15]), increased bronchodilator use indicating worsening, triggers (exercise, cold [P-9, P-11]), and conclusion of asthma exacerbation. Minor discrepancies include: vague description of bronchodilator escalation ('a lot now' [P-1, P-9]) vs Gold's precise 'once every two weeks to 5-6 times/week' [P-8]; incorrect note that chest tightness is not explicitly in transcript (it is at P-20); addition of 'Knowledge Graph' not in Gold or transcript; family history emphasized more than in Gold. Main point correct, no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: all 4 symptoms with citations (dry cough P-1/P-14, SOB P-1/P-19, wheezing P-15, chest tightness P-20); diagnosis at age 8 (P-2/D-3); bronchodilator relief/reversible (P-1); precise escalation (P-8); wheezing > BD use (P-17); triggers (P-9/P-11); infection screening negatives (P-14/P-21-P-28); med adjustment (D-43). Covered: 3/4 symptoms (misses chest tightness cite), vague escalation, triggers. Missed: precise frequency, diagnosis age, wheezing frequency, reversible obstruction highlight, full infection rule-out (crucial for vs new condition), nighttime symptoms implied in Gold. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: symptoms [P-1, P-15], triggers [P-9, P-11], family [P-32], BD helps/ more use [P-1, P-9]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'Knowledge Graph' links (not in transcript, mentioned twice); inaccurate claim chest tightness 'not explicitly cited in transcript segments' (verifiable at D-20/P-20). No other fabrications, but these introduce minor hallucinations and error. Citations mostly accurate.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by explaining symptom combination (dry cough, SOB, wheezing, BD increase) points to asthma worsening vs new condition; structured evidence supports focus. Minor tangents: Knowledge Graph, family history, note on missing chest tightness."
