  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated, correctly describes the prompting evidence including persistent cough (P-2), flu-like symptoms transitioning to dry cough (P-14, supported by P-5/P-6/P-13), hospital employment (P-34), and colleagues' fear (P-35), and states the negative test result (P-35), fully consistent with the Gold Answer's facts with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnosis (COVID-19), persistent cough, flu-like symptoms (sore throat, mucus), hospital job, colleagues scared, negative test. Missed or partially covered: explicit patient disclosure phrasing, runny nose specifically, PPE usage and carefulness despite it, test timing at symptom onset (P-36), and staying home since testing (P-36); covers approximately 85% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript: persistent cough (P-2, P-3), flu-like symptoms/mucus/sore throat (P-5, P-6, P-13, P-14), hospital clerk (P-34), colleagues scared (P-35), COVID test negative (P-35); citations are precise with no hallucination or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question's three components (diagnosis, prompting evidence, testing results) with focused sections and no off-topic content."
