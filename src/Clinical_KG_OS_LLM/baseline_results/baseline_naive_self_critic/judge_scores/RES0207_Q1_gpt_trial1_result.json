  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the reported respiratory symptoms as sudden shortness of breath [P-1] and a dry cough [P-4], and correctly notes the neurological symptom of a seizure the prior night with a history of epilepsy [P-8]. However, it is factually incorrect regarding fever: the patient *did* provide an objective temperature measurement of 37.4°C that morning [P-5, P-6], whereas the Generated Answer states no objective measurement was provided. This is a major error because it directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) shortness of breath, (2) dry cough, (3) seizure last night, (4) epilepsy history. Key points missed/incorrect: (1) objective fever measurement 37.4°C (missed and contradicted), (2) timing details (started suddenly this morning; ~3 hours prior), (3) patient felt fine after the seizure, (4) other contextual negatives listed in the Gold Answer (not required by the question but included in Gold). Because the fever measurement is a central part of the question and is omitted/incorrect, completeness is substantially reduced.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations (SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure/epilepsy [P-8]). However, the claim that the patient did not provide an objective fever measurement is not only unsupported but directly contradicted by [P-5]. This is a significant unfaithful statement.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the requested domains (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and fever measurement) with no notable tangential content."

  "summary": "The answer is relevant and mostly captures the respiratory and neurologic complaints, but it contains a major contradiction about the fever measurement (37.4°C was reported), substantially reducing correctness, completeness, and faithfulness."
