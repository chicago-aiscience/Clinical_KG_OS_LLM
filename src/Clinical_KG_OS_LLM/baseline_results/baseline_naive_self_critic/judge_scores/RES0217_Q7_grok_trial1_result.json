  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts from the Gold Answer and transcript without contradictions or errors. Details like hiking on Friday, gardening on Saturday, uncertainty of attachment, discovery prompting visit, tick size comparisons, prior bullseye rash and antibiotics, and current localized symptoms are all correct. Minor citation nuance (no rash cited to P-1/P-6, though accurate in P-6) does not introduce factual inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: hiking Fri/gardening Sat, uncertainty/hope from hiking, brought tick in container, >72hrs estimate, prior ~10yrs bullseye rash/antibiotics, prior tick quite swollen, current maybe little bit/not as much engorged, no larger rash, location behind knee. Missed or partial: explicit 'earlier today' discovery due to specific soreness prompting inspection, precise location 'joint behind where it bends', 'pretty small' [P-4], doctor's 'little grape' engorgement confirmation [D-4]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., P-1 for activities/location/symptoms, P-3 for prior experience/comparison, D-6 for 72hrs/antibiotics, P-6 for no rash). No hallucinations; doctor's prophylactic antibiotics mentioned is grounded in D-6. Minor citation overlap (P-1 for no rash) but factually supported elsewhere.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response into 'Timeline of Tick Exposure and Presentation' and 'Comparison of Current Episode vs. Past Experience', focusing solely on exposure timeline, discovery/presentation, and symptom/engorgement contrasts without off-topic content."
