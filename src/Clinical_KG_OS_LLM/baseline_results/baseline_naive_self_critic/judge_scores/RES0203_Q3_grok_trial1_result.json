  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, mild dry cough) matching Gold exactly [P-1]. The connection to COVID-19 suspicion via D-39 quote is identical. Test ordered as swab [D-39] matches. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold; all stated facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: combination of three symptoms (yes), doctor's explicit connection in D-39 (yes), swab test ordered (yes). Missed: patient initially raising COVID concern [P-1], thorough ROS confirming absences (fever, SOB, etc.), 'pretty well' summary [D-16], narrow symptom profile reasoning, self-isolation instruction. Covers core ~80% of Gold's main elements but omits supportive details on ROS and context.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: symptoms from [P-1], doctor's statement and test order from [D-39]. Citations accurate. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by specifying symptom combination, doctor's connection via quote, and test method (swab). Structured response with headings focuses precisely on query without off-topic content."
