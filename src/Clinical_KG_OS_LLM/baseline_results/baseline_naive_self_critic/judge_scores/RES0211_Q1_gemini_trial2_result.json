  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the content of the transcript. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain denials for sputum production, nausea, joint pain, or rashes, whereas those denials are clearly present (P-5/6, P-11, P-13, and P-10). It also misses the symptom of 'feeling hot' (fever), which is a significant part of the patient's report in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key reported symptoms (feeling hot/fever, tired) and fails to list the specific denials requested in the prompt, despite them being available in the text. It covers less than 50% of the key clinical points mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a major hallucination of absence, claiming that the transcript lacks specific segments and explicit denials that are clearly visible in the source text (turns D-5 through D-13).",
    "relevance": "While the answer is structured to address the specific parts of the question (Reported vs Denied), it fails to provide the requested information for the 'Denied' section, instead incorrectly claiming the information is unavailable."
