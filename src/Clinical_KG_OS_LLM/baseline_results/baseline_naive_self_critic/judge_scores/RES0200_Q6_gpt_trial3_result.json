  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the plan stated in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function labs, ABG, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation measurement with supplemental oxygen as needed, continuation of bronchodilators, and addition of steroids and antibiotics. It also correctly includes a COVID swab from [D-52]. Minor issue: COVID swab is presented under “Therapeutic Interventions” rather than as a diagnostic test, but this does not materially change factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Covers essentially all COPD-exacerbation management elements from the Gold Answer: ordered labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG), COVID swab, chest X-ray, O2 sat monitoring with oxygen PRN, continuation of bronchodilators, and new steroids + antibiotics. It does not include the additional note from [D-37] about ongoing blood pressure monitoring (included in the Gold Answer as an additional monitoring recommendation), nor does it mention the stated turnaround time for COVID results (24–48h).",
    "faithfulness": "All included items are directly supported by the transcript, primarily [D-52] (and bronchodilator examples supported by [P-11]). No clear hallucinated tests or treatments are added.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing labs, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions for the COPD exacerbation; no meaningful off-topic content."
