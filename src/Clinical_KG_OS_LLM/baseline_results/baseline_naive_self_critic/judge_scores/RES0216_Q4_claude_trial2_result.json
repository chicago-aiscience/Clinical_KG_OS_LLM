    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemia as the condition placed lower on the differential, which aligns with the Gold Answer's 'cardiac ischemic picture.' It accurately cites the absence of chest pain as key evidence. However, it misses several important details: (1) it doesn't mention the patient didn't get 'out of breath with exercise' despite some difficulty breathing, (2) it omits the pertinent negatives of anxiety, sweating, and impending doom that were screened, and (3) it doesn't fully capture the distinction between tightness and pain as emphasized in the Gold Answer. The core facts are correct but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50-60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the condition and mentions chest tightness versus pain. However, it significantly omits: (1) the specific screening questions about anxiety, sweating, and impending doom [D-6, P-6], (2) the nuanced observation about exertional dyspnea ('didn't really get out of breath with exercise'), (3) the patient's expression of relief about it not being the heart [P-35], and (4) the comprehensive framing of 'pertinent negatives' as a category of evidence. The answer provides a basic framework but lacks the depth of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The claim about chest tightness [P-1, P-7], absence of pain [P-5, D-36], and the condition being cardiac ischemia are all verifiable. However, the reference to a 'knowledge graph' with specific relationships like '[FINDING] no pain --[RULES_OUT]--> [DIAGNOSIS] cardiac ischemia' appears to be fabricated or refers to external information not present in the provided transcript. This is a minor hallucination that doesn't substantially affect the overall faithfulness, as the main clinical reasoning is accurate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying the specific condition (cardiac ischemia), the nature of chest complaints (tightness without pain), and absent symptoms (no pain). It stays focused on the question asked without significant tangents. However, it could be more comprehensive in addressing 'both the nature of the patient's chest complaints and the absence of certain symptoms' as the question specifically requests multiple absent symptoms beyond just pain."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemia as the deprioritized condition and accurately cites the key evidence of chest tightness without pain. It is well-grounded in the transcript with proper citations. However, it lacks completeness by omitting several important pertinent negatives (anxiety, sweating, impending doom) and the nuanced observation about exertional symptoms. The reference to a 'knowledge graph' appears to be fabricated information not present in the transcript. Overall, the answer provides a solid basic response but misses significant details that would make it comprehensive."
