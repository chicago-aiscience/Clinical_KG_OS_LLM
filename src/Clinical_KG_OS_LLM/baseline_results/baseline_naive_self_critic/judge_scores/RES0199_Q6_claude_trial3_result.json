  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer. All key facts - the COVID-19 swab, 24-48 hour results timeframe, 14-day isolation, positive-result contact tracing trigger, alternative viral illness possibility, and all supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for pain) - are correctly stated and align with the Gold Answer. The Generated Answer appropriately cites [D-52] throughout.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer. It includes: (1) diagnostic test ordered (COVID-19 swab), (2) specific isolation duration (14 days), (3) conditions for contact tracing (positive results), (4) alternative diagnosis consideration (another viral illness), and (5) all supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for pain). The only minor omission is the specific '24 to 48 hours' timeframe for results, which while mentioned in the Gold Answer, is a minor detail that doesn't affect the overall completeness of the management plan.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the source transcript, specifically in [D-52]. The citations are accurate and appropriate. The mention of the Knowledge Graph adds supplementary context but doesn't introduce hallucinated information - it merely confirms relationships already present in the transcript. No fabricated content is present; all information is grounded in the doctor's actual statements.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about the complete management plan. It is well-organized with clear sections covering diagnostic testing, self-isolation, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care recommendations. The structured format enhances clarity without introducing irrelevant content. The brief Knowledge Graph references add context without detracting from relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent, comprehensive response to the question with strong accuracy, near-complete coverage of key points, perfect grounding in the source material, and direct relevance. The only minor gap is the omission of the specific '24 to 48 hours' timeframe for test results, which represents a minor detail that slightly affects completeness but does not significantly impact the overall quality of the response."
