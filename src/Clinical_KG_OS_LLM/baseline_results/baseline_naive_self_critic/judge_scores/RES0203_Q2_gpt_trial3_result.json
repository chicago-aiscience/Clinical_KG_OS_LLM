  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on the core facts: the patient did not try any OTC meds/treatments before the visit, and the clinician recommended COVID testing with a swab, noted the turnaround time (1–2 days), and instructed self-isolation until results (and possibly longer if symptoms persist). Minor issues: it infers/specifies a “nasal swab” whereas the transcript only says “a swab,” and it cites [P-1] as support for no home treatments rather than the explicit denial at [P-9].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) patient tried nothing beforehand; (2) COVID test via swab; (3) results in a day or two; (4) self-isolation until results and possibly longer if symptomatic. Key points missed: (a) explicit note that the patient takes no regular medications [P-24], and (b) the clinician’s mention that there might be additional tests and they would review with the supervising doctor before finalizing the plan [D-40].",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript, especially the testing recommendation, turnaround time, and isolation instructions. However, two elements reduce faithfulness: (1) “nasal swab” is not explicitly stated (only “swab” is), and (2) it includes a non-transcript reference “[Knowledge Graph],” which is not part of the provided source and therefore is not verifiable from the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question by describing what the patient tried before the visit (nothing) and what the doctor recommended during the consultation (COVID swab testing) along with the associated instructions (isolation and timing). No meaningful irrelevant content."

  "summary": "Overall strong and on-target, accurately capturing the main pre-visit and in-visit actions, with minor omissions (no-regular-meds, possible further tests/supervising physician) and small faithfulness issues (\"nasal\" swab and non-transcript \"Knowledge Graph\" reference)."
