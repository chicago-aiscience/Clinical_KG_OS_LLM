    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the COVID swab test, 14-day isolation, and specific mention of isolating from the younger sister, all directly matching facts in the Gold Answer and transcript without any errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: COVID swab with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation specifically from younger sister, household includes parents and sister, ER precautions for high temp/neuro symptoms/weakness/dizziness/fainting, false-negative possibility and other viral illness, no medications/supportive care/wait for results, school requires test.
