  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the missed dose of Keppra as connected to the seizure via patient report and accurately quotes P-9 as evidence of the patient's recognition of the causal link, matching Gold's core facts. Minor discrepancies include introducing 'knowledge graph and clinical notes' not present in Gold or transcript, overstating 'frequency of seizures linked to adherence' (Gold implies infrequency but ties specifically to this miss), and omitting P-24 details on routine disruption, but no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers Gold's key points on causal connection (missed dose to seizure) and main evidence (P-9 quote, patient's explicit link); mentions P-8 and P-23 for context. Misses: specific same-night timing and routine disruption explanation [P-24], infrequency implying unusual event [P-9], spontaneous context of response to D-9, and note on no clinician confirmation. Approximately 60-70% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about P-8, P-9 quote, and P-23 Keppra are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. 'Missed dose as precipitating factor' is plausible from patient statement. 'Frequency linked to adherence' is interpretive but grounded in P-9 context. However, 'provided knowledge graph and clinical notes' is fully hallucinated (absent from transcript/input), introducing unverifiable fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses both question parts: connection of missed dose to seizure and specific transcript evidence (quotes/exchanges) of patient's recognition, with no off-topic content."
