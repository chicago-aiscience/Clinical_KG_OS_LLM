  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and the COVID test from [P-35] as the specific test used, matching the Gold Answer. It accurately notes the negative result implied in [P-35]. However, it incorrectly states that the timing of the test relative to symptom onset is 'not explicitly detailed,' despite [P-36] clearly stating 'I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago,' which directly contradicts the Gold Answer's precise citation. Workplace concerns partially align (hospital job [P-34], scared coworkers [P-35]), but miss details like PPE use [P-17], staying home post-test, eagerness to return without coughing [P-36], and medication desire driven by workplace needs. Additionally, referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' is unsupported by the transcript. Overall, core facts are correct, but there are notable factual discrepancies and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) COVID-19 ruled out via negative 'covid test' [P-35]; (2) test at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior [P-36]; (3) hospital clerk job [P-34]; (4) PPE use [P-17]; (5) coworkers scared [P-35]; (6) staying home since test [P-36]; (7) wants to return without coughing, partly motivating meds [P-35,P-36]. Generated covers: (1) fully; (2) partially (links to 2-week cough but denies explicit timing); (3) yes; (5) yes; infers anxieties/documentation. Misses: (4), (6), (7), explicit timing citation. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about condition/test/negative result verifiable in [P-35]; hospital job in [P-34]; scared coworkers in [P-35]. Timing claim cites [P-2,P-35] but inaccurately states 'not explicitly detailed' when [P-36] explicitly details it ('when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago'). 'Knowledge Graph' is entirely absent from transcript (hallucination). Inferred 'exclusionary documentation' plausible but not directly stated. Multiple issues: hallucination and misstatement of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured to directly address each element of the question (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns) with focused responses, no off-topic content, though some answers are incomplete."
