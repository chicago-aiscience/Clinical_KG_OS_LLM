  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the two proposed procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) with correct citations [D-37, D-39] matching Gold. Rationale for COVID swab quotes transcript precisely and interprets as standard protocol, consistent with Gold's 'institutional protocol... for anyone with these symptoms.' Minor rephrasing like 'examine the lungs' aligns with context of cough/lungs [D-37]. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: both procedures (chest X-ray, COVID swab) and exact rationale for swab from Gold [D-39]. Includes citations and ties to symptoms [P-2]. Misses Gold's details like patient reassurance on swab discomfort, X-ray explanation as 'picture inside,' full plan to arrange/discuss with supervising doctor, no treatments prescribed, and med history confirmation (though question premises no meds). Covers ~85-90% of Gold's content, primarily the core question elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: chest X-ray proposal [D-37], COVID swab [D-39] with quote, symptoms [P-2]. 'Examine the lungs' plausible from cough context and 'chest X Ray.' No hallucinations; 'knowledge graph' is extraneous phrasing but does not introduce false facts. Citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing proposed procedures and providing specific rationale for COVID swab with transcript support. Structured response focused, no off-topic content."
