{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the medication (bronchodilator), the administration method (inhaler/puffer), and the type of medication the doctor asked about (daily controller). These facts are fully consistent with the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all parts of the multi-part question. It identifies the bronchodilator, its administration, and the missing daily controller. While it doesn't include the specific frequency data (5-6 times a week) or the exact phrasing 'every day no matter what' mentioned in the gold answer, it captures the essential clinical information required by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are supported by the transcript. The use of 'bronchodilator' (P-1), 'inhaler' (implied by puffer in D-7), and the discussion of a daily medication (D-5) are all grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific questions asked without excessive extraneous information, though it adds some context regarding acute relief which is helpful for clarity."
