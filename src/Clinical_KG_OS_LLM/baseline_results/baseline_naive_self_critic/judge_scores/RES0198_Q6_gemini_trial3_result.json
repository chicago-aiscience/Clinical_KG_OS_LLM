  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), the supportive care (hydration, Tylenol cold), the diagnostic test (COVID swab with 48-hour timeline), and public health instructions (isolation and follow-up).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few minor details present in the gold answer: the expectation that symptoms take 'a few weeks' to resolve and the doctor's remark that there is 'not much that we can do besides supportive care.'",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically turn [D-39]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure (Diagnosis, Supportive Care, Diagnostic Test, Public Health Guidance) perfectly."
