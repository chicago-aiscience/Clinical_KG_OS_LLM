  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the two diagnostic tests (X-ray and COVID swab), the need for consultation with a supervising physician, and the return to the room for next steps. It does not contain any factual errors compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but omits the initial part of the plan mentioned in [D-1], where the doctor states they will perform a physical examination of the patient's lungs and heart before consulting the supervisor. The Gold Answer includes this initial step of the visit structure.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It includes specific details such as the mention of 'Roller Coaster Tycoon' and correctly cites the transcript sections [D-1, D-37, D-39]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly relevant, structured clearly into categories that address each component of the prompt (tests, consultation, and follow-up/reassurance)."
