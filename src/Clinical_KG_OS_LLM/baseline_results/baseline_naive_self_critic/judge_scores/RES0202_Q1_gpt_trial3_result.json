  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The mother-reported symptom list is partly correct (dry cough, fever >100°F, fatigue/tiredness, mild runny nose, possible loss of taste). However, the answer makes a major incorrect claim: it states that “none” of the example symptoms (wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, GI complaints) were explicitly asked about. In the transcript, the doctor explicitly asked about wheezing (D-7), shortness of breath (D-8), chest pain/heart racing (D-13), sore throat (D-14), chills/night sweats (D-19), bowel changes/diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool (D-21–D-22), and nausea/vomiting (D-23), and these were denied. The answer also incorrectly implies the mother did not explicitly deny dizziness/fainting—she did deny them (P-25). These errors contradict the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Mother-reported symptoms: includes cough, fever, fatigue, runny nose, possible taste change; partially captures decreased appetite but does not clearly include the explicit “doesn’t seem to have a big appetite” point (P-15) as in the Gold Answer, and does not note the key nuance that shortness of breath was uncertain (P-8).\nDenied/asked symptoms: misses most of the Gold Answer’s pertinent negatives (sputum/blood, wheeze, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, rash/skin changes, GI complaints, urinary changes, dizziness/fainting, confusion/memory loss, vision/hearing fine) and instead incorrectly claims these were not asked.\nOverall, it covers only a minority of required items.",
    "faithfulness": "The response contains multiple statements that are directly contradicted by the transcript (e.g., claiming wheezing/sore throat/chest pain/chills/GI symptoms were not asked when they clearly were). It also adds an irrelevant/unsupported framing (“knowledge graph”). The neurological-symptom discussion is partially grounded (doctor mentions seizures/weak/dizzy/fainting in D-44), but the answer’s claim that denials were only implied is contradicted by explicit denials earlier (P-25). Overall, several key claims are not faithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to address both parts of the question (reported symptoms and doctor-asked/denied symptoms) and largely stays on-topic. It includes some extra focus on neurological symptoms, which is still within the scope of ‘symptoms asked about,’ though not the core examples. Despite being on-topic, it fails to provide the requested denied symptom list accurately."
