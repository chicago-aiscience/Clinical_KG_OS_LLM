  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple factual inaccuracies versus the Gold Answer and transcript: (1) It misstates the timeline, saying symptoms developed after returning home on Thursday; the transcript says he came home from school on Wednesday and symptoms started that night [P-1]. (2) It incorrectly claims the transcript does not indicate whether the school notified the family of exposures; the mother explicitly said the school had not contacted them about anything [P-39]. (3) It fails to report the mother’s clear statement that there were no known sick contacts outside of school (“we know for sure, not outside of school”) [P-38], and instead substitutes irrelevant information about not running outside [P-8]. Overall, the core factual conclusions about school notification and sick contacts are wrong or missing.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements missed or inadequately covered: suspected acquisition at school/COVID concern [P-2]; onset after returning from school Wednesday [P-1] (partially but incorrectly stated); explicit statement of no known sick contacts outside school [P-38]; uncertainty about sick contacts at school (“kinda hard to say”) [P-38]; school did not notify of exposures [P-39]; school required COVID test to return and to inform other families if exposure [P-41]; additional narrowing factors (no travel [P-40], no home environmental exposures [P-37]) are not mentioned. The Generated Answer covers only the vague idea that school could be a source, and even that with an incorrect day.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or are misleading relative to the transcript: (1) Claiming no transcript information about school notification directly contradicts [P-39]. (2) Using [P-8] (not running outside) as if it addresses sick contacts outside school is not supported. While it does not invent large new facts, it omits explicit transcript details and makes contradictory claims, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at the question (school attendance, sick contacts, notification), but it includes irrelevant content (not running outside) and fails to address required parts (school notification and outside-of-school sick contacts) accurately."
