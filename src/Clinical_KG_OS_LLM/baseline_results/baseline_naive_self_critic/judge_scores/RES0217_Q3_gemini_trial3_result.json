  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the exposure history, duration of attachment, and prior history. However, its 'Geographic Risk Assessment' section focuses on general tick habitats (D-18) rather than the specific assessment mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript regarding the location 'Strathroy' and the 'Ontario Lyme disease distribution map' (D-13), which were the actual clinical triggers for the recommendation.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific geographic location (Strathroy), the consultation of the Ontario distribution map, the patient's specific mention that all ticks in the area are now considered carriers, and the plan for laboratory species identification. It covers about 60% of the nuanced detail provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is faithful to the transcript and includes accurate citations for the points it covers. It does not hallucinate information, though it slightly overstates the prior history as 'known susceptibility' which is an interpretation rather than a direct quote.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's multi-part question, organizing the information into the requested categories."
