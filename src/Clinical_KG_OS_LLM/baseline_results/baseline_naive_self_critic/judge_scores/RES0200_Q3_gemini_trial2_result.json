  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the three cardinal symptoms (cough, dyspnea, sputum changes) and the doctor's synthesis in D-52.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all the main points, including the specific symptoms and the doctor's reasoning. It is slightly less detailed than the gold answer regarding the specifics of the patient's history (it omits the 5-year duration and specific inhalers like Ventolin and Spiriva) and the doctor's inferred infectious component related to the sputum color change.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using accurate quotes and referencing the correct speaker turns ([P-1], [P-8], [P-6], [D-52]).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question (the symptoms/history combination and the doctor's linking logic)."
