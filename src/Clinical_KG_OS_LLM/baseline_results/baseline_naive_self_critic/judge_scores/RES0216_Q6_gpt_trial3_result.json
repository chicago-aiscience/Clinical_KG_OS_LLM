  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states asthma recurrence is top of differential and cardiac ischemia is lower on the differential; the Generated Answer incorrectly says cardiac ischemia \"remains a primary differential diagnosis.\" The plan in the transcript is to make rescue puffers available (the patient currently does not have an as-needed inhaler); the Generated Answer incorrectly says to use the patient’s \"existing rescue puffers,\" which contradicts P-17/P-18. The remainder (planned lung auscultation and reassessment if no improvement) aligns with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covers the required core elements: (1) assessment of asthma recurrence, (2) physical exam including listening to lungs, (3) first-step therapeutic trial with rescue inhaler, and (4) contingency to reassess/consider other directions if not improved. Misses/underemphasizes: that the inhaler needs to be obtained because the patient lacks it, the explicit stepwise \"one thing at a time\" framing, and mention of possible further investigations/consulting the supervising physician (present in Gold Answer).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or are misstated relative to the transcript: cardiac ischemia described as a \"primary\" differential (transcript says it is lower), and implying the patient has an existing rescue inhaler (transcript says he does not). Also adds interpretation that hoarseness/phlegm are \"consistent\" with asthma as the doctor’s view, which is not explicitly stated. Most other points are supported by D-35/D-36.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses what was asked: overall assessment, planned physical exam component(s), initial treatment step, and contingency if not improved. Minor extra interpretive material, but not substantially off-topic."

  "summary": "The answer captures the main intended plan (lung exam, trial rescue inhaler, reassess if no benefit) but contains important inaccuracies about cardiac ischemia being a primary differential and about the patient already having a rescue inhaler, reducing correctness and faithfulness."
