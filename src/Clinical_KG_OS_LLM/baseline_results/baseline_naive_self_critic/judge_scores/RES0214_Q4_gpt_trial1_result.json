  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The diagnostic test is correctly identified as a COVID-19 swab. However, the rationale for *prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza* is not accurately captured. In the transcript, the doctor’s explicit justification for COVID-first is the likely household transmission pattern (husband had similar symptoms first, then the patient) and the need to treat it as potentially transmissible until ruled out. The Generated Answer instead frames the prioritization mainly around the nonspecific presence of fever and sore throat (a general infectious-workup point), which does not explain why COVID is prioritized over influenza in this case.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) COVID swab ordered.\nMisses key Gold Answer points: (1) household transmission rationale (“if your husband got it, and you have it…”), (2) self-isolation/containment rationale while awaiting rule-out, (3) influenza discussed only after COVID rule-out emphasis and in context of no flu shot. Overall, it captures only a minority of the rationale elements.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made are largely supported by the transcript (COVID swab; fever/sore throat; ruling out infectious causes; quote that COVID is first to rule out). The main issue is not fabrication but misattribution/overgeneralization: it implies symptom profile is the reason for COVID being prioritized over influenza, whereas the transcript emphasizes household spread and public-health precaution.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question (test ordered and rationale), with no notable irrelevant content."
