  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea, despite explicit mentions (e.g., [D-10], [D-15], [D-16], [D-17]). It lists irrelevant symptoms like cough (not fully denied), appetite, and taste, which contradict the Gold Answer's list of pertinent negatives. Differentiation explanations are partially plausible but factually inaccurate relative to Gold and include hallucinations like 'knowledge graph'. Significant contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers 8 specific denied symptoms with citations (runny nose/congestion, vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling) and their diagnostic role. Generated covers none of these accurately, instead mentioning cough, appetite, taste (not key points), missing 100% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about missing symptoms in transcript are false (verifiable in [D-10,P-10], [D-15,P-15], etc.). Cough denial misrepresented ([P-8] admits possible starting cough). References non-existent 'knowledge graph' and 'transcript segments'. Multiple hallucinations and unverifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "Addresses the question structure (lists symptoms, explains differentiation) but with fabricated content; tangents to wrong symptoms and assumptions, partially off-topic due to errors."
