  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It misidentifies symptoms as 'constitutional symptoms' - fatigue and sleep disturbance are mentioned but not properly contextualized as secondary to the cough itself. The answer incorrectly focuses on chest pain from coughing as a constitutional symptom when Gold Answer clearly identifies night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis as the key constitutional symptoms screened. The Generated Answer also fabricates the concept of 'Feline/Zoonotic Tuberculosis' as a screening concern when the cat allergy mentioned was unrelated to TB screening. The answer completely misses the critical exposure screenings: sick contacts, travel history, and IV drug use.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 30% of the key points from Gold Answer. It fails to mention: night sweats screening [D-5], weight loss and loose-fitting clothes [D-6 to D-8], hemoptysis [D-10], sick contacts at pole dancing class [D-14], recent sick contacts [D-15], roommate illness [D-32], travel history [D-33-34], IV drug use [D-40], cocaine/heroin use [D-39], stiff neck [D-18], nausea/vomiting [D-17], and the critical connection between these symptoms and TB screening. It incorrectly focuses on cat exposure as an exposure risk when this was about allergies, not infectious disease screening.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple hallucinations. It fabricates 'Feline/Zoonotic Tuberculosis' as a concern, which is not supported by the transcript. It mischaracterizes cat exposure (which was about allergies [D-27-28]) as an infectious disease exposure risk. The answer invents a 'knowledge graph' that doesn't exist in the source material. It also misrepresents fatigue and sleep disturbance as primary constitutional symptoms when the transcript shows these are secondary to the cough itself [P-19]. The answer fails to ground its claims in actual transcript citations for most screening questions.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question but with significant deficiencies. It attempts to identify constitutional symptoms and exposure risks but focuses on wrong elements (chest pain, cat exposure, fabricated conditions). It does address the serious conditions aspect but inaccurately. About 40% of the content is relevant to the actual question, while the rest is either off-topic or incorrectly interpreted."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates poor quality across all dimensions. It misidentifies the key constitutional symptoms (missing night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis) and exposure risks (missing sick contacts, travel, IV drug use), instead focusing on secondary symptoms and irrelevant details like cat allergies. It fabricates medical concepts like 'Feline/Zoonotic Tuberculosis' and misrepresents the significance of various screening questions. The answer covers less than 30% of the Gold Answer's key points and contains multiple hallucinations not supported by the transcript. While it attempts to address the question structure, the factual errors and omissions make it significantly inadequate for clinical evaluation purposes."
