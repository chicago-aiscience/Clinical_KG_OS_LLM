  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer falsely claims the transcript ends at [P-26] and that no next steps are discussed, directly contradicting the Gold Answer which accurately cites [D-37] and [D-38] where the doctor explicitly outlines consulting another doctor, returning shortly to discuss tests and next steps; this is a complete factual inaccuracy with no alignment to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: doctor will review with another doctor ([D-37]), collaborative decision-making, return shortly to discuss ([D-37],[D-38]), possible tests and management plan ([D-37]), no specific tests ordered, patient acknowledgment ([P-37]). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying the existence of the content.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends at [P-26] with no further doctor responses, but the full transcript provided continues to [D-38] including the exact next steps in [D-37]; all claims about transcript content are unverifiable and fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The answer does not address the question about next steps, decision-makers, or follow-ups; it off-topic-ly asserts the question cannot be answered due to a nonexistent transcript limitation."
