  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors relative to the Gold Answer and transcript. Most importantly, it incorrectly states that “none” of the exemplar symptoms (wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, GI complaints) were explicitly asked about by the doctor; in the transcript the doctor clearly asked and the mother denied wheezing [D-7/P-7], chest pain/heart racing [D-13/P-13], sore throat [D-14/P-14], chills/night sweats [D-19/P-19], and multiple GI symptoms (bowel changes/diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool [D-21/D-22/P-22], nausea/vomiting [D-23/P-23]). It also omits/incorrectly handles other explicitly denied symptoms (no sputum/blood [D-6/P-6], urinary changes [D-24/P-24], dizziness/fainting [D-25/P-25], confusion/memory loss [D-26/P-26], rash/skin changes [D-20/P-20]). While it correctly notes dry cough, fever, fatigue, mild runny nose, and possible loss of taste, the central “asked and denied” portion is largely wrong.",
    "completeness": "For mother-reported symptoms, it captures cough, fever, fatigue, runny nose, and possible loss of taste, but it misses or inadequately represents: decreased appetite explicitly discussed at swallowing/appetite question [P-15], and the uncertainty around shortness of breath [P-8]. For doctor-asked-and-denied symptoms, it misses most key negatives listed in the Gold Answer (sputum/blood, wheeze, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, rash, GI symptoms, urinary changes, dizziness/fainting, confusion/memory loss, vision/hearing being fine). Overall it covers only a minority of the Gold Answer’s key points, especially in the negatives section.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in (and in fact contradict) the transcript: claiming the doctor did not ask about wheezing/sore throat/chest pain/chills/GI complaints is directly contradicted by the dialogue. It also adds an unsupported interpretation that the mother’s responses “implied” lack of seizures/weakness/dizziness/fainting in relation to [D-44]; the explicit denials for dizziness/fainting occur earlier at [D-25/P-25], not as an implication from [P-8]/[P-15]. The phrase “Based on the transcript and knowledge graph” introduces non-transcript basis. These issues constitute multiple unfaithful/hallucinated or contradicted claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer is intended to address the question (reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and explicitly asked-about-and-denied symptoms). However, it fails to provide the requested denied symptoms list accurately and instead incorrectly asserts they were not asked, which undermines its usefulness for the specific query. Most content is on-topic, but the core requested component is not properly answered."
