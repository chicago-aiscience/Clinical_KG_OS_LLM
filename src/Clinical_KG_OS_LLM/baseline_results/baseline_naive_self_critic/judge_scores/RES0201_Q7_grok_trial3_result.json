  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer provides precise timeline: sore throat Day 1 (4 days ago, worsening over 4 days), muscle aches/fatigue shortly after, reduced taste Day 3 (2 days ago, constant), breathing difficulty Day 4 (yesterday, constant and worsening). Generated Answer correctly identifies sore throat onset 4 days ago but vaguely groups 'new symptom or worsening yesterday' without explicitly naming breathing difficulty or its details; misplaces muscle aches and taste as 'current status' without their specific timelines; omits fatigue distinction, self-treatment failure, and sore throat progression details; significant discrepancies in timeline and symptom details.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: sore throat Day1/worsening/food issues; aches/fatigue immediately after; taste Day3 constant/new/no smell; breathing Day4 constant/worsening/new/alarming; self-treatment failed; overall progression. Generated covers sore throat onset/severity partially, vague yesterday symptom (breathing), muscle aches and taste mentions; misses aches timing (immediately after), taste timing (2 days), breathing specifics, fatigue, self-treatment, sore throat worsening explicitly; covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: sore throat details [P-2], yesterday onset [P-8], aches [P-25], taste [P-19]; but introduces unnecessary vagueness ('only \"that\"' despite clear breathing context [P-7/P-8]), ignores explicit timings for aches [P-26 'immediately after'], taste [P-20 'two days ago']; infers COVID context [D-43] accurately but speculates 'likely' breathing; some plausible but ungrounded timeline placements; minor hallucinations in vagueness and omissions.",
    "relevance": "Directly attempts chronological structure starting with sore throat, addresses symptom development and some severity, but vague on specifics, order incomplete, minor tangent to COVID inference; mostly focused on question."
