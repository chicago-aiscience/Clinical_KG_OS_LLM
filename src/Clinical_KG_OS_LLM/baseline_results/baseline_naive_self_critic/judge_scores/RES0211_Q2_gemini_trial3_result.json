  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The information provided about Claritin and allergy shots is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer. However, the response fails to mention the second medication Jessica is currently taking, the oral contraceptive 'Deyo'.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers about 50-60% of the key points. It correctly identifies Claritin (carrying) and the allergy shots (past treatment), but it completely omits the birth control medication 'Deyo' (taking), which was specifically mentioned in the transcript [P-25 to P-28]. It also omits the mention of not carrying an EpiPen.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. Citations [P-16], [P-20], and [P-25] are used correctly and reflect the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for medication names, indications, and dosing/frequency, though it is incomplete in its list of medications."
