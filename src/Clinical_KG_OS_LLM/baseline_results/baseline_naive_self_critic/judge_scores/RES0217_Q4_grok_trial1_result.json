  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies bullseye rash absence ([D-6], supported by [P-6] though cited [P-1]), joint pain screening and denial ([D-7], accurate though cites [P-1] instead of [P-7]), and fever/illness screening ([D-8], partially accurate but stretches [P-14] implication instead of direct [P-8]/[P-18]). No contradictions, but misses headaches ([D-19]/[P-19]) and other points like no additional bites. Diagnostics match core proposals (physical exam, tick ID, blood work [D-18]). Minor citation discrepancies and omissions, but core facts consistent with Gold. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: bullseye rash (yes), joint pain (yes), fever/illness (partial), physical exam (yes), tick ID (yes), blood work (yes). Missed: headaches ([D-19]), feeling well otherwise explicitly ([D-18]/[P-18]), no other bites ([P-9]), physician consult ([D-13]/[D-22]), tick details ([P-1], deer tick [D-5]). Covers ~70% of key points (6/9 major items). Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: rash/joint/fever screenings in transcript; diagnostics directly from [D-18]. Citations sometimes indirect (e.g., [P-1] vs direct denials [P-6]/[P-7]/[P-8]; [P-14] implies but not direct for illness). 'Knowledge graph' not in transcript (hallucination). Patient distinctions (skin vs joint) accurate from [P-1]. Some plausible stretches but grounded overall, one clear extra. Score: 3.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structured around clinical features absent and diagnostic tests proposed, using headings matching question components, no tangents or off-topic content. Perfectly addresses query. Score: 5."
