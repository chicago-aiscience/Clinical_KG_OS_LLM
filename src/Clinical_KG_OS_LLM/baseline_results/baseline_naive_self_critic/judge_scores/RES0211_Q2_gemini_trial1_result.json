  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The facts provided about Claritin and the allergy shots are entirely consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. However, by presenting these as the 'current status', it creates a minor discrepancy by omission since it fails to list the medication Jessica actually takes regularly (Deyo).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the oral contraceptive 'Deyo' (which she takes regularly), the denial of carrying an EpiPen, and the denial of medication allergies. It only covers about 40% of the relevant medication history (Claritin and Allergy shots).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript and include accurate citations ([P-16], [P-20], [P-25]). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for current medications and past treatments, though it is incomplete."
