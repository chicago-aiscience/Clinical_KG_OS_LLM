  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the three asthma triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) and the family history (sister). It correctly interprets the increase in medication use as an exacerbation and links the pollen trigger to the suspicion of allergies.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses the specific numerical data regarding the exacerbation (the shift from once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week). It also omits the clinician's specific verbal confirmation that the allergy suspicion 'would make sense,' which is highlighted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source transcript or context for this evaluation. While the clinical facts themselves are grounded in the transcript, these citations to an external, non-existent source constitute a minor hallucination of the available evidence. It also infers 'cats and dogs' when the transcript only mentions 'no pets' and 'goldfish.'",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and clearly addresses all parts of the question, organizing the response by triggers, family history, and the current exacerbation."
