  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer and transcript. The timeline correctly identifies hiking on Friday, gardening on Saturday, uncertainty about when the tick attached, discovery 'earlier today' due to soreness, and the >72-hour attachment estimate. The comparison accurately contrasts the prior episode's bullseye rash and 'quite swollen' tick with the current episode's localized redness without bullseye rash and 'pretty small' tick with minimal engorgement. All factual details align with both the Gold Answer and source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: (1) the Friday hiking/Saturday gardening timeline, (2) uncertainty about attachment timing with hope it was from hiking, (3) discovery due to soreness behind left knee, (4) removal and bringing tick in container, (5) >72-hour attachment estimate, (6) prior episode ~10 years ago with bullseye rash and antibiotics, (7) comparison showing prior tick was 'quite swollen' vs current 'pretty small', (8) prior had bullseye rash vs current only localized redness. The Generated Answer includes all key comparative elements between episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The timeline details come from [P-1], the >72-hour estimate from [D-6], the prior episode description from [P-3], the tick engorgement comparison from [P-3][P-4], and the rash comparison from [P-3][P-6]. No hallucinated facts are present. The answer appropriately uses bracketed citations to source transcript segments, demonstrating faithful grounding in the provided material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) the timeline from Friday hiking through Saturday gardening to tick discovery and doctor presentation, and (2) the comparison of current local symptoms and tick engorgement to the prior episode ~10 years ago. All content is focused on these specific elements with no tangential information. The answer is well-structured with clear sections addressing each component of the question."
