  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies Tylenol for headaches and lists the doctor's recommendations for hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics, and NSAIDs.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several points mentioned in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention that the patient had already self-initiated hydration efforts [P-30], and it omits the doctor's specific instructions regarding the COVID-19 swab test and the 14-day isolation period [D-52], which are considered part of the management plan in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely grounded in the transcript. Every claim regarding symptoms and recommendations corresponds to the provided text. It mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the prompt context, but this does not affect the clinical accuracy of the extracted information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question regarding pre-visit medication, the target symptom, and the doctor's recommended plan."
