  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer details cough for 3 months (initially dry, intermittent, recurrent from P-2, started at pole class P-13), productive greenish gross gunk last 3 days (P-2,9,12), no blood (P-10), no foul smell noticed (P-11), wakes nightly last month causing fatigue/poor sleep (P-19-21), chest discomfort only when coughing (P-3), subjective fevers/hot at night past days no temp (P-4), impaired exercise (P-47). Denials: night sweats (P-5), wt loss/clothes loose (P-6-8), hemoptysis (P-10), N/V (P-17), stiff neck (P-18), body pain (P-19), sick contacts (P-14,15,32). Generated misstates cough duration as 1 month citing P-1 (incorrect, P-2 says 3 months), calls it chest pain vs discomfort only on cough, misses most details (dry phase, onset, no blood/smell, fevers, exercise), vague/incomplete denials (only 2 non-specific). Significant factual errors/omissions vs Gold. Score: 2.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: greenish gross sputum (partial), chest discomfort on cough (partial), fatigue/sleep disturbance (partial). Missed: 3-month duration/dry intermittent/recurrent nature/onset at pole class, productive only last 3 days, no blood/no smell, nightly waking last month specifics, fevers, exercise impairment, most denials (wt loss, hemoptysis, N/V, stiff neck, pain, contacts - only vague night sweats/wt loss). Covers ~25-30% of key points. Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: greenish gross sputum (P-9, P-2), hurts when cough (P-3), tired/sleep not great from cough (P-19), denials responses (P-5,6). Errors: cough 'one month' [P-1] - P-1 no duration, contradicts P-2 (3 months); 'knowledge graph' & linkages not in transcript (hallucination); chest pain overstated vs 'kinda hurts... not on its own'. Multiple inaccuracies/hallucinations. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures as reported respiratory/assoc symptoms (cough, chest pain, sputum, fatigue, sleep) and denied symptoms, matches question focus on respiratory cough/sputum chars and explicit denials, no off-topic content. Minor vagueness but on-topic. Score: 4."
