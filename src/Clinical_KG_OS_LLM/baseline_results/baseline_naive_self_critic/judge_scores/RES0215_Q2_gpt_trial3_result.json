  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the only medication mentioned is occasional OTC antihistamine use (Reactine/“over the counter stuff”) for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications (supported by P-36). It does not state anything incorrect about prescriptions. However, it omits key factual context from the Gold Answer about management of the current respiratory episodes (i.e., that the mother does not give her anything for the wheezing episodes and they resolve with rest), which makes the clinical picture less accurate/incomplete for the question asked.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) occasional Reactine/OTC allergy meds; (2) no prescribed medications identified. Missed: (1) explicitly that nothing is given for the current wheezing/SOB episodes (P-34) and that symptoms resolve on their own with rest (P-33); (2) confirmation of “no regular medications” aside from occasional Reactine (P-46, P-47); (3) past infections did not require antibiotics (P-16). Overall this is partial coverage of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (P-36). However, it introduces “knowledge graph information” and cites “[KG],” which is not part of the provided transcript and therefore is not verifiable from the source. Also, it loosely attributes statements to “the patient” rather than the mother, though this is a minor attribution issue. Net: mostly grounded with a small ungrounded element.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on medications/treatments and whether prescribed medication has been part of management. It does not add irrelevant tangents, but it fails to address the current respiratory-episode treatment aspect explicitly, which is a relevant part of the question."

  "summary": "Accurately notes occasional OTC Reactine use and absence of prescribed medications, but is missing several key transcript-supported details about not treating the current wheezing episodes and other medication history points, and includes a minor ungrounded “knowledge graph” reference."
