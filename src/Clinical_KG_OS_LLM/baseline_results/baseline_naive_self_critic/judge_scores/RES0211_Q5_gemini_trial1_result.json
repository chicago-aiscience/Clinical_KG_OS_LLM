  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain information about the father's allergies, the cousin's asthma, or the brother's cold. However, these are clearly documented in the transcript at [P-33], [P-30], and [P-39]/[D-58] respectively. It also claims the transcript contradicts the premise of living on a farm, despite the patient explicitly saying 'Yeah' when asked if she lives on a farm [P-43].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer regarding how the factors relate to the symptoms. It misses the connection to the brother's cold as a viral source, the family history of respiratory conditions, and the isolation of the living situation during COVID. It essentially refuses to answer the prompt's 'how' by claiming the data points do not exist.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a 'hallucination of absence.' It claims information is missing when it is present in the source text. It also misinterprets the patient's clarification that the farm has no working animals [P-48] as a contradiction of her living on a farm property [P-43].",
    "relevance": "The answer is not relevant because it fails to address the question asked. Instead of explaining the relationship between the listed factors and the symptoms, it provides an incorrect analysis of what information is present in the transcript and focuses on general allergy history which was only part of the context provided in the prompt."
