  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the specifics requested. It claims the transcript does not specify if the cough is productive or dry, but D-5 and P-5 explicitly confirm it is a 'dry cough.' Furthermore, it claims nasal discharge is not reported, whereas P-11 and P-12 explicitly mention a 'runny nose' that is 'pretty clear.' It only correctly identifies the presence of a cough and its 4-5 day duration.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the majority of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to identify the runny nose as a symptom, misses the 'dry' and 'non-productive' status of the cough, misses the 'clear' appearance of the nasal discharge, and omits all pertinent negatives (e.g., no sore throat or chest pain).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains hallucinations regarding the absence of information. It states that information is 'not reported' or 'does not specify' when that information is explicitly provided in the source transcript (D-5, P-5, P-11, P-12).",
    "relevance": "While the answer uses headings corresponding to the question, it fails to provide the relevant information requested by erroneously claiming the data is missing from the source text."
