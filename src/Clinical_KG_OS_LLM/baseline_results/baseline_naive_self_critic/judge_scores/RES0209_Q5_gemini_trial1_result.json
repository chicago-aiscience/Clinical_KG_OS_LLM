  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen) and the family history (sister). However, it identifies the duration of symptoms as the 'past week' based on P-1, whereas the gold answer and P-13 specify 'two weeks'. It also incorrectly implies the doctor's suspicion of allergies might focus on goldfish, which is not supported by the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the main triggers and family history. It misses the specific quantification of the exacerbation found in the gold answer (rescue inhaler use increasing from once every two weeks to five or six times per week). It also omits the clinician's specific verbal confirmation regarding the allergy suspicion ('that would make sense').",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer repeatedly references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the provided source transcript, constituting a significant hallucination of the source material. Furthermore, it suggests goldfish as a potential focus for the 'suspicion of undiagnosed allergies', whereas the transcript clearly links the suspicion to the mention of pollen.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, organizing the response into symptoms, triggers, family history, and environmental context."
