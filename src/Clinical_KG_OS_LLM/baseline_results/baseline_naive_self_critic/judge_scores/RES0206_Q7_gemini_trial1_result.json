  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main clinical facts from the transcript: the 3-day window of worsening, specific symptoms (increased cough, green-yellow sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis), and the patient's statement that this is her worst episode. It correctly identifies the baseline as manageable and the current state as an exacerbation.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several specific details found in the Gold Answer that provide context for the baseline and severity comparison. It omits the frequency of rescue inhaler use (once every two weeks), the specific functional impact on walking her dog, the presence of a possible fever, and the critical objective history of visiting the ED twice in three years without hospitalization. These details are key to answering 'how' the symptoms evolved and 'how' it compares to prior episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The clinical symptoms and the patient's subjective assessment of severity are all verifiable. The mention of 'knowledge graph information' is a minor meta-hallucination regarding the source of its information, but the clinical facts themselves are accurate to the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the multi-part question, organizing the response into logical sections that mirror the prompt's requirements."
