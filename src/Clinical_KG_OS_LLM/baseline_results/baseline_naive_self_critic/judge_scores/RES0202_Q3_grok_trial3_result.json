  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies the key triad of symptoms (worsening dry cough, fever >100°F, loss of taste) matching Gold, with correct citations (P-1, P-2, P-5, P-12, P-17). Doctor's reasoning on fever differentiating infection from asthma (D-45) and COVID alignment (D-44) is faithfully represented, though quote paraphrased as 'compatible' vs. transcript's 'allowed' (likely 'aligned'). Minor addition of 'knowledge graph logic' introduces slight inaccuracy not in Gold or transcript, but core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers all Gold key points: triad symptoms with details and citations (cough worsening over 3 days, fever specifics, possible taste loss); D-44 COVID alignment; D-45 fever for infection vs. asthma. Includes acute progression and differentiation; systemic aspects (e.g., appetite via breakfast) implied. Misses explicit mention of fatigue but covers 90%+ effectively.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: symptoms and citations directly from transcript (P-1/2/5/12/17 for symptoms, D-44/45 for reasoning). Paraphrase of D-44 quote ('compatible' vs. 'allowed'/aligned) minor. Hallucination in 'knowledge graph logic' as doctor's method (not in transcript, fabricated reasoning), reducing grounding; otherwise mostly accurate citations and no other inventions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by specifying exact symptom combination (respiratory, temperature, taste) leading to COVID alignment and explaining collective use for infectious conclusion via fever differentiation, with no off-topic content."
