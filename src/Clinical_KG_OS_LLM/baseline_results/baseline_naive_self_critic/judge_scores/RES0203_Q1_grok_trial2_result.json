  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer states partial loss for both smell and taste with specific details (strong bad smells yes, very salty yes, banana/normal no); Generated correctly identifies partial smell but incorrectly states complete taste loss, contradicting Gold and transcript [P-4]; cough correctly mild dry but misses non-productive, no blood/sputum confirmation, consistency, onset, no triggers; misses duration (2 days) and consistency for sensory symptoms; significant factual errors on taste degree and omissions of key qualifiers.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 3 symptoms + 2-day duration; smell partial + strong bad odors; taste partial + salty yes/banana no; both consistent; cough mild dry + non-productive/no sputum/blood + consistent/no worsening + same onset + no triggers. Generated covers basic symptoms list, partial smell (no details), complete taste (wrong), mild dry cough (no details); covers ~20-30% (symptoms and partial cough/smell basics), misses specifics, duration, consistencies, etc. Score reflects 20-49%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims cite P-1 accurately for initial report; 'partial smell' and 'mild dry cough' verifiable; however, 'complete loss of taste' not verifiable—P-4 explicitly states partial ('can taste really salty foods' but not banana), initial P-1 'lost' clarified later; ignores P-4 details, leading to ungrounded degree for taste; no new fabrications but selective omission and misrepresentation; multiple issues with full grounding.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly lists sensory (smell/taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms with degrees and cites transcript; structured bullets perfectly match question's request for specifics, degrees (partial/complete), perceptions; no tangents or off-topic content."
