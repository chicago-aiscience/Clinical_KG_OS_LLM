{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It falsely claims that the transcript does not contain explicit verbal denials for symptoms like sore throat, cough, and loss of taste/smell, whereas the patient clearly denies these in responses P-4, P-7, and P-16. It also fails to mention the 'mostly clear' character of the nasal discharge, which is a key fact in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is incomplete. It misses the specific character of the discharge (clear) and fails to list any of the explicitly denied symptoms requested by the prompt (cough, sore throat, post-nasal drip, etc.), instead providing an incorrect meta-statement that they were not present in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the transcript lacks information regarding denied symptoms. The transcript explicitly shows the patient saying 'No' or 'Uh no' to several symptom checks (cough in P-4, post-nasal drip in P-6, sore throat/fever in P-7).",
    "relevance": "While the answer is structured to address the prompt's sections, the final section on denied symptoms is entirely irrelevant/incorrect because it claims the information is missing rather than extracting it."
