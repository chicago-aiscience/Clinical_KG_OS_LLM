  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that symptoms began about two days before presentation and that loss of smell, loss of taste, and dry cough occurred at the same time. However, it understates/obscures two transcript-supported points: (1) the clinician explicitly asked whether the cough started at the same time and the patient confirmed “Yes” [P-6], so simultaneity is more directly established than the Generated Answer suggests (“does not specify an order”); and (2) the patient explicitly denied prior similar episodes (“No, nothing like this”) [P-3], whereas the Generated Answer only says the patient “does not mention” prior symptoms, which is weaker than the transcript. No major contradictory factual errors are present.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: onset ~2 days prior; concurrent onset of smell/taste loss and dry cough; no worsening/fluctuation generally; cough described as mild/dry. Key points missed or only partially captured: explicit statements that symptoms were “pretty consistent” (smell/taste [P-5] and cough [P-8]) and not intermittent; the partial nature of smell/taste loss (can smell very strong/bad odors and taste very salty foods but not normal flavors like banana) [P-4]; explicit denial of prior similar symptoms [P-3]; and the contextual note that clinician considered pattern consistent with COVID symptoms [D-39] (optional but included in Gold). Overall coverage is moderate but not near-complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (2-day duration, concurrent symptoms, no worsening/fluctuation, mild dry cough). The main faithfulness issue is phrasing that implies uncertainty where the transcript is explicit (prior history and simultaneity of cough onset). These are not fabricated details, but they dilute transcript-backed certainty. No clear hallucinated symptoms or timelines.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question: relative onset timing of smell/taste/cough, whether symptoms fluctuated or worsened, and whether similar symptoms occurred previously. It does not add irrelevant content."
