  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the current medication regimen as multivitamins only [P-40], matching the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the penicillin allergy [P-37] and the specific rash reaction [P-38], consistent with the Gold. No factual errors or contradictions; minor capitalization difference ('Penicillin' vs 'penicillin') is negligible. The extra 'knowledge graph' reference is not a factual error about the patient but external.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: current regimen multivitamins only [P-40]; allergy to penicillin [P-37]; specific reaction rash [P-38]. Missed: pre-diabetic status and glucose monitoring with no Rx meds [P-33]; denial of high blood pressure [P-34]; denial of cholesterol issues [P-35]; no trouble breathing [P-39]; distinction of reaction type and clinical relevance note. Covers core direct answers to the question (about 60-70% of Gold's content).",
    "faithfulness": "All patient-specific claims ([P-40], [P-37], [P-38]) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The 'knowledge graph linking Penicillin to Rash' is not in the transcript, introducing a minor unverifiable external reference, but no fabricated patient facts or hallucinations about the case.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured perfectly around the three-part question (regimen, allergy, specific reaction) with bullet points, no off-topic content beyond a minor external note; directly and concisely addresses the query."
