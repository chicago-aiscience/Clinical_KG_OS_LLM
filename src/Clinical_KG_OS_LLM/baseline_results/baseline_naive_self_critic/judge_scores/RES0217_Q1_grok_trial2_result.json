  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies some local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness at the site behind left knee per P-1) matching Gold, but misses key details like 'stuck pretty good,' precise location in crease, soreness specifically of skin/not joint as local symptom, denial of bullseye rash (P-6), and statements of being totally fine/pretty healthy. For systemic, it covers joint pain (D-7/P-7) and fever/illness (D-8/P-8) correctly but falsely claims no headache screening (contradicting D-19/P-19-20 and Gold), and misattributes denials to P-1/P-3 instead of direct P-7/P-8/P-19. Significant contradictions on headaches and incomplete/misplaced local details warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key local points: location details (behind knee/crease), stuck pretty good (P-1), sore skin not joint (P-1), red/tender (P-1/P-6), no bullseye/larger rash (P-6), totally fine aside tenderness (P-18), pretty healthy (P-13). Generated covers redness/tenderness/soreness/location partially (~30-40%). Systemic Gold: joint pain denied (D-7/P-7), fever/ill (D-8/P-8), headaches denied (D-19/P-19-20). Generated covers joint/fever (~66%) but fully misses headaches and direct denials. Overall covers ~20-49% of key points, score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Local claims verifiable (red/tender/sore in P-1). Systemic screenings for joint/fever verifiable (D-7/D-8). However, hallucinates/misstates no headache screening (directly in D-19/P-19-20); misattributes denials to P-1/P-3 (P-3 is past tick, not current denial; actual in P-7/P-8/P-19); interprets 'not too bad' (P-3) as current denial (plausible but wrong context). Multiple misattributions and false claim on headaches, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response around local symptoms at site and systemic screenings/denials as asked, with citations; minor off-point note on headaches but overall focused on question, score 4."
