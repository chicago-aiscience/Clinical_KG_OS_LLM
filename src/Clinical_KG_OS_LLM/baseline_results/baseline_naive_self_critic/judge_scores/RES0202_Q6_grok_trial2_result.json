  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the assessment as COVID-compatible and infectious, test details, isolation, false negatives, alternative diagnosis, and exact warning signs. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., 'compatible' vs. 'consistent/aligned') do not introduce errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnostic test and turnaround (100%), isolation period including sister (100%), false negatives (100%), alternative diagnosis if negative (100%), warning signs with examples (100%), core assessment (100%). Missed: asthma differential note if no fever [D-45] and explicit mention of no medications/watchful waiting. Covers ~85-90% of Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [D-44, D-45]. No hallucinations; 'strict' isolation is a reasonable interpretation of the strong recommendation but grounded in context. Symptoms listed match patient's report.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around exact elements requested (test/time, isolation, alt diag/false neg, warning signs) plus assessment, with no off-topic content."
