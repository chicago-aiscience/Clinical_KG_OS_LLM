  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies core respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, cough) and sputum changes. However, it is factually incorrect regarding the patient's denials. It explicitly claims that the transcript lacks denials for orthopnea, PND, palpitations, and hemoptysis, which is false. The patient explicitly denied hemoptysis (P-7), orthopnea (P-9), PND (P-10), and palpitations (P-14).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several endorsed symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, specifically chest discomfort (P-13) and chills (P-29). It also fails to list any of the numerous pertinent negatives (e.g., calf pain, dizziness, nausea, fatigue) that the patient denied during the review of systems, covering less than 50% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a false claim about the source text by stating that denials were not recorded. This is a significant hallucination/misinterpretation of the transcript, as a large portion of the dialogue (D-7 through D-32) consists of the doctor screening symptoms and the patient denying them.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer follows the prompt's structure but fails to answer the specific question about which symptoms were denied, instead providing a factually incorrect explanation for why it could not answer that part of the query."
