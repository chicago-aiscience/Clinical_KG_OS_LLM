{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several factual errors. It states the symptoms may have 'worsened,' whereas the transcript (P-7) explicitly states they 'stayed the same.' Most importantly, it claims there is no clinical information regarding a runny nose, whereas the transcript contains direct dialogue about it (P-11, P-12, P-24).",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete as it misses the relative timing of the runny nose (which started 2-3 days after the cough) and fails to include the patient's specific comparison regarding the unique nature of this dry cough and the unusual duration of the runny nose compared to previous illnesses (P-24).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It explicitly hallucinates a lack of information ('no clinical information provided regarding a runny nose') when the transcript clearly discusses the runny nose's duration and appearance.",
    "relevance": "The answer only partially addresses the prompt. It fails to address the 'relative timing and duration of the dry cough versus the runny nose' because it incorrectly identifies that information as missing. It also misses the core of the comparison to prior experiences regarding these specific symptoms (dry cough and runny nose duration)."
