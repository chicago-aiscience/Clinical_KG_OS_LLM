  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the initial symptoms (headache and cough) starting four days ago, the loss of smell starting one day ago, and the presence of GI symptoms. It does not contain any false information.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific key points found in the gold answer and requested by the question. Specifically, it fails to mention that the diarrhea started two days ago and the vomiting occurred yesterday (lumping them as 'a few days back' from the initial symptom onset). Additionally, it does not explicitly state that the headache and cough remained 'stable in severity' or 'stayed around the same,' instead using the word 'persistent,' which does not fully address the severity change aspect of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript. The onset of headache/cough [P-1], loss of smell [P-24], and GI symptoms [P-1] are all accurately cited and grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for a timeline of the illness, although it lacks the granular detail provided in the gold answer regarding specific days and severity changes."
