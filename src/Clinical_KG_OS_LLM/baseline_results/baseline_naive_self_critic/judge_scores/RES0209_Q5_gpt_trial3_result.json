  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies the three triggers (exercise after gym/recess, cold air/winter, spring pollen) and links them to worsening asthma symptoms.\n- Correctly notes increased bronchodilator use as evidence of an exacerbation, but inaccurately states worsening over the “past week” rather than the “last two weeks” (P-13).\n- Misframes the role of family history as supporting “suspicion of asthma,” even though the patient already has an established asthma diagnosis since age 8 (P-2).\n- Introduces an unsupported idea that allergies might relate to “goldfish,” which is not stated or implied in the transcript and is clinically dubious in this context.\nOverall: core trigger-to-exacerbation relationship is mostly right, but there are notable inaccuracies and an implausible addition.",
    "completeness": "Gold answer key points vs Generated Answer:\n- Three triggers (exercise, cold/winter, spring/pollen): Covered.\n- Patient reported no other triggers when asked: Not covered.\n- Pollen trigger prompted clinician to ask about allergies; patient suspected but not formally diagnosed; clinician said it would make sense: Only partially covered (mentions “potential allergies” generally but omits the explicit clinician-prompted suspicion and the “not formally diagnosed / that would make sense” exchange).\n- Family history: sister with asthma; no other family breathing problems; no known family allergies: Sister asthma covered; the rest not covered.\n- Exacerbation context quantified: rescue inhaler increased from once every 2 weeks to 5–6 times/week: Not specifically covered (only vague “increased reliance”).\n- Clinician suggestion that medication change/controller therapy may be needed (rescue-only insufficient): Not covered.\nOverall coverage is partial (~50–70% of key points).",
    "faithfulness": "- Most trigger statements are grounded and correctly cited to P-9/P-11 and sister asthma to P-32.\n- However, the answer repeatedly references a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript.\n- It speculates about goldfish as a potential allergy trigger, which is not supported by the transcript and constitutes hallucinated/unsupported content.\n- Some minor temporal detail mismatch (week vs two weeks).\nOverall: some claims are grounded, but there are several non-transcript additions.",
    "relevance": "- Largely addresses how triggers and family history relate to the current asthma worsening and the idea of allergies.\n- Includes some minor tangential discussion (pets/goldfish, “knowledge graph”) that is not necessary to answer the question.\nOverall: mostly on-topic with small distractions."
