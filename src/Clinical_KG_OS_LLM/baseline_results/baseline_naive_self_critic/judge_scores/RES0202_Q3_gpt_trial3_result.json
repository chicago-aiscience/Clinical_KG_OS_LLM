  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key symptom combination highlighted in the Gold Answer: a worsening dry cough over ~3 days, fever just over 100°F (100.1–101°F), and possible loss of taste based on poor interest in breakfast. It also correctly reflects the doctor’s reasoning that fever shifts the differential toward infection rather than asthma, consistent with [D-45], and that the doctor explicitly aligned the symptoms with COVID-19 and ordered a swab/isolation in [D-44].\n\nA minor issue is the statement that the doctor used “knowledge graph logic” and explicitly used loss of taste as an indicator to justify testing/isolation; the transcript does not mention any such framework, and the doctor does not explicitly cite loss of taste in the COVID-alignment statement (though it was elicited earlier).",
    "completeness": "Covers essentially all key elements from the Gold Answer:\n- Dry cough worsening over several days ✔️\n- Fever >100°F (100.1–101°F) ✔️\n- Possible loss of taste ✔️\n- Doctor explicitly says symptoms align with COVID-19 and orders testing/isolation ✔️\n- Fever used as discriminator vs asthma; conclusion: most likely infection ✔️\n\nIt largely captures the collective use of findings to conclude an infectious process, though it does not explicitly add the Gold Answer’s extra contextual phrasing about systemic involvement (fatigue/decreased appetite) as part of the reasoning (it is implied but not emphasized).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript and appropriately referenced (dry cough, fever, taste change, COVID swab/isolation, fever distinguishing infection vs asthma).\n\nHowever, the phrase “knowledge graph logic” is not in the transcript and constitutes an invented rationale. Also, attributing explicit use of taste loss to the doctor’s justification in [D-44] is not clearly stated verbatim by the doctor (the doctor says symptoms align with COVID-19, but doesn’t list taste change there). These issues reduce grounding but do not dominate the answer.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked triad (respiratory complaint, temperature, taste change) and explains how the clinician used these together—especially fever as a discriminator—to conclude an infectious process/COVID-19 was most likely. No substantial tangents."
