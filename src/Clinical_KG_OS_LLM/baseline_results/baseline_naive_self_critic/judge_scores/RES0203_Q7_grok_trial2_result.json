  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states all three symptoms began simultaneously two days prior, with specific confirmation for cough [P-1,P-2,D-6,P-6]; sensory symptoms and cough both 'pretty consistent' without worsening or fluctuation [D-5,P-5,D-8,P-8]; partial sensory loss details [P-4]; no prior similar symptoms [D-3,P-3]. Generated Answer correctly identifies two-day onset and concurrent symptoms, no worsening/fluctuation, and no prior history as core conclusion, but has minor discrepancies: hedges on simultaneity (says no specified order despite P-6 confirmation), claims patient 'does not mention' prior symptoms citing only P-1 (ignores direct denial in P-3), omits partial loss persistence details. Core facts align, minor errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: simultaneous onset all three (incl. cough confirmation), consistent sensory (no fluct), consistent cough (no worsen), no intermittent/variable, partial sensory persisted, no prior history. Generated covers ~80-90%: two-day concurrent onset, no worsening/fluctuation, no prior; misses specific cough simultaneity confirmation, exact 'consistent' quotes/locations, partial nature details (strong odors/salty/banana), emphasis on non-intermittent.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: two-day onset [P-1,P-2], concurrent [P-1,P-6 implied], no worsening [inferred, confirmed P-5,P-8], mild cough [P-1], decline from baseline [P-1,P-4], no prior mention conclusion correct but phrasing 'does not mention [P-1]' inaccurate as P-3 directly denies. Citations accurate to P-1; no hallucinations or fabrications, minor over-reliance on P-1 vs. full transcript verifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around onset timing/relative beginnings, severity/fluctuation, and prior experience, perfectly matching question elements with no tangents or off-topic content."
