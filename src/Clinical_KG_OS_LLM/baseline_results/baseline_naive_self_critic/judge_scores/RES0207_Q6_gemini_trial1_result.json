  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims the transcript ends at [P-26], whereas the provided transcript continues until [D-38]. Consequently, it incorrectly states that it is impossible to answer the question, while the Gold Answer correctly identifies the specific next steps found in [D-37] and [D-38].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer because it erroneously refuses to provide an answer. It misses the involvement of the senior physician, the mention of potential tests, and the plan to return shortly.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the provided text. It claims the text ends abruptly, which is a hallucinated constraint. The information required to answer the question is clearly present in the later segments of the transcript (D-37).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is not relevant as it does not address the question asked. Instead of providing the 'next steps' requested, it provides a meta-commentary about its inability to find the information, based on a false premise."
