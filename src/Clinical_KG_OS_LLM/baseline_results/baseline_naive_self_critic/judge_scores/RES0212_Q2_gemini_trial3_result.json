  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the patient's use of moisturizing creams and previous prescriptions for eczema. However, it fails to mention the patient's explicit statement that she is not taking any medications [P-29], which is a core fact in the Gold Answer. It also misses the broader context of 'treatments' such as substance use and contraception mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer only covers approximately 25-30% of the key points in the Gold Answer. It focuses exclusively on eczema treatments while omitting: the general 'no medications' status, the denial of drug/food allergies, the use of condoms instead of hormonal birth control, the use of marijuana/vapes, alcohol consumption, and the lack of treatments for the current cough.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript [P-22, P-23]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant but narrow. It addresses the question of medications and treatments but arbitrarily restricts the scope to eczema, whereas the question and the Gold Answer encompass the patient's entire clinical status at the time of the visit."
