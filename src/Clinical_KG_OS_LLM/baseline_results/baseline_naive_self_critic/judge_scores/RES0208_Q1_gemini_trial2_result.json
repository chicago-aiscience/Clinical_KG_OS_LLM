  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer includes 'laborious' breathing and 'difficulty getting deep breaths' under Upper Respiratory Complaints; however, the prompt specifically asked for symptoms 'beyond his chief complaints of shortness of breath.' These descriptions are elaborations of the shortness of breath itself. Additionally, it misattributes the 'dry' sensation to the throat (P-8), whereas the transcript refers to the cough feeling dry. Other facts regarding taste, aches, fever, and appetite are correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points present in the Gold Answer: the diminished sense of smell (P-6), the presence of a mild cough (P-7), the specific mention of a sore throat (P-9), the denial of runny nose/congestion (P-10), general weakness (P-2), and mild headaches (P-11). It covers approximately 50% of the specific symptoms detailed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, though it slightly misinterprets P-8 (the dry sensation described for the cough is applied to the throat). The citations provided are generally accurate to the points made.",
    "relevance": "The answer follows the requested structure and addresses the categories of sensory changes, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, and constitutional symptoms. However, it fails to fully exclude the shortness of breath descriptions as requested by the prompt's 'beyond' clause."
