  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all the key facts from the Gold Answer. COVID-19 is correctly identified as the primary condition to rule out, the swab test is accurately described, the 24-48 hour turnaround time is correct, and the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness is properly stated. All facts align with the Gold Answer without errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: the primary condition (COVID-19), the diagnostic test (swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours), and alternative diagnosis (another viral illness). However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer such as the 14-day isolation instruction, public health contact tracing mention, and the supportive management approach. These are supplementary details that, while informative, don't directly answer the four-part question posed.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations to [D-52]. The answer quotes or closely paraphrases the doctor's actual statements without introducing hallucinated information. The citations are precise and the content is fully grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly focused on addressing the specific four-part question asked. It provides a clear, structured response with numbered points corresponding to each element of the question (condition to rule out, diagnostic test, turnaround time, and alternative diagnosis). There is no irrelevant content or tangential information."

All claims are properly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. While it omits some contextual details about isolation and management that appear in the Gold Answer, these details are supplementary to the core question being asked. The response is focused, factually correct, and directly addresses all four components of the question."
