  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on correctness. The question asks for symptoms and risks the patient *denied*. Instead, the Generated Answer lists symptoms the patient *affirmed* (fatigue, sleep disturbance, chest pain). Furthermore, it claims that the specific symptoms for P-5 and P-6 are 'not detailed' in the text, which is false; the transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about 'night sweats' (D-5) and 'unexplained weight loss' (D-6). It also incorrectly identifies 'cat exposure' as an exposure risk for TB in this context, whereas the transcript discusses cats in the context of allergies.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the denial of: night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis (blood in sputum), sick contacts (roommates, class, others), travel history, and IV drug use. It only correctly identifies Tuberculosis as a condition to exclude, but misses malignancy, endemic infections, and immunosuppression risks.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains hallucinations and groundedness errors. It claims the transcript is 'vague' and lacks detail for specific screenings that are explicitly stated (night sweats and weight loss). It also hallucinates a clinical connection between cat allergies and 'Feline/Zoonotic Tuberculosis' as the primary reason for the screening, which is not supported by the transcript or standard clinical reasoning in the Gold Answer.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it misinterprets the core of the question. By listing symptoms the patient has rather than those the patient denied, it fails to address the diagnostic purpose of screening for 'negative' constitutional symptoms in chronic cough cases."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally fails the task by listing symptoms the patient reported rather than those denied, while also hallucinating clinical reasoning regarding feline tuberculosis and claiming the transcript lacks details that are clearly present."
