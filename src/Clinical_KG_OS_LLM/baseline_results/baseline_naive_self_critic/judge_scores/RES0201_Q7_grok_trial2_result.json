  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the sore throat onset four days ago with some severity details, matching Gold. However, it inaccurately places muscle aches and reduced taste as 'current status' without their specific timelines (aches immediately after sore throat, taste two days ago per Gold and transcript P-26, P-20). It vaguely describes 'new symptom or worsening yesterday' as likely difficulty breathing but lacks details on its constant nature, worsening, and alarm (Gold/P-9,P-10). Misses progressive worsening of sore throat over four days, self-treatment failure, fatigue distinction, and overall trajectory. Significant discrepancies in chronology and symptom details contradict Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: sore throat onset and partial severity (day 1); vague breathing onset (day 4). Missed: fatigue/muscle aches timing and details (shortly after day 1); taste exact timing (day 3), constancy, novelty; sore throat full progression/worsening; breathing details (constant, worsening, new); self-treatment failure; overall progressive accumulation. Covers approximately 20-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in transcript: sore throat [P-2], concerned yesterday [P-8,P-19 for taste/smell, P-25 aches]. Inference of breathing as yesterday's symptom verifiable from context [P-7,P-8]. 'Likely refers to' is minor speculation but accurate. No fabrications; minor vagueness but verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Directly attempts chronological symptom order and severity changes starting from sore throat, with numbered timeline and symptom list. No off-topic content, though structure and details are incomplete/inaccurate."
