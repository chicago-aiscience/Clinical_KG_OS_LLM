  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains two significant factual errors. First, it states that the child developed symptoms after returning home on Thursday, whereas the transcript [P-1] specifies he came home Wednesday and the cough started that night. Second, it claims the transcript does not contain information about school notifications, but the mother explicitly states in [P-39], 'They haven't like contacted us about anything.'",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide the specific detail requested about school notification (claiming it is missing), whereas the Gold Answer correctly notes that the school had not contacted them. It also misses the context regarding the school's requirement for a COVID test to notify other families, which was part of the school's involvement in the suspected source/response.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness by claiming the source material does not contain information that is explicitly present (the school notification status). It also misinterprets the timeline of symptoms provided in [P-1].",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in that it attempts to address all parts of the multi-part question, although it provides incorrect or 'not found' responses for some sections."
