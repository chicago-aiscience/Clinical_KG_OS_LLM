  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies 'pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the context of an atopic predisposition'; Generated Answer states 'Asthma, specifically exercise-induced or allergic asthma,' which captures the core diagnosis accurately but lacks the precision of 'pediatric,' 'bronchoconstriction,' and 'atopic predisposition.' All factual claims about symptoms and triggers align with Gold Answer, with no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers 7 key points: (1) exercise-triggered [P-3,P-6,P-41], (2) episodic/reversible with rest [P-6,P-33], (3) cold weather [P-38], (4) multiple settings [P-38], (5) seasonal allergies [P-35,P-36], (6) nocturnal episode [P-43,P-44], (7) pertinent negatives [P-7,P-8,P-10,P-31]. Generated covers exercise [P-3], cold weather [P-38], allergies [P-35,P-36], and general symptoms [P-1,P-2], missing reversibility, multiple settings, nocturnal symptoms, recurring pattern details, and negatives; covers ~50-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited transcript excerpts [P-1,P-2,P-3,P-35,P-36,P-38] accurately match the source transcript content. Minor unverifiable addition of 'symptoms directly linked in the Knowledge Graph' (no such graph in transcript), but no other hallucinations; claims are grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly names the diagnosis (asthma) and provides transcript-supported evidence addressing triggers, weather, allergies, and symptoms, perfectly matching the question's request for diagnosis and supporting findings without off-topic content."
