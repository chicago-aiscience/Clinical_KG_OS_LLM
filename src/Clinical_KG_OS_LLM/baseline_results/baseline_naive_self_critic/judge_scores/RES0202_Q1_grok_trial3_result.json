  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies some mother-reported symptoms like dry cough worsening [P-1], runny nose [P-16], fever over 100 [P-1], fatigue [P-1,P-8], possible loss of taste [P-17], but inaccurately attributes loss of appetite primarily to [P-17] (Gold cites [P-15]), misses cough progression details [P-5,P-12], fever specifics [P-2], decreased appetite explicitly [P-15], and uncertain shortness of breath [P-8]. Critically, it falsely claims none of the example symptoms (wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, GI) were explicitly asked about and denied, contradicting the transcript (e.g., wheezing [D-7/P-7], chest pain [D-13/P-13], sore throat [D-14/P-14], chills [D-19/P-19], GI [D-22/P-22, D-23/P-23]) and Gold Answer's detailed list of pertinent negatives. Significant contradictions on core denied symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: dry cough (partial), worsening (partial), fever (partial), fatigue, runny nose, possible taste loss, appetite (partial). Missed: full cough timeline/progression [P-12], exact fever values [P-2], explicit decreased appetite [P-15], uncertain SOB [P-8]. Entirely misses all denied symptoms list (sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, rashes, GI issues, etc.) and notes on swallowing uncertainty, vision/hearing. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded with accurate citations (e.g., cough [P-1], runny nose [P-16], fever [P-1], fatigue [P-1,P-8], taste [P-17]), but loss of appetite wrongly tied mainly to [P-17] (primarily taste; appetite in [P-15]). Major hallucination: 'None of the specific symptoms... explicitly asked about by the doctor' directly contradicts transcript (multiple explicit asks/denials). Misrepresents later D-44 questions as 'doctor-asked and denied' (not contemporaneous denials by mother). Multiple unverifiable/false claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported respiratory/systemic symptoms and doctor-asked/denied symptoms, matching question's two parts; minor irrelevant additions like 'knowledge graph' and later neurological mentions, but no major tangents."
