  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer/transcript, the Generated Answer correctly identifies: (1) sharp/strong pain quality, (2) pleuritic component—worse with deep breath, and (3) ~20-minute episode duration. However, it contains a major factual error about when the pain occurs/resolves: it states the chest pain is felt “only during episodes of anxiety attacks” ([P-20]), but [P-20] refers to palpitations/heart flutter during anxiety attacks, not chest pain. The transcript instead indicates pain is noticed when alone (walking to school, studying) and tends to go away or be unnoticed when engaged/socially distracted at school. This is a significant contradiction of the key situational characteristic asked in the question and described in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: sharp/strong quality; deep-breath association; ~20-minute episodes. Key points missed (or replaced with incorrect info): initial description as discomfort/odd; duration of symptoms ~1.5 weeks; intermittent “here and there” nature across the day; occurs at rest (studying/sitting); tends to occur when alone (walking/studying) and resolve/go unnoticed when talking to others/doing tasks/at school; not worse with exercise. The answer also adds treatment response and stress/family history, which are not part of the question’s requested characteristics. Overall, it captures less than half of the requested situational/temporal detail and gets the occurrence/resolution context wrong.",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are grounded in the transcript (sharp/strong; deep breath; 20 minutes; OTC meds not helping; stress/family history). But the central claim about occurrence/resolution—pain only during anxiety attacks—is not supported and directly contradicts the transcript’s description of when pain is noticed vs not noticed. This constitutes a significant unfaithful inference/misattribution.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at describing quality and duration, which are relevant. However, it fails the most important part of the question (situations in which pain occurs vs resolves) by providing an incorrect scenario, and it includes some extraneous context (stress/family history, treatment response) not asked for. Therefore it is only partially relevant to the specific question."
