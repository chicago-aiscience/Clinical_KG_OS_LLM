  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify which symptom appeared first, when [P-4] explicitly states the scratchy throat came first, followed by coughing. It also incorrectly claims there is 'no available evidence' about feeling hot, when multiple exchanges ([P-7], [P-9], [D-7], [D-8]) clearly document this symptom. These are major contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses critical information present in the Gold Answer: the explicit sequence (scratchy throat first, then cough per [P-4]), the headache symptoms, the malaise/feeling crappy, the fatigue, the detailed description of persistent heat sensation day and night ([P-9]), and the doctor's summary mentioning 'a little bit of fever' ([D-58]). It covers less than 20% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains hallucinations by claiming certain information is absent from the transcript when it is clearly present. Specifically, it falsely states the transcript 'does not contain any mention of the patient feeling hot' when [P-7], [P-8], and [P-9] explicitly discuss this. This is a significant fabrication that contradicts verifiable transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question about symptom order and the relationship of feeling hot to other symptoms, but provides an evasive non-answer by claiming information is unavailable when it actually exists in the transcript. This makes it largely unhelpful despite nominally addressing the question's topics."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely deficient across all dimensions. It contains major factual errors by claiming the transcript does not specify symptom order when [P-4] explicitly states scratchy throat came first, followed by cough. Most critically, it falsely claims there is 'no available evidence' about feeling hot, directly contradicting multiple exchanges ([P-7], [P-9]) that clearly document this symptom. The answer misses the headache, malaise, fatigue, and detailed heat descriptions present in the Gold Answer. It demonstrates significant hallucination by denying the existence of clearly documented information, making it unreliable and incomplete."
