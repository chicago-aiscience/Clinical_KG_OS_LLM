  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptom combination driving suspicion (loss of smell, loss of taste, mild dry cough) and accurately states that the doctor explicitly linked these to COVID-19 in D-39 and ordered a swab test in D-39. No statements contradict the Gold Answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core elements from the Gold Answer: (1) the triad of symptoms (anosmia, ageusia, dry cough), (2) the doctor’s explicit rationale that symptoms are consistent with COVID-19, and (3) the chosen test method (swab). Missing several additional Gold Answer points: patient initially raised COVID concern (P-1), the doctor’s systematic confirmation of absent symptoms (e.g., fever, dyspnea, sore throat, chest pain), the summary that the patient was otherwise well (D-16/P-16), and the self-isolation instruction while awaiting results (D-39).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made are directly supported by the transcript and the cited turns (P-1 and D-39). No evident hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question about which symptom combination prompted suspicion and how the doctor connected symptoms to COVID-19 and the swab test. No meaningful irrelevant content."
