  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the diagnosis (COVID-19), the occupational context (hospital clerk), the symptom profile (persistent cough following flu-like symptoms), and the negative test result. It is fully consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer, including the diagnosis, the patient's role as a hospital clerk, the persistent cough, the flu-like symptoms, and the negative result.

    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript and correctly cited (e.g., P-2, P-14, P-34, P-35). There is no hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing all three parts of the prompt (diagnosis, evidence, and results) without including unnecessary information."
