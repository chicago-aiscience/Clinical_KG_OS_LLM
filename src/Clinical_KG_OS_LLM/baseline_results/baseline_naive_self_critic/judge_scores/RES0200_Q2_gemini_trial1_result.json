  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript but lacks precision. It describes Ventolin use as 'a lot more' rather than providing the specific frequency ('10 times') requested by the prompt. It correctly identifies the medications and the fact that the blood pressure medication was discontinued without approval.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer: the specific count of Ventolin use (10 times in the past week), the specific type of blood pressure medication (diuretic), the patient's rationale for stopping it (BP was well controlled), and the doctor's recommendation for follow-up.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It uses direct quotes and correct speaker tags for the information it does provide, without any hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the user's question, though the response to the 'how frequently' sub-question is vague compared to the specific data available in the source text."
