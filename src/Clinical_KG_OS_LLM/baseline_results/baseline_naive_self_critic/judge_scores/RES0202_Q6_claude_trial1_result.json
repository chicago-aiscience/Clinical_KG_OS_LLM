  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts presented in the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, the 14-day isolation recommendation including separation from the sister, the possibility of false negatives, the alternative diagnosis of 'another viral illness,' and all five warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms/seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells). The citation references are accurate.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major elements from the Gold Answer: diagnostic test with timeline, isolation period, false negative acknowledgment, alternative diagnosis, and warning signs with examples. However, it omits two minor details: (1) the doctor's note in D-45 about how the presence of fever distinguished this from asthma-like presentations, and (2) the explicit mention of 'watchful waiting with clear return precautions' as the overall approach. These omissions are relatively minor compared to the comprehensive coverage of all key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer stays grounded in what the doctor explicitly stated in D-44 and D-45. There are no hallucinated facts or unsupported extrapolations. The citations [D-44] and [D-45] are correctly applied throughout.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the multi-part question: diagnostic test and turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negative possibility, and warning signs with examples. The answer is well-organized and focused, with no irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent response that is factually accurate, well-grounded in the transcript, and directly addresses all major components of the question. It correctly identifies the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation including from sister, false negative possibility, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and all five warning signs. Minor deductions in completeness for omitting the asthma differential context from D-45 and the characterization of the approach as 'watchful waiting,' but these are relatively minor gaps in an otherwise comprehensive answer."
