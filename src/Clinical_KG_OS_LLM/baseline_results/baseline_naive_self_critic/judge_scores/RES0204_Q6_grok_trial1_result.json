  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), consultation with the supervising physician, and follow-up steps, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancies include omitting the physical exam of lungs and heart mentioned in [D-1], slightly misattributing the X-ray explanation citation to [D-39] (actually [D-38]), and not noting the tentative 'might' for the X-ray or explicit trainee status. However, no major errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic tests (chest X-ray [D-37], COVID swab [D-39]), explanations, consultation [D-1, D-37], follow-up return and discussion [D-1, D-40]. Missed or partially covered: explicit physical exam (lungs/heart auscultation [D-1]), 'arrange for these things' phrasing [D-40], return specifically 'with the supervising physician', patient/mother agreement [P-40], and concluding thanks [D-41, D-42]. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: tests and explanations [D-37-D-39], consultation [D-1, D-37], follow-up [D-1, D-40], reassurances [D-37, D-39]. Minor citation inaccuracy (X-ray explanation primarily [D-38], not [D-39]), but no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured around the question's requirements (diagnostic tests, consultation, follow-up steps), using clear sections with transcript citations, with no off-topic content."
