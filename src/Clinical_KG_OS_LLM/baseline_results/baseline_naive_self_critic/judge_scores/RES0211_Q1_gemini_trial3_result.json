  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. Most notably, it claims that the transcript does not contain explicit denials for sputum production, nausea, joint pain, or rashes. However, the transcript clearly shows the patient denying these in turns P-6 (phlegm/sputum), P-10 (rashes), P-11 (nausea), and P-13 (joint aches). It also misses the patient's report of feeling 'really hot' or having a fever, which is a core part of the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers only about 33% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the cough, throat issues, headache, and malaise. However, it misses the reported symptoms of fever/feeling hot and tiredness. It also misses nearly all denied symptoms (diarrhea, breathing issues) and incorrectly states that the specific examples requested in the prompt (sputum, nausea, etc.) are missing from the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails on faithfulness by making a false claim about the source text. It states that the transcript does not contain explicit mentions of certain denials, which is a 'hallucination of absence.' These denials are explicitly present in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it attempts to follow the structure of the prompt (Reported vs. Denied). However, because it fails to find the information requested in the 'denied' section despite it being present, the utility of the response is low. It captures the basic reported symptoms but fails the specific constraints of the question regarding denied symptoms mentioned in the examples (sputum, nausea, etc.)."
