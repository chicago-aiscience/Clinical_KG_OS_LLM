  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the core plan in the Gold Answer: chest exam, chest X-ray, COVID swab, self-isolation including avoiding wife, results in 24–48 hours, and public health nurse guidance if positive. The only minor discrepancy is in the admission/discharge criteria: the transcript/Gold Answer frames disposition as based on “those results” (i.e., test results) without explicitly adding physical exam findings as a stated criterion. Adding exam findings is a reasonable clinical inference, but it is not explicitly stated as part of the decision criteria in D-37.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) planned chest-focused physical exam, (2) diagnostic tests: chest X-ray and COVID swab, (3) self-isolation if discharged: stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate as much as possible, (4) results timeline 24–48 hours, (5) public health nurse to advise if positive, (6) disposition dependent on results, no numeric thresholds. The Generated Answer includes all of these; the only slight variation is expanding disposition criteria to include physical exam findings.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by D-37/D-38. The claim that admission vs discharge will be based on chest X-ray, COVID swab, and physical exam findings is partially inferred: the transcript explicitly ties the decision to “those results” after ordering tests, while the exam is mentioned as part of assessment but not explicitly listed as a disposition criterion. No other hallucinated tests/instructions are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is tightly focused on the requested components (tests ordered, physical exam, isolation instructions and from whom, timeline, and admission vs discharge criteria) with no meaningful irrelevant content."
