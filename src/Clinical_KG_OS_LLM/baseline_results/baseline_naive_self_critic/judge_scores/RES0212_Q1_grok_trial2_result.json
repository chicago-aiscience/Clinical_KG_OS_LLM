  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: cough duration incorrectly stated as 'approximately one month [P-1]' (Gold and transcript [P-2] indicate three months chronic with recent worsening); misses key details like initial dry/intermittent nature, onset during pole dancing [P-13], productive only past three days [P-12], sputum no blood [P-10]/no foul smell [P-11], subjective fevers [P-4], exercise impairment [P-47]; chest pain described as occurring with cough but Gold specifies discomfort only when coughing not at rest; denials only vaguely lists two ([P-5] night sweats, [P-6] weight loss) without naming them or including others like hemoptysis, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, body pain, sick contacts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered partially: cough (incomplete/wrong duration), chest discomfort with cough, greenish gross sputum (misses no blood/smell/3-day duration), fatigue/sleep disturbance from cough waking her nightly last month; misses full cough history (3 months dry intermittent recurrent, pole dancing onset), fevers, exercise impact; denials cover only ~10% (2 out of many: night sweats, weight loss vaguely, misses hemoptysis, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, pain, sick contacts). Covers 20-49%.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable in transcript (e.g., greenish sputum [P-9], hurts when cough [P-3], tired/sleep [P-19], denials [P-5,P-6]); however, cough duration 'one month [P-1]' is inaccurate hallucination (P-1 has no duration, P-2 says 3 months); references non-existent 'knowledge graph'; infers 'cough causes chest pain' plausible but not directly stated; multiple interpretive errors and extraneous KG mention indicate hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported respiratory/associated symptoms (cough, chest pain, sputum, fatigue, sleep) and denied symptoms with transcript citations, closely matching question focus on symptoms, cough/sputum characteristics, and explicit denials; minor tangent with unmentioned knowledge graph."
