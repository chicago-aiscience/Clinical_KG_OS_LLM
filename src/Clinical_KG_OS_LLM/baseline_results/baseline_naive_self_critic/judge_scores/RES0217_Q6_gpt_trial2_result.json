  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all major elements: quick physical exam, sending the tick for species ID, ordering blood work for Lyme titres/serology, recommending prophylactic antibiotics due to presumed >72-hour attachment and geographic risk, planning to speak with/consult the physician, and giving environmental prevention advice (long grass/edge of woods-fields, “waving” motion, consider insecticide). A minor inaccuracy/over-interpretation is stating the physician consultation is “likely a colleague or specialist” and that the discussion is to “review the results,” which is not explicitly stated (the transcript only says they will talk to the doctor and the physician will also see the patient). Overall, core facts are correct with only minor speculative phrasing.",
    "completeness": "Covers essentially all key Gold Answer points: (1) quick physical exam, (2) tick sent to lab for identification, (3) blood work for titres/serology, (4) prophylactic antibiotics without specifying agent/dose, (5) plan to talk to the doctor/physician to see patient, and (6) preventive advice about tick habitat and using insecticide. No meaningful omissions relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript and align with cited turns. Minor extrapolations include interpreting the consulted doctor as “likely a colleague or specialist” and adding “to review the results,” which are plausible but not explicitly said. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing diagnostic tests (physical + lab), treatment, physician consultation, and preventive outdoor/garden advice. No significant tangents."
