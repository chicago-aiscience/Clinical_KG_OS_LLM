  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer emphasizes specific symptoms like scratchy throat [P-4], dry cough [P-1,P-4], subjective fever from feeling hot [P-7,P-9], headache [P-1,P-2], malaise [P-14,D-15], fatigue [P-13], 3-4 day timeline [P-1,P-3], no sputum/phlegm [P-5,P-6], no GI [P-11,P-12], no joint pain [P-13], brother's cold [P-39], and doctor's summary [D-58]. Generated covers scratchy throat, dry cough, headache, malaise/'crappy', fatigue/tired, absences of sputum (inferred), GI, joint pain accurately. However, it uses 'tired' as proxy for subjective fever without citing feeling hot [P-7,P-9], misses timeline, brother's exposure, and doctor's summary; adds allergy exclusion (valid but not core). Minor discrepancies, core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: scratchy throat, dry cough, headache, malaise (crappy), fatigue (tired), no sputum (dry cough), no GI, no joint pain (~80%). Missed: explicit subjective fever details [P-7,P-9], 3-4 day timeline, brother's cold [P-39], doctor's summary [D-58], malaise characterization [D-15]. Covers majority of symptom constellation and absences central to question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: symptoms [P-1,P-13], allergies/timing [P-16], absences later in transcript [P-11-13]. Citations accurate (e.g., [P-1] for throat/cough/headache). 'Dry' implies no sputum (confirmed [P-5,P-6]). 'Tired as proxy for subjective fever' interpretive but plausible (feeling hot explicit elsewhere); no fabrications, minor stretch on proxy.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures reasoning around how listed symptoms (throat, cough, headache) and absences (sputum, GI, joint) support URI via upper airway localization, viral systemic signs, exclusion of alternatives; perfectly focused on question without tangents."
