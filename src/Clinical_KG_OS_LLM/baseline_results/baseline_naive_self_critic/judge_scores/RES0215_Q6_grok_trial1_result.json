  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor's plan is 'not included' in the transcript, directly contradicting [D-58] where the doctor explicitly outlines the plan (physical exam, consult physician, discuss next steps), which matches the Gold Answer. It also misattributes environmental factors (e.g., 'patient reported' instead of mother; includes 'colder weather' from [P-38] which is not home-specific) and omits key home factors like smoking, pets, fireplaces, and air filters. Major factual errors and contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: doctor's plan (3 steps: physical exam, consult physician, return/discuss; offer questions; no specific tests); home env factors (smoking no [P-53], new carpets [P-54], pets no [P-55], fireplaces no [P-56], air filters yes [P-57], townhouse [P-50], family context [P-49]). Generated covers only townhouse [P-50] and carpets [P-54] (~2/10+ points), misses entire plan and most env factors. Covers <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absence of doctor's plan despite clear statement in [D-58]; citations for env ([P-38], [P-50], [P-54]) are accurate but incomplete and include non-home factor (colder weather). 'Patient' vs. mother is minor error, but denying plan's existence is major fabrication not grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Partially addresses env factors but ignores/denies the primary question element (doctor's plan), focusing instead on incorrect conclusion of no plan; includes irrelevant 'colder weather' and partial env list, making it largely off-topic for full question."
