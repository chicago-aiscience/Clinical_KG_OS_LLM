{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the content of the transcript. It claims the 'doctor's explicit summary is not included in the text,' whereas turn [D-58] is an explicit summary starting with 'So just to summarize...' This fundamental error causes the answer to miss the specific findings recapped (fever, lack of sputum, brother's illness, lack of asthma).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the lack of sputum production, the specific mention of the brother's cold, the exclusion of asthma, and the specific goal of wanting to know 'if I have to take medicine' or the desire to 'go home soon and lay down.' It only captures the dry cough and headache mentioned elsewhere in the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails faithfulness by hallucinating that the summary is missing from the provided text. It ignores the actual summary present in turn [D-58].",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it identifies some symptoms Jessica has, it fails to answer the question from the perspective of the doctor's summary as specifically requested, instead drawing information from the initial intake portion of the transcript."
