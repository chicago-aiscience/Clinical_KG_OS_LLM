  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies the cause as psychological, specifically naming 'Conversion Disorder'. However, the Gold Answer and clinical standards suggest 'anxiety-related' or 'stress-induced chest pain'. Conversion disorder typically involves neurological deficits (motor/sensory) rather than visceral pain like chest pain, which is better categorized as Somatic Symptom Disorder or anxiety. Therefore, the diagnosis provided is less accurate than the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers about 50% of the key points. It correctly identifies the history of anxiety, current academic stress, and the situational pattern (social vs. alone). However, it misses several critical points from the Gold Answer: the patient's specific breathing pattern during episodes (breathing faster due to nervousness), the patient's own suspicion that it might be stress, and the extensive list of pertinent negatives (lack of fever, lack of exertional worsening, no asthma) which are vital for ruling out organic causes.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations regarding the source material. It twice references a 'knowledge graph' ('The knowledge graph explicitly links...', 'The knowledge graph further links...') which does not exist in the provided transcript or prompt. It also introduces external psychodynamic theories ('displaced expression of conflict') not present in the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in that it directly addresses the question asked, attempting to provide a diagnosis and supporting clinical observations based on the patient's history and symptoms."
