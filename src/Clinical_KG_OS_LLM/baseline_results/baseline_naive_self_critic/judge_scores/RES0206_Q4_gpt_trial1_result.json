  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition the doctor wanted to rule out (explicitly stated at D-43), correctly names the ordered test as a COVID swab (D-43), and accurately attributes the prompting social-contact detail to the patient walking outdoors with friends including one who was sick and that they sometimes walked too close (P-20). No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) COVID swab ordered, (3) exposure history—walking dogs with friends, one friend sick, sometimes too close despite being outdoors. Key Gold Answer points missed: (a) patient was unsure whether the friend had a COVID test (D-21/P-21), and (b) additional COVID screening/travel screening mentioned in the Gold Answer (P-31 to P-35). While not strictly required by the question, they are part of the Gold Answer’s supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript citations provided (D-43, P-20). The only minor issue is an extraneous phrase about a “knowledge graph,” which is not in the transcript but does not add a new clinical fact. Overall, no meaningful hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what was asked: the condition to rule out, the test ordered, and the social-contact detail that prompted consideration. No notable irrelevant content."
