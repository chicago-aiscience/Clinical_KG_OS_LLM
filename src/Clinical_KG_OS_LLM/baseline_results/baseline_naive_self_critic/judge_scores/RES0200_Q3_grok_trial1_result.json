  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (worsening cough [P-1], increased dyspnea [P-1, P-8], sputum changes [P-6]) and links them to the patient's COPD history via the doctor's exact statement in [D-52], matching the Gold Answer's core facts without errors, though it omits minor details like exact COPD duration (5 years [P-2]) and specific inhalers (Ventolin, Spiriva [P-11]).",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: three cardinal symptoms (worsening cough, sputum changes from clear-white to yellow, increased dyspnea with minimal exertion details), COPD history context, and doctor's synthesis in [D-52] quoting worsening cough/SOB on COPD background; missed: precise cough triggers (stairs [P-5]), SOB recovery need (sit down [P-8]), COPD 5-year duration [P-2], inhaler names [P-11], and 'acute-on-chronic' reframing phrasing.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-1, P-6, P-8, D-52 quote exact); no hallucinations or unverifiable details; sputum change and worsening explicitly patient-reported, doctor's link grounded in D-52.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by specifying the exact symptom combination (worsening cough, sputum changes, increased dyspnea) with COPD history and detailing the doctor's linkage via direct quote from assessment, with no off-topic content."
