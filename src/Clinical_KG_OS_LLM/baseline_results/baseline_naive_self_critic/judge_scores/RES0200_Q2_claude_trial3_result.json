  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error in reporting Ventolin frequency. The transcript clearly states 'almost like 10 times this past week' [P-12] in response to D-12's direct question about weekly usage, but the Generated Answer only vaguely states 'a lot more recently' which misses the specific quantification. The medication list is accurate (Ventolin/Ventilin, Spiriva, atorvastatin, and discontinued diuretic), though the spelling 'Ventilin' vs 'Ventolin' varies. The discontinuation of blood pressure medication is correctly identified.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers most key points but missing critical details: (1) specific Ventolin frequency of 10 times per week, (2) the type of blood pressure medication (diuretic), (3) the patient's rationale for stopping (blood pressure well controlled), and (4) the patient's explicit admission 'I just stopped taking it. I didn't really like ask the doctor' [P-36]. The Gold Answer provides fuller context including doctor's response about kidney complications.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript. The medications listed (Spiriva, Torva Staten, blood pressure medication) are directly referenced. However, the vague characterization of Ventolin frequency as 'a lot more recently' is less faithful to the specific number '10 times this past week' stated in [P-12]. All claims are verifiable but lack precision in one key area.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three components of the question: (1) medications prior to visit including respiratory and non-respiratory, (2) Ventolin frequency, and (3) self-discontinued medication. The structure mirrors the question format. No irrelevant content is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key medications and the self-discontinued blood pressure medication, fully addressing the question's structure. However, it lacks critical details present in the Gold Answer: the specific Ventolin frequency (10 times vs 'a lot more'), the medication type (diuretic), the patient's rationale for stopping, and the explicit quote about not consulting the doctor. These omissions reduce both correctness and completeness despite the answer being largely faithful to the transcript and highly relevant to the question."
