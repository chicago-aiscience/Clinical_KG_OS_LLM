  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the core findings in the Gold Answer. It accurately identifies the missed dose of Keppra as the cause and cites the correct passage (P-9) where the patient acknowledges the link.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is less comprehensive than the Gold Answer. It misses several key points: the specific context of why the dose was missed (daughter's birthday/disrupted dinner routine from P-24), the fact that the patient's admission was unprompted by specific medication questions (D-9 context), and the detail that the patient's seizures are usually infrequent, which reinforces the causal link.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript regarding clinical facts. However, it references a 'knowledge graph and clinical notes' which were not part of the provided source material, indicating a minor hallucination regarding the source context.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses both parts of the question (the connection and the evidence of patient recognition) without unnecessary tangents."
