{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID (matching Gold's COVID-19) as the alternative diagnosis due to symptom overlap with COPD exacerbation, specifies the COVID swab as the test, and states the 24-48 hour turnaround time, all consistent with the Gold Answer and directly supported by [D-52]. Minor stylistic differences like capitalization ('Covid' vs 'COVID-19') do not affect factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: alternative diagnosis (COVID/Covid), reason (symptom overlap with COPD exacerbation), test (COVID swab/covid swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours), and citations ([D-52]). Elaborative details in Gold (e.g., specific patient symptoms, note on unspecified overlapping symptoms) are not core to the question but not required for completeness here; 100% coverage of essentials.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript: symptom overlap with Covid, ordering covid swab to rule it out, and results in 24-48 hours. Citations are precise and accurate; no hallucinated information.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer precisely addresses all three parts of the question (alternative diagnosis, specific test, expected turnaround time) without any off-topic content, maintaining perfect focus."
