{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns well with the transcript. It correctly identifies the diagnostic tests (physical exam, blood work, tick ID), the treatment (prophylactic antibiotics based on the 72-hour window), the plan to consult a superior/colleague, and the preventive environmental advice (habitat, behavior, and insecticide).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific mention of the geographic risk factor (Strathroy) as a rationale for the antibiotics, which was included in the Gold Answer. It also lacks the detail that the consultation likely indicates a trainee-supervised encounter, though it does mention the consultation itself.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. Every claim made, including the 'waving motion' of ticks and the '72+ hours' timeframe, is directly supported by the provided text (specifically D-6, D-13, and D-18).",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, structured to directly address each specific part of the multi-faceted question (tests, treatments, consultation, and preventive advice)."
