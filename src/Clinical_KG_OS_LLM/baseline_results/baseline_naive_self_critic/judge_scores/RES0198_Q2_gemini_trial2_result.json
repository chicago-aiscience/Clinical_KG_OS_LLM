  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the key findings in both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the previous medication (decongestants), the patient's evaluation ('worked a little bit'), and the doctor's suggestion (Tylenol Cold).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is slightly less comprehensive than the gold answer. It misses the doctor's recommendation to stay 'well hydrated' and the patient's reasoning for the 'little bit' of effectiveness (the transition from stuffy to runny). It also omits the secondary details about the expected duration of the illness mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the generated answer are directly supported by the provided transcript and include correct speaker/turn citations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the three specific parts of the user's question without unnecessary filler."
