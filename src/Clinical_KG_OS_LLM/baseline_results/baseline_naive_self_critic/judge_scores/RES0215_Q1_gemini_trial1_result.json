  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty taking deep breaths) and correctly notes that the cough appeared later. However, it identifies only 'wheezy' as the earliest symptom, whereas the transcript [P-2] and Gold Answer specify both 'wheezy' and 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' as the symptoms noticed first.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer captures the primary list of symptoms but omits several descriptive details provided in the Gold Answer, such as the activity context (playing tag), the absence of cyanosis (not turning blue), the non-productive nature of the cough (no phlegm), and the child's overall healthy appearance. It also misses one of the two symptoms identified as appearing first.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It uses accurate citations [P-1] and [P-2] to support its claims and does not introduce any information not found in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both components of the user's question (the list of symptoms at presentation and the earliest symptoms)."
