  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states onset was ~4–5 days ago and that physical activity (playing tag) precipitated symptoms, and notes later emergence of a slight cough. However, it contains major inaccuracies: it misattributes the activity trigger citation to [P-1] (the tag trigger is in [P-3]); it incorrectly suggests the current fluctuating pattern is “consistent with” prior viral infections over the past two years—this is not stated and conflates unrelated history ([P-15] is past infections, not current symptom pattern); and it wrongly claims the transcript contains no nocturnal episode, contradicting [P-43–P-44], which clearly describe one nighttime wheeze episode that resolved. These errors materially conflict with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: timing (4–5 days), exertional trigger (playing tag), fluctuating/episodic nature (mentioned but not well described), and emergence of slight cough. Key points missed or inadequately covered: the explicit pattern of episodes recurring with activity and resolving with rest ([P-6]); the nocturnal episode details (single nighttime wheeze episode, resolved, trouble falling asleep [P-43–P-44]); cough being non-productive/no phlegm ([P-31]); and pertinent negatives (no fever, no cyanosis, well between attacks). Overall, it captures roughly half to two-thirds of the required elements and misses a major required component (nocturnal episode).",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not grounded or are contradicted by the transcript: referencing a “knowledge graph” not provided in the source; inferring that symptom fluctuation relates to prior viral infections (not supported); and explicitly stating there is no nocturnal episode despite transcript evidence. Citations are also inaccurate (tag trigger cited as [P-1]). These issues represent several hallucinations/unverifiable additions and one direct contradiction.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on symptom development (onset, triggers, pattern, cough). Some content is tangential (linking pattern to prior viral infections; knowledge-graph references; allergy associations) and the incorrect dismissal of nocturnal symptoms undermines the central question, but it remains generally on-topic."
