  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies fever and sore throat as key symptoms from [D-53], matching Gold, but introduces factual errors like incorrect citation [P-27] for flu shot response (actual [P-53]), minor phrasing 'stuffy throat', and misses Gold's emphasis on broader symptoms [D-24] and husband's symptoms; core facts align but discrepancies exist.",
    "completeness": "Covers fever/sore throat [D-53] and flu vaccination history [D-53/P-53/D-54]; misses Gold's key points on broader symptom cluster 'muscle aches, little bit of fever, stuffy nose, sore throat' [D-24] and epidemiological context of husband's similar symptoms [D-53], covering ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded (e.g., [D-53], [D-54]), but hallucinates 'knowledge graph' (absent from transcript), wrong citation [P-27] (refers to neck swelling, not flu shot), and unverifiable COVID-specific indicators beyond transcript; multiple inaccuracies.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question with structured sections on symptoms for infectious etiology/COVID-19 and vaccination history for influenza, no off-topic content."
