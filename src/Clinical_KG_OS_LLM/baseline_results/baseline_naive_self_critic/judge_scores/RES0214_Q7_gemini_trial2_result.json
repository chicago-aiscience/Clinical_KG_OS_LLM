  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the stuffy nose as the first symptom, followed by the fever (3 days) and sore throat. It also correctly notes the presence of muscle aches. The comparison with the husband's timeline (1 week) is accurate based on the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few nuances from the gold answer. Specifically, it does not explicitly state that the muscle aches were concurrent with the fever (it says they were 'subsequently mentioned,' which refers more to the conversation flow than the illness timeline). It also fails to provide the specific calculation that the husband's illness began ~4 days before the patient's, and it misses the clinical interpretation regarding household transmission mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All symptom durations (3-day fever) and the husband's timeline (1 week) are directly supported by the text. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses the question about the chronological progression of symptoms and the comparison with the husband's onset."
