    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer accurately lists denied symptoms (chest pain, faintness, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea, sputum production) with citations and infers differentials (cardiac, infectious, GI). Generated Answer incorrectly lists confirmed presenting symptoms (SOB, dry cough) as screened-for and denied; misrepresents patient's uncertainty about seizure relation as a denial; fails to identify any actual denied symptoms/exposures; provides incorrect differentials based on confirmed symptoms. Major factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: denied cardiac (chest pain, faint), infectious (taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, contacts, travel), GI (nausea, belly pain, diarrhea), dry cough (no sputum), no prior episodes. Generated covers 0% of these; instead discusses confirmed SOB/cough and seizure relation.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated misinterprets transcript: patient confirmed SOB [P-1] and dry cough [P-4], not denied; 'I don't know if related' [P-8] is not a denial of relation. Citations [D-2, P-4, P-8, P-9] are accurate but contextually twisted. Hallucinates these as 'denied' screenings; infers differentials from wrong symptoms. Multiple misrepresentations.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on denied symptoms/exposures screened and differentials they address. Generated discusses confirmed symptoms, seizure relation (not screened/denied), and mismatched differentials; barely addresses core query."
