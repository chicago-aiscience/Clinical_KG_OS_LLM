  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three main management measures: COVID swab test, 14-day isolation period, and isolation from the younger sister. All these facts are accurately extracted from [D-44] and match the Gold Answer. However, it omits important details about test result timing (24-48 hours), the explanation about false negatives and other viral illnesses, and the detailed return-to-ER precautions (high temperature, neurological symptoms, weakness, dizziness, fainting). These are significant clinical management details present in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40-50% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the three main components (COVID test, 14-day isolation, separation from sister) but misses: (1) test results timing (24-48 hours), (2) possibility of false negatives, (3) alternative diagnosis if negative (other viral illness), (4) detailed return-to-ER precautions with specific symptoms listed, (5) no medications prescribed/supportive approach, (6) school requirement for test result. The answer captures the core management but lacks important clinical details and safety-netting advice.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-44]. The citation is accurate and appropriate. No hallucinated information is present. The answer stays grounded in what was actually said during the consultation. The formatting and presentation are clear and faithful to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: diagnostic tests (COVID swab), isolation instructions and duration (14 days), and who to isolate from (younger sister). The response is well-focused with no irrelevant information. The bullet-point format makes it easy to identify each requested element. The answer is perfectly on-topic."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core management measures (COVID test, 14-day isolation, separation from sister) with accurate citations and no hallucinations. However, it is incomplete, missing important clinical details such as test result timing, return-to-ER precautions with specific warning signs, discussion of false negatives, and the supportive/observational approach. While factually accurate and highly relevant, the answer covers only about half of the key management points present in the Gold Answer."
