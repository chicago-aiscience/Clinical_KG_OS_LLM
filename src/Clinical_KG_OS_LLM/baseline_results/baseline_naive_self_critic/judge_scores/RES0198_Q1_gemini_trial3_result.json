  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the nasal symptoms (stuffy and runny nose) and their duration. However, it fails to mention the character of the discharge as 'clear' (P-5). More critically, it contains a significant factual error by stating that the transcript does not contain explicit denials for cough, sore throat, or loss of taste/smell, when these are explicitly denied in P-4, P-7, and P-16 respectively.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. It omits the color of the nasal discharge ('clear') and fails to list the requested denied symptoms (cough, sore throat, post-nasal drip, loss of taste/smell), instead incorrectly claiming they were not explicitly addressed.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer demonstrates poor faithfulness by hallucinating the absence of information. It claims the transcript lacks explicit verbal denials for symptoms that the patient clearly denies in the provided text (e.g., 'No' to coughing in P-4, 'No' to sore throat/fever in P-7).",
    "relevance": "The response follows the structure of the prompt but fails to provide the relevant information requested in the second and third parts of the question. By claiming the information is missing rather than extracting it, it fails to fully address the prompt."
