  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the dialogue concerning asthma, eczema, allergic reactions/EpiPen, and night sweats is not present in the provided text. In reality, the transcript explicitly contains these sections: night sweats at [D-9], EpiPen/allergic reactions at [D-18, D-21], personal and family asthma history at [D-29, D-30], and eczema at [D-32].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover any of the specific conditions requested in the prompt (asthma, eczema, allergic reactions, night sweats) by claiming the information is missing. It only provides a summary of general symptoms and allergies which, while in the transcript, does not answer the specific screening questions asked.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major hallucination by claiming the relevant transcript segments are missing. Additionally, it references 'Knowledge Graph information' which was not provided in the source context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant because it fails to address the core of the question, opting instead to provide a generic summary while incorrectly asserting that the specific question is unanswerable."
