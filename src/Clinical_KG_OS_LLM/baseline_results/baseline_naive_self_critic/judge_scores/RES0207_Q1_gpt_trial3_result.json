  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The respiratory (sudden shortness of breath; dry cough) and neurological (seizure last night; epilepsy) portions align with the transcript and Gold Answer. However, the Generated Answer states the patient did not provide an objective fever measurement, which directly contradicts the transcript and Gold Answer: the patient reported a measured temperature of 37.4°C that morning. This is a significant factual error in a core part of what was asked.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: sudden shortness of breath; dry cough; seizure last night; known epilepsy. Key points missed/incorrect: objective fever measurement of 37.4°C (and that it was checked that morning). Additional details in Gold (e.g., symptoms started ~3 hours prior; “fine after” seizure; pertinent negatives) were not included, though not strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references. The claim that no objective fever measurement was provided is not grounded and is contradicted by the transcript (P-5), representing a clear hallucination/negation of existing evidence.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on the asked categories (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, and fever measurement) with no major tangents. Although the fever portion is wrong, it is still attempting to address the relevant part of the question."
