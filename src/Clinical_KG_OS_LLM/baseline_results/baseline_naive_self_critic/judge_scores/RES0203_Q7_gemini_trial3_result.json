  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer captures the main facts: symptoms began two days ago, occurred concurrently, and showed no fluctuation. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript 'does not specify an order of onset' and that the patient 'does not mention having experienced similar symptoms'. In reality, the transcript contains explicit confirmation that the cough started at the same time (D-6, P-6) and an explicit denial of prior symptoms (D-3, P-3).",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the timeframe, concurrency, and lack of fluctuation. It misses the specific detail found in the Gold Answer regarding the partial nature of the sensory loss (the ability to smell strong odors and taste salty foods, but not bananas).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes minor hallucinations regarding the absence of information. It claims the patient does not mention previous experiences and that the transcript doesn't specify onset order, both of which are directly addressed in the source text (P-3 and P-6).",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the user's question regarding development, timing, fluctuation, and prior history."
