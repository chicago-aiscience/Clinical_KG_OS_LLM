  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer details present symptoms including 3-day diffuse chest tightness worsening with inspiration/exertion (walks, deep breaths, standing), difficulty full breath, upper airway hoarse/phlegm/throat clearing no cough. Generated covers tightness on breathing/walking, SOB, hoarse/phlegm/throat clearing - core facts match but misses duration, diffuse nature, specific triggers like standing/deep breath. Denied symptoms in Gold: chest pain, anxiety/sweating/doom, fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, cough - all explicit. Generated only lists chest pain and cough, incorrectly states 'transcript does not contain explicit denials' for fevers etc., which directly contradicts P-6,12-15. Doctor summaries misquoted (D-36 says patient didn't report out of breath with exercise but patient did on walks). Significant contradictions on denials.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: chest tightness (partial), difficulty breath, upper airway symptoms. Missed: 3-day history, 'all over' diffuse, specific worseners (walks/dog/standing/deep breath), full list of denials (only 2/7 covered: pain, cough; misses anxiety/sweating/doom, fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss). Covers ~30-40% of key points, half from present symptoms partially, denials minimally.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded where cited (e.g., tightness P-1/P-5, hoarse P-11 accurate). But 'transcript does not contain explicit denials for fevers etc.' is hallucinated - direct contradictions to P-6 (no anxiety/sweaty/doom), P-12 (no fevers), P-13 (no night sweats), P-14 (no chills), P-15 (no weight loss). D-36 misrepresents patient SOB on exertion. Multiple hallucinated absences/omissions.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response into Reported Symptoms (chest/respiratory/upper airway) and Explicitly Denied Symptoms, mirroring question's split. No off-topic content, focused despite incompleteness/inaccuracies."
