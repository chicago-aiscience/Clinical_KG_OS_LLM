  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the day-by-day progression consistent with the Gold Answer. Both correctly identify: (1) Wednesday evening - onset of dry cough; (2) Thursday - worsening cough and fatigue; (3) Friday - continued worsening cough, fever emergence (>100°F), decreased appetite/possible taste loss. The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but with less detail than the Gold Answer. It captures: cough onset Wednesday evening, worsening Thursday with fatigue, Friday worsening with fever and appetite changes. However, it omits some details present in the Gold Answer: the specific fever measurements (100.1 or 101°F), the runny nose mentioned on Friday [P-16], and the mother's explicit summary statement [P-12]. The correction from five to three days [P-4] is also not mentioned. Coverage is approximately 75-80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The progression timeline, symptom descriptions, and citations [P-1, P-17] are accurate. The description of the child appearing 'fine' initially, the dry cough starting Wednesday evening, worsening Thursday with tiredness, and Friday's fever and appetite changes all match the source material. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's request for day-by-day evolution from Wednesday evening through Friday, detailing when symptoms appeared and how they changed. It focuses specifically on the requested information about cough onset, severity changes, and emergence of fever and other symptoms (fatigue, decreased appetite). The response is well-organized chronologically and stays on topic throughout."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and relevant day-by-day account of the child's illness progression, correctly identifying the onset and evolution of symptoms from Wednesday through Friday. It is fully faithful to the source transcript with no hallucinations. However, it lacks some specific details present in the Gold Answer, such as precise fever measurements, the runny nose symptom, and the mother's explicit summary statement, resulting in slightly reduced completeness. Overall, it is a strong response that effectively addresses the clinical question."
