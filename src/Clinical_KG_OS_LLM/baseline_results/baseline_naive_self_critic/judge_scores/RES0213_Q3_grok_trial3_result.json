  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer diagnoses anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain, supported by specific situational patterns, anxiety history, current stress, symptom details, patient insight, and pertinent negatives. Generated Answer incorrectly diagnoses Conversion Disorder (Psychogenic Pain Disorder), which is a mismatch as the symptoms align more with anxiety somatic symptoms rather than conversion (typically motor/sensory deficits); it includes some overlapping facts (anxiety history [P-21], stress [P-13], social context) but reaches a contradictory conclusion and adds ungrounded psychodynamic explanations, constituting significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) situational alone vs. social resolution [P-4,P-9,P-29]; 2) teen anxiety hx [P-21,P-22]; 3) thesis stress [P-13,P-15,P-16]; 4) nervous breathing [P-19]; 5) patient links to stress [P-8]; 6) negatives (no fever [P-12], no exertional [P-10], rest pain [P-11], no palps [P-20], no asthma [P-23,P-24]). Generated covers anxiety hx, general stress/school, partial social context, adds med failure [P-6] and family fear [P-8]; misses precise situational details, thesis specifics, breathing details, all negatives; covers ~30-40% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Some claims grounded (anxiety hx [P-21], stress [P-13], social hints [P-20 indirectly], no med relief [P-6]); hallucinates 'knowledge graph' repeatedly (not in transcript), misapplies P-20, adds unsubstantiated psychodynamic theory ('displaced expression of conflict to gain attention'); multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly states a diagnosis and lists supporting clinical observations with transcript citations, perfectly addressing the question without off-topic content."
