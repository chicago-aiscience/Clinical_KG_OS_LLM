  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the stuffy nose as the first symptom, followed by the fever (3 days), sore throat, and muscle aches. It also accurately notes the husband's symptom duration of one week.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but is less detailed than the gold answer. It misses the specific chronological nuance that the sore throat appeared after the stuffy nose but before/around the fever onset, and it does not explicitly calculate the 'four-day' difference between the husband's and patient's onset. It also omits the clinical observation regarding household transmission mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript (P-1, P-13, P-19). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for a chronological progression and comparison with the husband's timeline."
