  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnostic test (COVID swab [D-53]) matching the Gold Answer. However, for the rationale, it attributes prioritization to the patient's fever and sore throat prompting a general rule-out of infectious diseases ([D-53]), which is partially accurate from the transcript but diverges from the Gold Answer's emphasis on epidemiological context (household transmission from husband [P-19, D-53]). It omits the specific link to the husband and does not address prioritization over influenza explicitly, leading to some factual discrepancies in the completeness of the rationale presentation compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnostic test (COVID-19 swab [D-53]). Partially covered: prioritization of COVID ([D-53] quote fragment). Missed: epidemiological context/household transmission (husband's prior symptoms [P-19]), full quote linking husband to COVID prioritization [D-53], self-isolation instruction reflecting urgency [D-53, D-54], influenza as secondary possibility after no flu shot [P-53, D-54]. Covers roughly 30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly grounded in the transcript: test ordered explicitly [D-53], quotes are verbatim and accurately cited [D-53], fever/sore throat symptoms reported by patient [P-1, etc.] and referenced by doctor. No unverifiable details or hallucinations; citations precise.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address both parts of the question (diagnostic test and rationale for prioritization), uses bold headings for clarity, and contains no off-topic or extraneous content."
