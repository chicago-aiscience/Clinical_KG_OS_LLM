  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually inconsistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify whether the cough is productive vs. non-productive; the cough is explicitly described as dry [D-5, P-5] and explicitly non-productive (no “gunk”/sputum) [D-6, P-6]. It also incorrectly claims nasal discharge is not reported; the patient reports a runny nose for the past couple of days [D-11, P-11] and describes the discharge as “pretty clear” [D-12, P-12].",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer largely missing: (1) runny nose as a second respiratory symptom and its duration; (2) clear appearance of nasal discharge; (3) cough characterized as dry and non-productive; (4) cough course stayed the same; (5) additional contextual negatives (e.g., no sore throat; no SOB/wheeze). The answer includes only partial duration information about the cough.",
    "faithfulness": "Although it references the transcript, it makes multiple claims that directly contradict explicit transcript content (productive vs non-productive not specified; nasal discharge not reported). These are not supported by the transcript, indicating poor grounding in the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic (respiratory symptoms, cough, nasal discharge), but it fails to identify the full set of reported respiratory symptoms and mischaracterizes key asked-for characteristics."
