  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the tick attachment duration reasoning from the Gold Answer, correctly citing the patient's hiking on Friday and gardening on Saturday [P-1] and the doctor's estimation of >72 hours [D-6]. However, it significantly errs on the geographic risk by falsely claiming no evidence of the doctor discussing the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map or using Strathroy's position, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [D-13], where the doctor explicitly references the map and deems Strathroy 'close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point' to justify antibiotics.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: hiking/gardening on Fri/Sat contributing to >72h duration [P-1, D-6]; Strathroy location [P-12]. Key points missed: doctor's direct reference to Lyme map, assessment of Strathroy as concerning [D-13], and how this combination justifies prophylactic treatment; uncertainty in attachment timing, time since last outdoors [D-2], leading to ~50-60% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Duration claims fully grounded and verifiable [P-1, D-6]. Map claims hallucinate absence ('do not contain evidence'), unverifiable and contradicted by [D-13]; summary of subsequent dialogue omits map mention and inaccurately focuses on other topics, introducing multiple ungrounded assertions about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address both parts of the question directly with dedicated sections, no off-topic content or tangents."
