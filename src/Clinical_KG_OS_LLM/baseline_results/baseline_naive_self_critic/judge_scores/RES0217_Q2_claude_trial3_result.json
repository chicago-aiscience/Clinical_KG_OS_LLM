    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key medications and treatments: statin for cholesterol, prophylactic antibiotics proposed for the current tick bite, and past antibiotic treatment for a previous tick bite.

    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points but omits several details present in the Gold Answer: (1) no mention of the patient seeing family physician for cholesterol management [P-14], (2) no drug allergies confirmed [P-16, P-17], (3) missing details about the 10-year timeframe and bullseye rash from past treatment, (4) omits the reasoning about >72 hours attachment time, (5) doesn't mention doctor's plan to consult supervising physician [D-13, D-22], (6) omits environmental prevention suggestion about insecticide [D-18], and (7) notes no specific antibiotic name/dose/duration stated. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",

The statin reference [P-15], prophylactic antibiotic proposal [D-6], and past antibiotic treatment [P-3] are all accurately cited and grounded in the source material. No hallucinated content detected.",

However, it lacks completeness by omitting approximately 30-40% of relevant details present in the Gold Answer, including contextual information about cholesterol management, allergy status, consultation plans, environmental prevention measures, and specific timeline/symptom details from the past treatment."
