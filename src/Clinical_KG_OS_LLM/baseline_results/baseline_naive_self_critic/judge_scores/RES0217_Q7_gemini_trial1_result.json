  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the activities (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), the patient's uncertainty regarding the exact attachment time, the location of the tick (behind the left knee), and the comparison to the episode 10 years ago (bullseye rash and engorgement levels).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points. It mentions the timeline, the discovery, and the detailed comparison of symptoms and tick engorgement. It misses the specific geographic location (Strathroy) mentioned in the Gold Answer and the doctor's specific 'little grape' analogy, but it captures the core clinical facts required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations for the patient's and doctor's statements. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, directly addressing both the timeline of exposure and the comparison between the current and past episodes without extraneous information."
