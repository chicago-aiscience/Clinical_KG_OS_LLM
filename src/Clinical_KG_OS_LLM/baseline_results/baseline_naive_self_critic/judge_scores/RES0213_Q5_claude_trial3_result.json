  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several significant factual errors. It incorrectly references a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the source material, creating fabricated causal relationships. The father did not die ('he's alive' per P-30), yet the answer implies genetic links without acknowledging this correction. The smoking numbers are correct (5 cigarettes currently, 10 previously), and the psychosocial stressors are accurately identified. However, the structural framework using a non-existent knowledge graph undermines the factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: family history (father's heart attack in 50s), smoking history (began at 18, 10/day for 2 years, now 5/day), and psychosocial stressors (Masters thesis, living alone, anxiety). However, it misses specific details like the father now seeing 'a lot of heart doctors', the paternal grandfather's unknown cardiac history, the patient living alone in London, being nervous about running, and the specific acknowledgment that anxiety attacks from teenage years may be returning. The answer covers approximately 70-80% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a critical fabrication: repeated references to a 'knowledge graph' with specific causal relationships that do not exist in the transcript. Statements like '[FAMILY_HISTORY] family history of heart attack --[CAUSES]--> [CONTEXT] stress' are entirely invented. However, most direct quotes and factual claims about the transcript are accurate (P-8, P-13, P-14, P-20, etc.). The core content is grounded in the transcript, but the analytical framework is hallucinated.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with the patient's concern about heart disease. It provides specific evidence from the consultation for each factor and attempts to explain their interactions. The structure is well-organized around the three requested factors, though the fabricated knowledge graph framework adds some off-topic content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's three main components (family history, smoking, psychosocial stressors) with relevant transcript citations, but contains a critical flaw: it fabricates a 'knowledge graph' framework that does not exist in the source material. While most direct quotes and basic facts are accurate, this hallucinated analytical structure significantly undermines faithfulness and correctness. The answer covers most but not all key points from the Gold Answer, missing details about the father's ongoing care, living situation, and specific anxieties about exercise. The relevance is high as it directly addresses the question, but the fabricated framework and incomplete coverage result in a below-average overall evaluation."
