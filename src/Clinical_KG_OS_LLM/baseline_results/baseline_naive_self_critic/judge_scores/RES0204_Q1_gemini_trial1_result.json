  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors regarding the content of the transcript. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the nature of the cough, when the patient explicitly confirms it is a 'dry' cough and non-productive [D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6]. It also incorrectly claims that nasal discharge was not mentioned, while the patient clearly reports a runny nose [P-11] that is 'pretty clear' [P-12].",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete as it misses the second respiratory symptom (runny nose) entirely and fails to provide the characteristics of the nasal discharge requested in the prompt. It also omits pertinent negatives mentioned in the gold answer like the absence of sore throat or chest pain.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer fails the faithfulness check by claiming information is 'not reported' or 'not specified' when that information is explicitly present in the source transcript. This is a form of negative hallucination (claiming absence where there is presence).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant in its structure, as it attempts to address each specific part of the user's question (duration, nature, nasal discharge), even though the content provided for those sections is factually incorrect based on the source."
