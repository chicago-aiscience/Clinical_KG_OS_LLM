  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the bronchodilator as the sole asthma medication used as-needed and administered via inhaler (equivalent to 'puffer' in transcript), matching Gold's core facts; it correctly notes the doctor asked about a daily controller medication that the patient lacks. Minor discrepancies include incorrect citation (P-1 does not specify 'inhaler'; that's in P-7/D-7) and inferring the controller as specifically an 'inhaler' (plausible but not explicit in Gold or transcript phrasing). No major errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: bronchodilator as only med (100%), as-needed use implied, administration as inhaler/puffer (100%), doctor asked about daily controller ('every day no matter what'), patient does not have it (100%). Partially covers confirmations of no other meds and increased use context (80-99% overall; misses exact multiple denials like P-6/P-30 and full clinical significance phrasing).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: bronchodilator (P-1, D-4), helps/acute use (P-1, P-4), puffer/inhaler verifiable (D-7/P-7), increased use (P-8/P-9), daily med asked (D-5/P-5). Minor issues: P-1 citation inaccurate for 'inhaler', 'controller inhaler' plausible (context of asthma meds) but not verbatim; no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question's three parts (only med: bronchodilator; administration: inhaler; daily controller asked about/not had) in structured format; minor tangents on usage triggers (P-9) are relevant to asthma context but not extraneous."
