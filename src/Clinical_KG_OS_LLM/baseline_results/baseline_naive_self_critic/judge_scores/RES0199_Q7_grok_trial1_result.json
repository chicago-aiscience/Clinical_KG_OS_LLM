  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the initial symptoms (headache and cough four days ago) matching Gold [P-1]. GI symptoms are noted as 'few days back' after initial, aligning with Gold's 'few days back' for nausea/vomiting and specifying diarrhea ~2 days, though less precise. Loss of smell one day ago matches exactly [P-24]. Dry cough correct [P-12]. Stability of headache/cough implied via 'persistent' [P-3] and overall duration, but Gold explicitly states 'stayed around the same' [P-9, P-11]; no contradictions, but minor lack of precision on severity/location/details.",
    "completeness": "Covered: initial symptoms/timing (100%), GI relative onset (few days, lists N/V/D), loss of smell timing (100%), dry cough. Missed/partial: explicit stability ('stayed the same' for H/C), headache details (bilateral forehead/top, 7/10, atypical), precise GI (diarrhea exactly 2 days/5-6x/day liquid, vomiting yesterday 2x food contents, nausea today), pertinent negatives (no fever/chills, no resp worsening). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: [P-1] initial/GI, [P-24] smell, [P-12] dry cough, [P-3] persistent. No unverifiable or hallucinated details; 'implying ... did not resolve quickly' is reasonable interpretation grounded in quotes.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response as numbered timeline addressing question's specifics: first symptoms, GI/smell relative to initial, H/C characteristics (persistent implying stable). No off-topic content, fully focused though less detailed on stability."
