  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as 'cardiac ischemia' (minor rephrasing of Gold's 'cardiac ischemic picture'), accurately notes tightness without pain per transcript [P-5, D-36], and references patient difficulty breathing [P-7]; however, it inaccurately frames 'difficulty breathing' as key without Gold's nuance of non-classic exertional dyspnea [D-36], omits anxiety/sweating/doom denials [D-6, P-6], and core facts are mostly consistent with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covers: condition (100%), nature of complaints as tightness without pain (~50%, misses exertional dyspnea nuance); absence of pain (partial, ~25%, misses anxiety/sweaty/doom); total ~60-70% of Gold key points (e.g., misses specific clinician screening [D-5,D-6], patient relief [P-35], combination rationale).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like tightness, no pain, difficulty breathing verifiable [P-1,P-5,P-7,D-36]; citations accurate; however, hallucinates 'knowledge graph' and 'no pain RULES_OUT cardiac ischemia' structure/findings not in transcript, introducing unverifiable external logic.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by naming condition and categorizing evidence into nature/absence as specified; minor irrelevance via fabricated knowledge graph reference."
