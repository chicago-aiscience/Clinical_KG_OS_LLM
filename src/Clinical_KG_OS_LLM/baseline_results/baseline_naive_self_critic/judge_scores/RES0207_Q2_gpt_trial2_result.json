  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s medication (matches P-23) and accurately quotes that the patient “kind of forgot to take my med” (P-9). However, it frames the circumstance leading to the missed dose only as generic forgetting, whereas the transcript specifies the situational reason (daughter’s birthday, altered routine/no usual dinner), so it is not fully accurate to the question’s intent.",
    "completeness": "Key points in Gold Answer: (1) Keppra for epilepsy; (2) missed dose acknowledged; (3) specific circumstance: daughter’s birthday celebration, routine changed, usually taken with dinner but dinner timing changed/was skipped; (4) it was an isolated lapse rather than ongoing adherence issue; (5) patient suggests missed dose contributed to seizure. Generated answer includes (1) and part of (2) only, missing (3) entirely and omitting (4) and (5).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (P-23, P-9). No hallucinated details or unsupported inferences are present.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic (medication and reason for missed dose) but does not provide the requested specific circumstance, so it only partially addresses the question."
