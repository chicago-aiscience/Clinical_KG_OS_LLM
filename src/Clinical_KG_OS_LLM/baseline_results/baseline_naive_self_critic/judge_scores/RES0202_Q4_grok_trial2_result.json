  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition that would have been added to the differential if there was no fever, based on [D-45], and states that fever led to excluding it in favor of infection. The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies 'another viral illness' ([D-44]) as the condition, claims fever and dry cough led to excluding it for COVID workup, which misrepresents the transcript where viral illness remains a possibility even after COVID testing. This is a complete factual contradiction with no alignment to Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Condition = asthma; (2) Added if just cough/shortness of breath without fever [D-45]; (3) Excluded due to fever, sounds like infection [D-45]; (4) Supporting no wheezing [P-7], uncertain SOB [P-8]. Generated covers 0% of these, instead discussing viral illness and COVID swab.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites [D-44] accurately for 'another viral illness' and symptoms aligning with COVID, but hallucinates that fever/dry cough 'exclude viral illness as immediate focus'—transcript keeps viral as possible ('it could be another viral illness'). Mentions non-existent 'knowledge graph information.' Ignores [D-45] entirely, introducing ungrounded exclusion logic. Multiple hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for condition doctor said would be added if presentation different (asthma without fever) and finding excluding it (fever). Generated discusses COVID vs. viral illness workup, which does not address the hypothetical differential addition or exclusion from [D-45]; entirely off-topic."
