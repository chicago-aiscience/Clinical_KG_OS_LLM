  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns well with the gold answer. It accurately identifies the physical exam components (heart and lungs) and the multi-step process involving consultation with a colleague and returning to discuss the plan with the patient.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary requirements of the prompt: the physical exam components and the process for next steps. However, it omits some contextual details present in the gold answer, specifically that the plan was initially mentioned at the start of the encounter (D-1), that the patient agreed to the plan (P-37), and the observation that no diagnosis or medication was provided at that stage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript, specifically referencing turn [D-37]. It does not hallucinate information.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific questions asked without adding extraneous information."
