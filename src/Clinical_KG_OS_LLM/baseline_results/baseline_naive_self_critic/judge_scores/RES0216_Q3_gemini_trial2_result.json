  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the primary clinical reasoning used by the doctor, specifically the link between asthma history, medication non-compliance, and the absence of cardiac pain. However, it incorrectly attributes hoarseness and phlegm as primary drivers of the diagnosis, whereas the transcript and gold answer focus on the exertional tightness. It also introduces a 'knowledge graph' concept which is not in the text.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses approximately 40% of the key points found in the gold answer, including the lack of environmental triggers, the patient's own suspicion that the symptoms might be related to asthma, and the specific diagnostic use of a therapeutic trial with rescue puffers mentioned in D-35.",
    "faithfulness": "The majority of the content is well-grounded in the transcript. However, the phrase 'supported by the knowledge graph relationship' is a hallucination/meta-commentary that does not appear in the source text and reflects external model training rather than the provided dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on the symptoms, history, and the doctor's logic as requested by the prompt."
