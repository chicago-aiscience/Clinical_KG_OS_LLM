  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the main symptoms and the specific characteristic symptom (loss of smell). However, it attributes the link between loss of taste/smell and COVID-19 to a 'knowledge graph' which is not mentioned in the transcript or gold answer, representing a minor factual deviation in the reasoning process.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses some elements provided in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits 'fatigue' from the initial list of symptoms and completely misses the 'pertinent negatives' (no fever, no runny nose, no muscle aches) which the Gold Answer includes as part of the diagnostic process.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a minor hallucination by referencing a 'knowledge graph' and specific diagrammatic links (e.g., [DIAGNOSIS] covid --[INDICATES]--> [SYMPTOM] loss of taste) that are not present in the provided source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the user's question with clear headings."
