{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors. It misses 'difficulty breathing' and 'reduced sense of taste,' which were key reported symptoms. Most significantly, it claims the patient did not explicitly deny cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, or chest pain, while the transcript shows the patient clearly saying 'No' to each of these. It also incorrectly categorizes 'Loss of Smell' under 'Reported Symptoms' despite the patient denying it.",
    "completeness": "The answer is missing 40% of the reported symptoms (difficulty breathing and reduced sense of taste) and fails to list 5 out of 6 explicit denials mentioned in the Gold Answer. It misses the timeline and progression details for the symptoms it does mention.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source text. It claims the patient did not explicitly deny certain symptoms, which directly contradicts transcript segments P-15 through P-18 and P-23, where the patient provides clear negative responses. This constitutes a hallucination of an absence of information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure and intent, as it specifically addresses the categories requested by the prompt (Reported Symptoms vs. Denials), despite the data within those categories being incorrect."
