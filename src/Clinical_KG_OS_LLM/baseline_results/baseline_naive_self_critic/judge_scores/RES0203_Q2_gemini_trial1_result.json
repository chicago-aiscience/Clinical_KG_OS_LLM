  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the patient had not tried any medications or treatments prior to the visit. It also correctly identifies the recommended COVID-19 swab and the instructions for self-isolation and timing of results. One minor point: the generated answer cites the opening statement as the lack of evidence for prior treatment, whereas the gold answer points to the explicit 'No' in P-9.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses the doctor's mention that there 'might be a couple other tests' and that the plan would be reviewed with a supervising physician, which were included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes a few minor hallucinations: it specifies a 'nasal' swab (the transcript only says 'swab') and repeatedly references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source context. However, the core clinical facts remain grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses the question regarding prior treatments and recommended interventions."
