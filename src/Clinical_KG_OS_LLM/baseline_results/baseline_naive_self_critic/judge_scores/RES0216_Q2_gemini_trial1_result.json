  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three medications (Ramipril, Salbutamol, Tylenol) and their respective conditions (high blood pressure, asthma, headaches). However, it fails to provide the specific detail found in the Gold Answer regarding the change from a twice-daily (morning and night) regimen to a once-daily (morning only) regimen.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to describe the prescribed dosing frequency (twice daily) versus the actual usage (morning only). It also misses the specific reason for the rescue inhaler's unavailability (the patient has not refilled it in a couple of years). These specifics were explicitly requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The clinical facts provided are grounded in the transcript. However, the Generated Answer repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' to justify relationships (e.g., between Salbutamol and asthma), which is not part of the provided transcript. This introduces external context not found in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant as it directly addresses all components of the question (medications, conditions, and adherence changes), although the depth of the adherence section is insufficient compared to the prompt's requirements."
