  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC products used for chest discomfort (Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer) and correctly reports they were not very effective, consistent with [P-6]. However, it incorrectly states the patient did not report any routine OTC medications/supplements; the patient explicitly reports taking a multivitamin ([P-25]). This is a direct contradiction of the transcript/Gold Answer and affects the core of the question (“regular routine”).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Tylenol tried, (2) Advil tried, (3) Alka‑Seltzer tried, (4) all not helpful, (5) daily multivitamin as routine supplement, (6) no other medications/prescriptions besides multivitamin. Generated Answer covers (1)-(4) but omits (5) and (6), and in fact negates (5). Coverage is roughly ~50–65% of the key required items for this question.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with correct citations for Tylenol/Advil/Alka‑Seltzer and lack of benefit ([P-6]) and smoking reduction ([P-13], [P-14]). But the claim that the patient did not report any routine OTC meds/supplements is not faithful to [P-25] (multivitamin). This is a notable ungrounded/contradictory assertion.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on OTC medications/supplements and effectiveness, which directly answers the question. The added smoking discussion is a minor tangent (and not an OTC medication/supplement), but it does not dominate the answer."

  "summary": "Accurately captures the OTC pain-relief attempts and their lack of benefit, but wrongly denies the routine multivitamin use and omits that it was the only ongoing supplement/medication, reducing correctness, completeness, and faithfulness."
