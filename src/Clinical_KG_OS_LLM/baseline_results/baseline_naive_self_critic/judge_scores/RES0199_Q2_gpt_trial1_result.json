  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol (acetaminophen) as the home medication and correctly links it to headache relief (supported by P-3 and P-4). It accurately reports the clinician’s supportive-care recommendations from D-52: hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol as an antipyretic if fever develops, and Tylenol or NSAIDs for muscle/joint aches. It does not introduce any clear factual contradictions to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Tylenol taken at home, (2) symptom targeted = headache, (3) supportive care: hydrate, nutritious food, sleep, (4) meds: Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches. Key Gold Answer points missed: ordering a COVID swab test and instructing isolation for 14 days while awaiting results (both in D-52 and included in the Gold Answer’s management plan). It also does not mention the patient’s self-initiated hydration effort pre-visit (P-30), which is noted in the Gold Answer (though this is less central to the question wording).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate line references. However, the answer references a “knowledge graph relationship” (e.g., '[TREATMENT] tylenol --[TAKEN_FOR]--> [SYMPTOM] headache'), which is not present in the Source Transcript. This is a minor ungrounded addition, but the clinical content itself remains transcript-consistent.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements: home medication + targeted symptom, and the clinician’s recommended additional medications and supportive measures. The only minor irrelevance is mentioning a “knowledge graph,” which is not necessary for answering the question."
