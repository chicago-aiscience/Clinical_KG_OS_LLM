  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer regarding the diagnostic tests (X-ray, COVID swab) and the consultation with the supervising physician. However, it omits the physical examination of the lungs and heart which was explicitly part of the plan communicated in [D-1].",
    "completeness": "The response covers most key points including the specific tests and the follow-up process. It misses the physical examination step (lungs and heart) which is highlighted in the gold answer as part of the visit structure.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, using direct quotes and accurate citations for all claims, including specific details like the mention of Roller Coaster Tycoon.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses the question about the doctor's plan for the pediatric patient."
