  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated working diagnosis (“most likely a viral infection like the common cold”), the supportive care items explicitly mentioned (hydrate; OTC meds like Tylenol Cold), the COVID swab testing with results in ~48 hours, and the isolation/public health follow-up guidance. It does not introduce clinically incorrect details. Minor precision issue: it does not explicitly state the swab would be done “today,” which is stated in the transcript/gold answer, but this is an omission rather than a contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: \n- Working diagnosis: viral infection/common cold (covered)\n- Supportive care: stay well hydrated (covered)\n- Supportive care: OTC meds like Tylenol Cold (covered)\n- Diagnostic test: COVID swab (covered)\n- Results timeframe: ~48 hours (covered)\n- Public health guidance: isolate at home and avoid others (covered)\n- Public health follow-up: further instructions from public health (covered)\n\nKey Gold Answer elements missed/under-specified:\n- Expectation-setting that symptoms can take “a few weeks” to resolve (missed)\n- Explicit statement that there is not much beyond supportive care for viral infection (missed)\n- The swab being performed “today” (not stated)\n\nOverall, it captures most major components but not all details included in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly grounded in [D-39]. The only extraneous phrase is “Based on the clinical transcript and knowledge graph,” which is not in the transcript but does not add clinical content. No evident hallucinated medical recommendations beyond what was stated.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on exactly what was asked: diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test ordered (and timing), and public health guidance. No meaningful irrelevant tangents."
