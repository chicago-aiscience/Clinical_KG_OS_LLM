[D-1] D: How can I help you today?

[P-1] P: Um yeah hi, I brought I brought my 8 year old daughter here um because I've noticed that she's been quite wheezy um for the past four five days and now she has a slight cough, um sounds like she's a little short of breath, so I just wanted to get things checked out.

[D-2] D: OK, so for the, when it first presented, about four to five days ago, what did you notice, notice first?

[P-2] P: Um I noticed that she was wheezy um and it's it seemed like she was having some difficulty taking in deep breaths.

[D-3] D: OK, now was this with any type of activity or just at rest?

[P-3] P: Yeah, she was playing tag with one of her cousins and she she was quite out of breath after.

[D-4] D: OK, has she ever had anything like this before?

[P-4] P: No.

[D-5] D: Nothing like that, OK, and has it been fairly steady since then? Or has it been fluctuating?

[P-5] P: It's been fluctuating.

[D-6] D: OK, but it hasn't really gone away in the sense that you're still concerned coming now four days later?

[P-6] P: Yeah, it's just it would, she would have these these uh episodes, but it would resolve on its own and then she would, you know go back to doing some sort of activity and then she would have all these symptoms all over again, but when she rests um then it goes away, so I wasn't really sure, too sure what to think of it. But now I think it's important to get it checked out, so here we are.

[D-7] D: Has she had any fevers at home?

[P-7] P: No.

[D-8] D: Has she had a runny nose at all at home?
