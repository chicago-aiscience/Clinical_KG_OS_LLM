    "question": "What specific local symptoms did the patient report at the tick bite site behind her left knee, and which systemic symptoms — including fever, joint pain, and headaches — did the doctor screen for that the patient denied experiencing?",
    "gold_answer": "Local symptoms: The patient reported the tick was behind her left knee, in the crease where the leg bends, and was \"stuck pretty good\" [P-1]. She noticed it because the back of her knee \"was starting to just feel a bit sore,\" clarifying the soreness was of the skin and surrounding area, \"not the joint itself\" [P-1]. She described the site as \"still kind of red and tender\" [P-1] and later confirmed it \"looks a little red\" and is \"tender where the tick was\" [P-6]. She explicitly denied seeing the bullseye or \"target\" rash from her prior experience, observing only localized redness without the \"larger circle rash\" [P-6]. She stated she was \"totally fine\" aside from the local tenderness [P-18] and described herself as \"pretty healthy\" [P-13]. Systemic screening and pertinent negatives: The doctor asked about joint pain [D-7], which the patient denied [P-7]. The doctor screened for feeling ill or feverish [D-8], denied by the patient [P-8]. The doctor asked about headaches [D-19], also denied [P-19, P-20]."

    "question": "What medications and treatments were discussed during this consultation, including the patient's current statin therapy and any new prophylactic treatments proposed by the doctor for the tick bite?",
    "gold_answer": "Current medications: The patient reported seeing her family physician for cholesterol management [P-14] and taking a statin, though she could not recall the specific name [P-15]. She denied any allergies [P-16] and specifically confirmed no drug allergies [P-17]. Past treatment history: The patient recalled a prior tick bite approximately 10 years ago with a bullseye/\"target rash\" that required her to \"take antibiotics for a bit\" [P-3]. New prophylactic treatment proposed: The doctor recommended prophylactic antibiotics, explaining that because the tick had likely been attached longer than 72 hours, \"we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic\" to prevent Lyme disease [D-6]. He later reiterated it was \"probably safer than not to start you on some medications\" [D-18] and confirmed \"we will be moving forward with antibiotics\" [D-13]. No specific antibiotic name, dose, or duration was stated. The doctor planned to consult the supervising physician before finalizing the plan [D-13, D-22]. Environmental prevention: The doctor suggested the patient consider using \"some insecticide\" in her garden to reduce tick exposure [D-18]."

    "id": "Q3",
    "type": "diagnostic_reasoning",
    "question": "What combination of exposure history, estimated tick attachment duration, geographic risk assessment, and the patient's prior history of a tick bite with bullseye rash led the doctor to recommend prophylactic antibiotics, even though the tick did not visually resemble a deer tick and no bullseye rash was currently present?",
    "gold_answer": "The doctor's recommendation rested on multiple converging risk factors. Exposure history: The patient reported hiking on Friday and gardening on Saturday [P-1], and was uncertain which activity led to attachment: \"I don't really know when I got it\" [P-1]. Tick attachment duration: The doctor noted \"it's been a little bit of time\" since outdoor exposure [D-2] and calculated the tick had been on her for \"longer than at least 72 hours\" [D-6], justifying prophylaxis. Geographic risk: The patient specified hiking in \"Strathroy along the creek\" [P-12]; the doctor consulted an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map and assessed Strathroy as \"close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point\" [D-13]. Prior history: The patient described a tick bite approximately 10 years ago that produced a bullseye/\"target rash\" and required antibiotics [P-3]. Despite the tick not visually resembling a deer tick [P-5] and no current bullseye rash [P-6], the patient had heard that \"lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme\" [P-5]. The doctor proposed sending the tick to a lab for species identification [D-6] and concluded it was \"probably safer than not\" to begin prophylaxis [D-18]."

    "question": "What specific clinical features of active Lyme disease did the doctor assess for and find absent in this patient, and what diagnostic tests were proposed to further evaluate or definitively exclude Lyme disease as a concern?",
    "gold_answer": "Clinical features assessed and found absent: The hallmark erythema migrans (bullseye rash) was asked about [D-6] and denied, with only localized redness and tenderness without the \"larger circle rash\" [P-6]. Joint pain was screened for [D-7] and denied [P-7]. Fever and systemic illness were asked about [D-8] and denied [P-8]. Headaches were screened for [D-19] and denied [P-19, P-20]. The doctor confirmed the patient had been \"feeling well otherwise\" [D-18], which the patient affirmed as \"totally fine\" [P-18]. The patient also confirmed no other bites on herself or her husband [P-9]. Diagnostic tests proposed [D-18]: (1) a physical examination of the bite site; (2) sending the tick specimen the patient brought in a plastic container [P-1] to a local laboratory for definitive species identification to determine if it is a deer tick, the primary Lyme vector [D-5, D-6, D-18]; and (3) blood work to check for \"titres or any serology\" indicating Lyme disease [D-18]. The doctor also planned to consult a supervising physician before finalizing the plan [D-13, D-22]. No test results were available during the consultation."

    "id": "Q5",
    "type": "risk_factors",
    "question": "How did the patient's hiking in Strathroy on Friday and gardening on Saturday contribute to an estimated tick attachment duration exceeding 72 hours, and how did the doctor use Strathroy's position on the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map to further justify the need for prophylactic treatment?",
    "gold_answer": "Attachment duration reasoning: The patient reported hiking on Friday and extensive gardening on Saturday [P-1], with uncertainty about when the tick attached: \"I don't really know when I got it\" [P-1]. She discovered and removed the tick \"earlier today\" [D-1]. The doctor noted \"it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it\" [D-2] and calculated that the tick had been on her for \"longer than at least 72 hours\" [D-6]. Given this prolonged attachment, the doctor stated \"we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic\" [D-6]. Geographic risk justification: The patient specified hiking in \"Strathroy along the creek\" [P-12]. The doctor referenced an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map and assessed that \"Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point\" [D-13], placing the exposure in a region with documented Lyme risk. The combination of prolonged attachment duration and geographic concern led the doctor to conclude \"we will be moving forward with antibiotics\" [D-13]."

    "question": "What was the doctor's comprehensive clinical plan at the end of the consultation, including all proposed diagnostic tests (laboratory and physical), prescribed or recommended treatments, planned physician consultation, and preventive advice given to the patient about her garden and outdoor environment?",
    "gold_answer": "The doctor outlined a multi-component plan. Diagnostic tests: (1) A \"quick physical exam\" of the bite site [D-18]; (2) sending the tick specimen brought in a plastic container [P-1] to a local laboratory for species identification [D-6, D-18]; and (3) blood work for Lyme disease \"titres or any serology\" [D-18]. Treatment: Prophylactic antibiotics recommended due to tick attachment exceeding 72 hours [D-6] and geographic risk from Strathroy [D-13]. The doctor stated it was \"probably safer than not to start you on some medications\" [D-18] and confirmed \"moving forward with antibiotics\" [D-13]. No specific antibiotic name, dose, or duration was stated. Physician consultation: The doctor planned to \"go talk to the doctor\" [D-22] and referenced \"the physician who'll be having a look at you as well\" [D-13], indicating a trainee-supervised encounter requiring attending confirmation. Preventive advice: The doctor explained that \"ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields,\" described ticks making a \"waving motion with their legs,\" and suggested the patient \"might wanna get some insecticide out there\" for her garden [D-18]."

    "question": "How did the timeline of the patient's tick exposure unfold from hiking on Friday through gardening on Saturday to discovery of the tick and presentation to the doctor, and how did the patient compare the current episode's local symptoms and tick engorgement to her prior tick bite experience approximately 10 years ago that involved a bullseye rash and antibiotic treatment?",
    "gold_answer": "Timeline: The patient reported hiking in Strathroy on Friday and extensive gardening on Saturday [P-1]. She was uncertain when the tick attached: \"I don't really know when I got it,\" and hoped it came from hiking rather than her garden [P-1]. She discovered the tick \"earlier today\" when the back of her left knee \"was starting to just feel a bit sore\" [P-1], prompting inspection and discovery of the embedded tick in the knee crease [P-1, D-1]. She removed it and brought it in a \"little plastic container\" [P-1]. The doctor estimated attachment at \"longer than at least 72 hours\" [D-6]. Comparison to prior episode (~10 years ago): The patient described a previous tick bite that produced a bullseye/\"target rash thing\" and required antibiotic treatment [P-3]. Key contrasts: the prior tick was \"quite swollen\" with engorgement, whereas the current tick was \"pretty small\" [P-4] and only \"maybe a little bit\" engorged, \"but not as much\" [P-3]. The doctor confirmed the current tick did not resemble an engorged \"little grape\" [D-4]. The prior bite produced the classic bullseye rash, whereas the current bite shows only localized redness and tenderness without the \"larger circle rash\" [P-6]."
