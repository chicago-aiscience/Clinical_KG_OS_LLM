[D-2] D: OK, so if I understand, it started with a stuffy nose?

[P-2] P: Yes.

[D-3] D: OK and that kinda progressed to a fever?

[D-18] D: OK, have you had any recent travel anywhere else?

[P-18] P: No, I did go hiking um last weekend, um and it was about 2 hours away, um there were some people on the hiking trail that I passed by, but um other than that, no travel outside the province.

[D-33] D: No, anything you've had to see a doctor for?

[P-33] P: Um I, in the past couple of years uh just for things like like this I guess um colds, um I'm pre diabetic, so I've been checking my glucose levels, yeah other than that nothing else.

[D-34] D: So no high blood pressure?

[P-34] P: No.

[D-35] D: No cholesterol issues?

[P-35] P: No.

[D-36] D: OK, so it sounds like you've been pretty healthy otherwise.

[P-36] P: Yeah.

[D-37] D: Excellent, OK. Do you have any allergies? To medications or otherwise.

[P-42] P: So I work from home as a digital marketing agent and my husband is a computer programmer.

[D-43] D: OK. And do you smoke?

[P-43] P: No.

[D-44] D: Do you drink alcohol?

[P-44] P: Uh I drink once once in a while.

[D-45] D: OK. And when you drink, how many drinks do you have?

[P-45] P: Um about one or two glasses of wine.

[D-46] D: Got it. Any other recreational drugs, substances?

[P-46] P: Um no,

[D-47] D: So no marijuana, heroin, cocaine?

[P-47] P: I've tried marijuana before, just like edibles, but not, not regularly.

[D-48] D: Understood. And have you ever used IV drugs?

[P-48] P: No.

[D-49] D: OK, and when was your last menstrual period?

[P-49] P: It was um a year ago.

[D-50] D: A year ago?

[P-50] P: Mhmm.

[D-51] D: OK. And then otherwise, so we talked a little bit about recent travel. It sounds like you have the hiking trip last week and you passed some people, but it sounds like your husband also has kind of similar symptoms that you do right now.

[P-51] P: Yeah.

[D-52] D: Sounds good, now we've already talked about kind of past medical issues. Moving on, I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam. But before I do that, do you have any questions for me? Anything else you feel I should know?

[P-52] P: No, do you think I have covid?

[D-53] D: It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out, so we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what. Obviously with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So it sounds like if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So just while we're trying to investigate, work this up further, I want to have you and your husband self isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gotten your flu shot this year?

[P-53] P: No, I haven't.

[D-54] D: So it's also a possibility it might be influenza, just the seasonal flu. But until we, I suppose rule out covid, it'd be best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious for the meanwhile.

[P-54] P: OK, sure.

[D-55] D: Alright, well I'm going to go talk to the Doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you, OK?

[P-55] P: Alright, great thank you.

[D-56] D: Take care.
