[D-47] D: Got it, alright, and we're just kind of going over things,so it sounds like you've had this cough or a cough for a little while but it's only become bad in the last three days. You're waking up at night and you're kind of bringing up this foul or not this foul but this kind of greenish sputum, but it's, no blood in it, and otherwise you don't have any constitutional symptoms so I will go review your story with the doctors. Anything else you'd like to bring up with them before I go?

[P-47] P: I don't think so, I just like I like I hope I just can feel better 'cause I've been missing like my exercise stuff 'cause I feel like it's just like coughing and it makes it hard to like do well.

[D-48] D: Got it, got it. We'll see what we can do. OK, thank you very much.

[P-48] P: OK, thanks.
