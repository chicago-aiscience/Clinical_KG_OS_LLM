[D-1] I do for you.
[P-1] Hi, I came in here today.
[D-2] I just was feeling just a bit short of breath over the last few days and I've had a,
[P-2] so I normally have a cough but I've just been coughing a lot more over the last week
[D-3] and I don't know if it's something else.
[P-3] I do have a COPD diagnosis which I was diagnosed with like a couple years ago but this
[D-4] seems to be much worse.
[P-4] Okay.
[D-5] You said you were diagnosed with COPD a couple years ago?
[P-5] Was that two years ago, three years ago?
[D-6] It was almost probably five years ago.
[P-6] Five years ago, okay.
[D-7] And have you always had this cough since then?
[P-7] Yeah, I've probably had a cough for the last ten years I think.
[D-8] Okay.
[P-8] And you mentioned that this cough has gotten worse over the last week?
[D-9] Yeah, I've been coughing a lot more even just walking down the stairs for my bedroom to
[P-9] even the kitchen.
[D-10] I just have to take a little bit of a breather and just start coughing.
[P-10] Okay.
[D-11] And is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any fun?
[P-11] No, I'm bringing up like this.
[D-12] It's usually before this week it was like kind of a clear to yellow, sorry, clear to white
[P-12] material but this past week it's been more yellow and colored.
[D-13] Okay.
[P-13] Any blood in there?
[D-14] No, I'm in no, it's any blood.
[P-14] Okay.
[D-15] And you said you were also short of breath.
[P-15] When did that start?
[D-16] That's just been the last few days.
[P-16] But just to clarify, you get short of breath here and there sometimes I have to use pufferies
[D-17] but the last few days I've just been really short of breath.
[P-17] Even if I walk a little bit after like sit down and can't really catch my breath.
[D-18] Okay.
[P-18] All right.
[D-19] And do you get short of breath when you're laying down?
[P-19] No, not really.
[D-20] It's mainly just when I'm moving around and doing stuff.
[P-20] Okay.
[D-21] How about when you're asleep, does it wake you up and kind of make a guess for air?
[P-21] No.
[D-22] No.
[P-22] Okay.
[D-23] So no orthopnea or PND.
[P-23] All right.
[D-24] So the puffers that you're on, can you remind me which ones you're on again?
[P-24] So I'm on this one called Ventolin for the job in using a lot more recently just for
[D-25] relief.
[P-25] And then I'm on this other puffer.
[D-26] I think it's called Spiriva.
[P-26] Okay.
[D-27] How often, how many times this week have you had to use your Ventolin?
[P-27] I'm, um, Ventolin, I've probably used probably almost like 10 times this past week.
[D-28] Okay.
[P-28] All right.
[D-29] Any chest pain?
[P-29] Um, just when I'm having like those coughing with the breathing, I feel some discomfort,
[D-30] but that's it.
[P-30] Okay.
[D-31] Okay.
[P-31] Um, all right.
[D-32] And then any, um, palpitations are feeling like your heart's racing?

[P-52] chilly.
[D-53] Um, but I, I don't know, I have a fever or anything like that.
[P-53] Okay.
[D-54] Um, so you have an actual measure of your temperature, right?

[D-63] What's the COPD?
[P-63] Do you have any other, along standing medical conditions?
[D-64] Um, I, I have, like, a high cholesterol.
[P-64] Okay.
[D-65] And, uh, just, uh, I used to take blood pressure medication, but, uh, I don't right now.
[P-65] Okay.
[D-66] Um, what kind of blood pressure medication should you use to take and?
[P-66] and how can you stop?
[D-67] I was on like a diuretic,
[P-67] and then the doctor said like my blood pressure
[D-68] was really well under control,
[P-68] so I just stopped taking it.
[D-69] Okay, okay.
[P-69] And the doctor was okay with that?
[D-70] No, I just stopped taking it.
[P-70] I didn't really like ask the doctor.
[D-71] Okay, well, we'll keep checking your blood pressure,
[P-71] and that's something you should keep an eye on as well,
[D-72] just in case you have complications with your kidneys.
[P-72] Does that sound okay?
[D-73] Yeah.
[P-73] Okay.
[D-74] And are you on any medications other than the puffers?
[P-74] Just a two-poise study.
[D-75] For your cholesterol, okay.
[P-75] Do you have to date with your immunizations?
[D-76] Yeah.
[P-76] Even a vaccine.
[D-77] Pardon me?
[P-77] I even got the coronavirus vaccine.
[D-78] Okay, good. Congrats.
[P-78] Did you also get the shingles vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine?
[D-79] Yeah, I got the vaccine.
[P-79] Okay, good.
[D-80] Any allergies?
[P-80] No, not that I know.
[D-81] How about family history of lung or heart conditions?
[P-81] My father had lung cancer,
[D-82] but he smoked a lot.
[P-82] I also smoked, so I sometimes worry about that.
[D-83] But all that lung cancer and my mother,
[P-83] she was perfectly healthy.
[D-84] Yeah, so just my father.
[P-84] That's your father.
[D-85] Okay. How much do you smoke?
[P-85] Probably half a pack a day.
[D-86] It used to be one pack,
[P-86] even two packs at one point in time.
[D-87] But right now, it's half a pack a day.
[P-87] Okay.
[D-88] All right. Well, it's good that you're cutting down.
[P-88] And if you need more resources to help you do that,
[D-89] we have some available that we can refer you to.
[P-89] Do you take any other recreational drugs?
[D-90] Cannabis, heroin, cocaine?
[P-90] No, nothing like that.
[D-91] No, I'm okay. And do you drink alcohol?
[P-91] Just probably maybe like a couple of times a month.
[D-92] A couple of times a month. Okay.
[P-92] And are you currently married?
[D-93] Yeah, I currently live with my...
[P-93] Wife?
[D-94] And in other words?
[P-94] Okay. And any reason for you to believe you have old carpets,
[D-95] small dust, asbestos, pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms?
[P-95] No, nothing like that. We live in like a fairly new apartment.
[D-96] Okay. Okay, good.
[P-96] And have you been in contact with any sick people recently?
[D-97] No, not really. We've been just to ourselves.
[P-97] Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
[D-98] No, just been in our house.
[P-98] Okay. All right. Well, those were all the questions that I had.
[D-99] Did you have any questions of your own?
[P-99] Yeah, I was just wondering what this can be.
[D-100] Yeah, you know, it sounds like you have a cough and churnus of breath.
[P-100] And both of these things you've had for a while, but now they're getting worse.
[D-101] And based on your past history of COPD, I would say this sounds like a COPD exacerbation.
[P-101] So for that, we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC,
[D-102] electrolytes, your kidney function, ABGs, as well as like a chest X-ray.
[P-102] And basically, to treat it, we're going to take your oxygen saturation
[D-103] and give you some extra oxygen if you need it.
[P-103] We'll continue to use your bronchodilators.
[D-104] And in addition to both of that, we'll also give you some steroids,
[P-104] as well as antibiotics, just to prevent any infections or if you already have it,
[D-105] then it can help with that as well.
[P-105] And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those that COVID will also do a COVID swap
[D-106] and make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours.
[P-106] How does that sound?
[D-107] That sounds good. Thank you.
[P-107] Okay, I know. Problem.
