And that's on to you. Sounds great. Thank you. Awesome. Okay, so it says here that you've been having a source row. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Sure. Yeah, the source row, it started about four days ago. And it's really, it's very sore. I can drink fluids, okay, but I'm even having some issues swallowing food. Okay, so you said four days ago? Yes, four days ago. Okay, so it's been kind of sore, some issues swallowing food. Okay, and over the last four days has it gotten worse better? I'm going to stay the same. Um, the source row has got, it's getting worse for sure. Okay, I've never had anything like this before. Um, I guess when I was younger, I had mono and I had a source row when I had that, yeah. Okay, is there anything that makes it worse or really anything that makes it feel better right now? Um, no, not really. I've tried, you know, I've tried gargling with salt water, I've tried some painkillers, like nothing, nothing seems to be working. Okay, um, okay, and you said you've also had some difficulty breathing? Yes, that started around the same time? That actually started yesterday and it's gotten me very concerned. Okay, I can understand how that would be concerning. We're definitely going to try to get to the bottom of it today. Okay, so third yesterday, I said, then has it gotten any worse? Is it the same? It's getting worse? Yeah. Do you feel like it's all the time or is it on and off? Um, it's just there all the time. Okay. Um, have you ever had any difficulty breathing in the past? Um, no, no, not like this. Okay. Uh, have you, um, have you recently been in contact with anyone that's been sick? Um, I used to know, I don't leave the house much nowadays. I go to the grocery store, I go to the bank, um, just essential things. Okay, have you traveled recently? Um, no, no, I haven't left the city for anything. Okay. Okay. Um, do you know if your immunizations are up to date? Uh, yes, everything's up to date. Okay, that's good. Okay, um, see, so I'm just going to ask you about a few other symptoms. Uh, I just like, you get an idea if there's anything else you've been experiencing. Have you had a cough at all? No. Okay. Have you, um, had a runny nose? No, runny nose. Have you had any headaches? No. Have you had any chest pain? Uh, no, no chest pain. Okay. Have you, um, have you lost any of your sense of smell or taste? Um, maybe taste a little bit but not smell. Okay, okay. Uh, when did that start? The taste, uh, maybe two days ago? Okay. Um, okay, two days ago. Has it been on and off or has it been kind of constantly like a reduced sense taste? Um, it's, it's, it's been pretty constant. Okay. Have you ever had anything like that before? No. Okay. Um, have you had any severs? Um, I don't think so. Okay. Have you had any chills or night sweats? No. Have you felt overall really tired? The week? I have felt tired. Maybe not week but my, I feel like my muscles are all ache. Okay. Okay. And when did that start? Um, that started like immediately after my sore throat. Okay. Okay. Um, let's. Okay. Well, we might circle back to cut if I could get any more questions you want to ask. Um, right now. But just in general, um, in terms of your overall health, do you, um, have any chronic conditions that you take medication for or see a doctor's for regularly? Um, I have mild COPD. Okay. And what medication are you currently taking? Um, I'm on a long acting beta agonist. Okay. Is there still any medication you think? Pardon me. Is that the only medication that you take? Uh, and I also take a couple of vitamins. Okay. Do you have any allergies? Um, no, no allergies. Okay. Is this going to ask you some questions about your lifestyle? You look shorter in town. I do. Okay. Do you, I live alone or with family? Uh, I love alone. Okay. And, uh, do you smoke? I quit two years ago. Oh, congratulations. Uh, before that, did you, um, did you smoke for many years? Uh, I did. I smoked for 40 years. Okay. Uh, do you drink alcohol? Um, I drink occasionally, maybe like on the weekend. Okay. Um, um, do you, do you, cannabis? No. Okay. Any other drugs? Um, no, no other drugs. Okay. Um, indeed, are you retired? Do you work? Um, I'm retired, yeah. Okay, what did you do for work before? Uh, work for GM. Cool. Okay. Um, and do you have any family history of respiratory problems? Heart problems? Yes, there's. No. Okay. Um, okay. I think that's bad about, uh, coverage of my questions for you right now. Is there anything else that you wanted to add that I didn't ask you about? Um, no, I don't think so. Okay. Um, why am I going to go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today? Uh, I'm just in just because some of your symptoms are in line with, uh, common symptoms of COVID-19 that will probably get a COVID swab. Uh, and what happens with that is since you do have the symptoms, you'll have to isolate until the result come back. And, uh, potentially after that, if you still have symptoms, even if it is negative. Uh, so that's just kind of a heads up on that maybe one of the next things that happens. We will probably get you a chest X-ray because we want to get an idea of what's going on in there. Um, did you have any other questions? Um, no, thank you very much. Okay. Well, thanks for chatting with me. We should be back shortly to kind of let you know what the next step is. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you.",
