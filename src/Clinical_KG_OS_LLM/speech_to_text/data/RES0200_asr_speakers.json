  "full_text": " I do for you. Hi, I came in here today. I just was feeling just a bit short of breath over the last few days and I've had a, so I normally have a cough but I've just been coughing a lot more over the last week and I don't know if it's something else. I do have a COPD diagnosis which I was diagnosed with like a couple years ago but this seems to be much worse. Okay. You said you were diagnosed with COPD a couple years ago? Was that two years ago, three years ago? It was almost probably five years ago. Five years ago, okay. And have you always had this cough since then? Yeah, I've probably had a cough for the last ten years I think. Okay. And you mentioned that this cough has gotten worse over the last week? Yeah, I've been coughing a lot more even just walking down the stairs for my bedroom to even the kitchen. I just have to take a little bit of a breather and just start coughing. Okay. And is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any fun? No, I'm bringing up like this. It's usually before this week it was like kind of a clear to yellow, sorry, clear to white material but this past week it's been more yellow and colored. Okay. Any blood in there? No, I'm in no, it's any blood. Okay. And you said you were also short of breath. When did that start? That's just been the last few days. But just to clarify, you get short of breath here and there sometimes I have to use pufferies but the last few days I've just been really short of breath. Even if I walk a little bit after like sit down and can't really catch my breath. Okay. All right. And do you get short of breath when you're laying down? No, not really. It's mainly just when I'm moving around and doing stuff. Okay. How about when you're asleep, does it wake you up and kind of make a guess for air? No. No. Okay. So no orthopnea or PND. All right. So the puffers that you're on, can you remind me which ones you're on again? So I'm on this one called Ventolin for the job in using a lot more recently just for relief. And then I'm on this other puffer. I think it's called Spiriva. Okay. How often, how many times this week have you had to use your Ventolin? I'm, um, Ventolin, I've probably used probably almost like 10 times this past week. Okay. All right. Any chest pain? Um, just when I'm having like those coughing with the breathing, I feel some discomfort, but that's it. Okay. Okay. Um, all right. And then any, um, palpitations are feeling like your heart's racing? Um, nope. Okay. All right. Do you ever feel like your, uh, calves hurt after you walk a while? Um, no, not really. No, okay. Any dizziness or fainting spells? Um, nope. No, no, not that I know. Okay. Numbness or tingling? Uh, nope. Confusion or memory loss? Uh, nope. Head aches. Nope. Change in your bowel movements? Nope. Um, not your vomiting? Uh, nope. Uh, changes in your appetite? No, not really eating about the same. Okay. Changes in your urine? Nope. Uh, running nose or stuffy nose? Um, no, I've even had that. Okay. Surprised? No. Um, changes in your vision or hearing? No. Changes in your smell or taste? No, not really. Okay. Have a, um, weight loss. No, my weight's been in pretty steady. Okay. Uh, chills? Um, maybe a few times this, like, from that last couple days, I've been feeling a bit chilly. Um, but I, I don't know, I have a fever or anything like that. Okay. Um, so you have an actual measure of your temperature, right? No. Okay. We can do that today. Um, any rashes? Uh, nope. Uh, fatigue? Nope. Okay. Um, and besides the COPD, do you have a fever or anything like that? Okay. Um, so you have an actual measure of your temperature, right? No. Okay. We can do that today. Um, any rashes? Uh, nope. Uh, fatigue? What's the COPD? Do you have any other, along standing medical conditions? Um, I, I have, like, a high cholesterol. Okay. And, uh, just, uh, I used to take blood pressure medication, but, uh, I don't right now. Okay. Um, what kind of blood pressure medication should you use to take and? and how can you stop? I was on like a diuretic, and then the doctor said like my blood pressure was really well under control, so I just stopped taking it. Okay, okay. And the doctor was okay with that? No, I just stopped taking it. I didn't really like ask the doctor. Okay, well, we'll keep checking your blood pressure, and that's something you should keep an eye on as well, just in case you have complications with your kidneys. Does that sound okay? Yeah. Okay. And are you on any medications other than the puffers? Just a two-poise study. For your cholesterol, okay. Do you have to date with your immunizations? Yeah. Even a vaccine. Pardon me? I even got the coronavirus vaccine. Okay, good. Congrats. Did you also get the shingles vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine? Yeah, I got the vaccine. Okay, good. Any allergies? No, not that I know. How about family history of lung or heart conditions? My father had lung cancer, but he smoked a lot. I also smoked, so I sometimes worry about that. But all that lung cancer and my mother, she was perfectly healthy. Yeah, so just my father. That's your father. Okay. How much do you smoke? Probably half a pack a day. It used to be one pack, even two packs at one point in time. But right now, it's half a pack a day. Okay. All right. Well, it's good that you're cutting down. And if you need more resources to help you do that, we have some available that we can refer you to. Do you take any other recreational drugs? Cannabis, heroin, cocaine? No, nothing like that. No, I'm okay. And do you drink alcohol? Just probably maybe like a couple of times a month. A couple of times a month. Okay. And are you currently married? Yeah, I currently live with my... Wife? And in other words? Okay. And any reason for you to believe you have old carpets, small dust, asbestos, pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms? No, nothing like that. We live in like a fairly new apartment. Okay. Okay, good. And have you been in contact with any sick people recently? No, not really. We've been just to ourselves. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently? No, just been in our house. Okay. All right. Well, those were all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions of your own? Yeah, I was just wondering what this can be. Yeah, you know, it sounds like you have a cough and churnus of breath. And both of these things you've had for a while, but now they're getting worse. And based on your past history of COPD, I would say this sounds like a COPD exacerbation. So for that, we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC, electrolytes, your kidney function, ABGs, as well as like a chest X-ray. And basically, to treat it, we're going to take your oxygen saturation and give you some extra oxygen if you need it. We'll continue to use your bronchodilators. And in addition to both of that, we'll also give you some steroids, as well as antibiotics, just to prevent any infections or if you already have it, then it can help with that as well. And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those that COVID will also do a COVID swap and make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound? That sounds good. Thank you. Okay, I know. Problem.",
