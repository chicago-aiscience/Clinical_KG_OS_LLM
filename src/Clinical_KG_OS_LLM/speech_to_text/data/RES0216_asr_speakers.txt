[D-1] So, understanding of having some chest tightness?
[P-1] Yeah, it's for the last maybe three days.
[D-2] It's not really pain, not in any specific spot.
[P-2] It just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in, especially.
[D-3] And it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight, like especially when
[P-3] I go for my walks, which I do every day.
[D-4] I try to walk my dog.
[P-4] So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come
[D-5] and get checked out.
[P-5] Okay, for sure.
[D-6] So you said it started about three days ago.
[P-6] Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse, or about staying the same?
[D-7] I think it's staying the same.
[P-7] Okay.
[D-8] Was there anything that happened three days ago that you can recall where you first noticed
[P-8] it?
[D-9] No, nothing in particular.
[P-9] Yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady.
[D-10] Okay.
[P-10] And when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?
[D-11] I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk.
[P-11] Okay.
[D-12] Now, when you were walking, you said you have some chest tightness.
[P-12] Do you have any chest pain?
[D-13] No, there's not pain.
[P-13] It just feels like when I breathe in, it feels tight.
[D-14] Okay.
[P-14] Did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all?
[D-15] Uh, no, I can't say that I did.
[P-15] Nothing like that?
[D-16] Okay.
[P-16] And did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?
[D-17] I feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath.
[P-17] So yeah, yeah, I guess.
[D-18] Okay.
[P-18] And was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?
[D-19] Kind of just all over.
[P-19] Okay.
[D-20] And since then, that happened when you were up for a walk.
[P-20] How many times does it happen a day, would you say?
[D-21] Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk.
[P-21] Um, um, and sometimes it goes for more than one walk, right?
[D-22] So walk my dog.
[P-22] But it's always kind of there.
[D-23] And especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more.
[P-23] Or when I take my big, like a big breath in, as I said.
[D-24] Okay.
[P-24] It's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable if
[D-25] not worse when you're going for a walk.
[P-25] Exactly.
[D-26] Okay.
[P-26] Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?
[D-27] Uh, no.
[P-27] Like I feel a little more horse and like there's maybe some more fun.
[D-28] Like I'm clearing my throat more, but I haven't actually been coughing.
[P-28] Okay.
[D-29] Any fevers?
[P-29] No.
[D-30] I can't say that.
[P-30] No.
[D-31] Okay.
[P-31] Any night sweats?
[D-32] So waking up in the seat sheets are soaked?
[P-32] No.
[D-33] Any chills?
[P-33] No.
[D-34] Any unexplained weight loss at all?
[P-34] Nope.
[D-35] Okay.
[P-35] And have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?
[D-36] Um, I mean, I have asthma.
[P-36] Um, so I've had some trouble breathing before it.
[D-37] This feels, it feels different than other times.
[P-37] I, I guess it could be related, but I don't know.
[D-38] This feels a bit different.
[P-38] That's why I wanted to come in and get a check dough.
[D-39] Okay.
[P-39] So you have asthma.
[D-40] Do you use any puffers at the moment?
[P-40] Yeah.
[D-41] I just use the one that I take every day.
[P-41] I don't really use the, um, the one that's as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time.
[D-42] So I didn't refill my last one.
[P-42] Okay.
[D-43] So you don't have any, any more of the asthma needed, but you have used it in the past.
[P-43] Yeah.
[D-44] Exactly.
[P-44] Like it's been a couple of years since I needed that, but I still, I still take the daily one.
[D-45] Okay.
[P-45] And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in the last three days out there.
[D-46] No, I always take it.
[P-46] Um, so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night.
[D-47] Um, for a while, though, sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it.
[P-47] Um, so, so lately I've been taking it every day, but I've just been taking it in the morning.
[D-48] Okay.
[P-48] And what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night?
[D-49] Have you just been doing well without it?
[P-49] Exactly.
[D-50] Like I haven't needed the, the, the, the, the one in a few years.
[P-50] And even when I was just taking it in the morning, I, I have a problem.
[D-51] Okay.
[P-51] Understood.
[D-52] And then have you had it, I should have asked you work currently.
[P-52] Uh, I, I, I'm a financial advisor.
[D-53] I'm like, semi retired.
[P-53] So I, I do some stuff from home.
[D-54] Okay.
[P-54] Got it.
[D-55] I suppose it does have this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do.
[P-55] I mean, this time from work.
[D-56] I haven't missed any work, but I'm not doing a ton of work right now.
[P-56] I don't think it would stop me.
[D-57] It just would make me uncomfortable.
[P-57] Um, during work and, uh, it keeps me maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of locks a day.
[D-58] The last couple days, I've just gone on one usually.
[P-58] So it's, yeah, it's just a little bit.
[D-59] Yeah.
[P-59] So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day function.
[D-60] I, but it's noticeable.
[P-60] Exactly.
[D-61] Okay.
[P-61] Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?
[D-62] Um, I have a high blood pressure.
[P-62] I don't really see my doctor very much.
[D-63] I just am on medication.
[P-63] Okay.
[D-64] We just talk about your medications a little bit.
[P-64] What are you taking currently?
[D-65] Uh, I take the, uh, cell, cell, butamol.
[P-65] Yeah.
[D-66] That we talked about.
[P-66] And, uh, I take, um, uh, Ramamapro.
[D-67] Yep.
[P-67] And, uh, sometimes I'm a tile and all of us, you know, if I have headache or something, but not very often.
[D-68] Okay.
[P-68] Understood.
[D-69] So aside from the high blood pressure, you're really not taking medications for much else.
[P-69] No, no.
[D-70] Okay.
[P-70] Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?
[D-71] No, nothing major.
[P-71] Just the asthma.
[D-72] But, you know, like I said, it's been a few years since it has bothered me.
[P-72] Okay.
[D-73] Got it.
[P-73] And just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke it all?
[D-74] No.
[P-74] Never.
[D-75] Okay.
[P-75] So no smoking, any other recreational substance in drugs?
[D-76] Oh, no.
[P-76] No, no.
[D-77] I mean, I have, um, you know, a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that.
[P-77] Okay.
[D-78] Got it.
[P-78] Any allergies you have?
[D-79] Um, no, no.
[P-79] Like I, uh, when I was younger, I got some, you know, allergies sometimes in the spring time.
[D-80] But, uh, other than that, I, I look at it.
[P-80] It's really been a many years since I've noticed that.
[D-81] Okay.
[P-81] And so nothing new in the environment.
[D-82] You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog.
[P-82] Exactly.
[D-83] Okay.
[P-83] So it sounds like pretty much saying the course lasts a little while.
[D-84] Just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness.
[P-84] And aside from that, it seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors.
[D-85] But you've kind of been limiting some of the medication you've taken for as in the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much.
[P-85] Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough.
[D-86] Okay.
[P-86] All right, John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the dog and talk about your story.
[D-87] Next, of course, you're going to do a quick physical exam.
[P-87] I'm going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations.
[D-88] I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma, reoccurring in some capacity.
[P-88] Or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings.
[D-89] So I think maybe what we would like to do is we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you hour on walks.
[P-89] And if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next.
[D-90] Does that sound good, John?
[P-90] That sounds great.
[D-91] I'm just glad to know that it's probably not my heart.
[P-91] No, it sounds well. I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise.
[D-92] More sounds like a chest tightness.
[P-92] And you haven't had any pain associated with it.
[D-93] So that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential.
[P-93] But of course, we're going to try one thing at a time and then come back to the table, depending on how you're feeling after that.
[D-94] Okay.
[P-94] Sounds great.
[D-95] Great. Thank you.
[P-95] Okay, I'll go talk to the doctor. I'll be back with you in a moment.
[D-96] Thank you.
