  "full_text": " So what brings you in? Okay, um So I have been coughing a lot over the past week or so and it's been pretty dry, but I've been coughing like almost non-stop throughout the day and I'm feeling very short of breath and I have my bronchodilator helps, but I find I'm using it a lot now Oh, if you know that you have asthma for I was diagnosed when I was eight You're 10 now That's right. So you're using your bronchodilator more. This is the one that you use kind of as needed Yeah, okay, and then do you have one that you take every day no matter what? um No, I don't have that one You just have the one that you take is needed um do you take any other medications? Um, I know I don't take anything else. Oh, okay, just the one is it a it's a puffer? Yes, okay Okay, and uh You're using it more than normal. So how often were you normally using it? Um, I was only using it like I don't know maybe once every two weeks or so not very often um But now I'm using it like I Almost every day like five six times a week Okay, and are you is it usually um turned out that you need it like during certain times like I say when you're exercising or when it's cold Um, I find I use it more both like when it when it's when I'm right after I like run around after jam during recess um and yeah, the cold also makes it worse Okay, and the other triggers that you can think of? Um No, no other triggers Normally uh get more in certain seasons um I don't know no uh big changes there Um, I find the cold air makes it worse like winter makes it worse or like Yeah, maybe also the spring spring with like um pollen and stuff like that Okay, so you have allergies too? Uh, I think so I haven't ever been like formally diagnosed Oh, okay, I see I see yeah, that would make sense. No Okay, uh So you say you've had more coughing lately. Is that right? So the last two weeks Or the last week last two weeks last two Has your cough been a dry cough? Yes, you've been bringing up gum. Okay, dry cough Have you noticed any weezing? Oh Yeah, I've been weezing a lot actually Okay Uh and that's uh Do you use your bronchodiliter every time that you're weezing? When it gets really bad like when I get so weezy that I find it hard to breathe Okay, so you're getting weezy even more times than than you're having to use your bronchodilator Yes, that's right Okay, are you having any symptoms at night time? Yeah They don't happen as much as my daytime symptoms but I have been having it maybe like every other day or like you know every two days or so Okay And uh when you have these so when you have these episodes you're coughing you're weezy do you feel like you're having a hard time breathing? Hmm Yep, that's right Do you feel like it gets tight in your chest? Yes Okay, um, have you had any cold lately or any infections? Um No, no nothing like that Okay, does anyone that lives with you or anyone that you're around often has anyone been sick? No Because you do have been in contact with anyone that's sick? Oh, so you can go to the side of your course? No Okay, have you traveled anywhere? I don't Have you lost any of your sense of taste or smell? No Have you had any fevers? Oh no Okay Any any uh nausea or vomiting? No Any belly pain? No We just asked those questions just because sometimes these things can happen with an infection or after an infection and we just want to make sure um, but that's not you know what's happening right now We probably will do a COVID swab just because of the times that we're living in right now Um, but I just want to ask you a few more questions before I go talk to the doctor um So do you have the size or asthma? Do you have any health problems? Oh, uh, no, no Okay And you said besides the franco dilator you're not taking any medications No And you think you might have allergies in the spring? Do you have allergies to anything else that you know? Uh, no, not that I know of Um Okay Does anyone else in your family have asthma? Um, I think my sister has asthma too Okay Anyone in your family have any other breathing problems? No Okay, anyone else in the family have any allergies? Uh, no, I don't think so Okay Okay um Sounds good And you live at home uh, did you say you live with your parents and your sister? Uh, yep, that's right Well, um, are you currently going to school online or in person? Uh, both we do half days Okay Are you finding that? Uh, it's been okay. It's different, but um, it's been working out okay so far Cool enough to have to get out of your PJs some days Yes, that's true Okay Um, does, uh, do you guys have any pets in the home? Um, no pets we have just like well, I guess we have goldfish Oh, okay Those are cool pets Um, does anyone in the host smoke? No Okay, um, I think that's all my questions that I had for you today Um, what do you feel like you do for fun? Oh um, I like playing games online with my friends and um, before COVID we used to get together and have movie nights and Uh, play sports together That sounds really cool. Well, hopefully um, you can get this figured out for you so you don't have any uh, you know, Have to use your your medications every time you put a sports because that's no fun No, you should be able to enjoy that so So we're gonna try to get this sorted out for you. I'm gonna go talk to the doctor and tell them everything or her everything that you said and You'll come back and see you shortly. Hopefully Maybe all you need is a little change to your medications and maybe we'll be better be able to better control your asthma Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you. Hey, well, thanks for talking with me. We'll see you soon. Okay, great. Thanks",
