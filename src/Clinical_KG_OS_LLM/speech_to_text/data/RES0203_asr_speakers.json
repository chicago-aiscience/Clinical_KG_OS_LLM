  "full_text": " Have you wanted to tell me what grant you in today? Yeah, so for the past two days, I've noticed that I can't smell things as well as I used to be able to smell them. And I seem to have lost my sense of taste as well. And I have this mild dry cough. I'm just worried it's COVID. Okay, you said for a couple days. Yes, for two days. Okay. Okay. Have you ever had anything like this before? No, no, nothing like this. Okay. When you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone? Or if you taste a little bit, or how is that working for you? The smell isn't totally gone. I can still smell something if it smells really, really bad. And then I can taste really, really salty foods, but I can't taste normal things. Like I can't taste the banana. Okay. Has that been pretty consistent throughout the last couple of days? Or is it on and off? It's been pretty consistent, yeah. Okay. Does this dry cough, does that start at the same time? Yes. Okay. And when you say, or sorry, you said mild cough. And my next question was, do you feel like it's a dry cough? Are you producing any fudum, any blood, or is it not bringing up anything? It's dry. Okay. Okay. Has that gotten worse over the last couple of days? The dry cough. It's been pretty consistent as well. Okay. Is there anything to try to make it better? Have you taken any over the counter medications? No, I haven't tried anything. Okay. Okay. Have you had, in addition to these symptoms, have you had any fever? Fever is no fever. Okay. Any difficulty breathing? No. Okay. Any headaches? No, no headaches. Okay. Any sore throat? No. Okay. And we chill their night fun? No. Okay. Any in muscle aches or general weaknesses? I know. Okay. So generally, it seems like it's pretty well other than this loss of case flushed out and the dry cough. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. And then recently, have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick? No. Not that I can remember or... Yeah. Not that I can't remember. Okay. Have you traveled anywhere? I went hiking with my partner two weeks ago. I guess there were some people who kind of brushed by us, but other than that, I don't see where else I could have gotten this from. Okay. Was that hiking somewhere close by? Yeah. It was like half an hour from where we are. Okay. Are immunizations up to date? Yes. Okay. And can you think of any... for this dry cough, just to circle back to that? Can you think of anything that triggers it? Like cold to cold or being around... things like cats or dogs? Or any other environmental thing? No. Okay. Okay. And... Have you had any test pain? That's the other thing. I'm not sure if I asked you. No. No test pain. Okay. Okay. And in terms of your general health, do you... do you have any chronic conditions that you live with? No. No. Okay. Do you take any medications? No. Okay. Have you ever had a surgery or been hospitalized for another reason? No. Okay. Do you have any allergies? No allergies. Okay. Do you have any family history or respiratory problems, or cancers, or heart problems? No. Nothing like that. Okay. And just in terms of your lifestyle, do you live with family? No. Okay. Do you live with a lung, with a partner, or roommate? I live with my parents and my younger siblings. Okay. And then is that in town here? Yes. Okay. And in general, do you eat a healthy diet? Do you exercise? Yeah, I think so. Do you smoke? No. Okay. Do you drink alcohol? No. I have drank alcohol before, but not regularly. Okay. And as you know, on a... I have taken edibles before, but also not regularly. Okay. Any other drugs? No. Okay. Are you currently in high school? Yes. I am in my last year of high school. Okay. Is that going? Pretty good. Yeah. We're doing things online now. Okay. So you haven't really been out of the house? No. Okay. Okay. I think that's all my questions for now. I definitely like to get you a COVID plus. Just to consider your symptoms are consistent with some home and COVID symptoms. So basically that means that we would do a swab. It might not come up for a day or two. You definitely have to self-isolate between now and when you get the results back, potentially even if it's negative longer, if you're still having symptoms. Yeah. Otherwise, there are probably... There might be a couple of other tests we want to do. We made up more questions when we come back. So I'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next. Did you have anything else you want to do, Tom? That I didn't ask you about or any questions. No. Thank you so much. Okay. Well, thanks for coming in today. We'll definitely be taking care of shortly. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.",
