[D-1] what brings you in? Hi, I just came into the I have been having just been feeling really
[P-1] sick over the last three or four days. It started with just like a headache and cough four
[D-2] days ago and then I started getting some nausea and vomiting a few days back as well as diarrhea.
[P-2] Okay, so the headache and cough started first you said right? Yeah. Okay, let's talk about the
[D-3] headache first. That came on four days ago. Has it been persistent or does it come and go?
[P-3] It's been pretty persistent besides when I take some Tylenol. Okay, and does anything make it better or
[D-4] worse? Just the Tylenol, nothing really, yeah, it's pretty constant. Okay, and have a, and sorry,
[P-4] where exactly is it? Is it on, is it like at the top of your head, temples, forehead? It's kind of
[D-5] like my forehead and the top of my head on both sides. Okay, and does it radiate to your neck or
[P-5] anywhere else? No, I think it's, it doesn't go to my neck or anywhere else. Okay, and do you have
[D-6] neck stiffness or neck pain with that? No, not really. And one to ten, ten being the worst thing
[P-6] you've ever had, how bad is it? The headache probably like seven. Okay, and timeline wise has
[D-7] it gotten worse over the past four days? It's kind of stayed around the same actually. Okay, okay,
[P-7] and have you ever had a headache like this at the past? Not really, I don't really get too many headaches.
[D-8] Okay, so this isn't you. All right, and let's go on to the cough. The cough started around the same
[P-8] time you said it. Has that gotten better or worse over the past four days? It's, the cough is
[D-9] around the same as well. Okay, and is it a dry cough or are you breaking up any flim?

[P-20] Okay, and um, are you throwing up any blood?
[D-21] No. What color is it?
[P-21] Um, it's usually I feel like whatever I ate.
[D-22] Okay. Yeah, contents, food contents.
[P-22] Okay. Um, do you think anything triggered that episode of vomiting?
[D-23] No, I haven't really ate anything new. Um, just in my house, I, yeah, I don't know what triggered it.
[P-23] Okay. All right. Um, any feelings of like, um, feeling like you're bloated or gassy?
[D-24] Um, no, nothing like that. Okay. Any constipation?
[P-24] No. Okay. All right. And are you otherwise healthy or do you have any long standing medical conditions?
[D-25] No, I'm pretty healthy. I don't really, I don't really even take any medications.
[P-25] Okay. And um, are you up to date with your immunizations?
[D-26] Yep. Um, do you have any allergies?
[P-26] Uh, no, not that I know them.

[D-28] Okay. Do you smoke?
[P-28] Nope.
[D-29] No, okay. Um, have a marijuana or, uh,
[P-29] yeah, have a marijuana. Do you either take edibles or smoke it?
[D-30] Uh, I've tried a couple times, but uh, it was not really my thing.
[P-30] Okay. Um, have other recreational drugs like cocaine, heroin, opioid?
[D-31] No, nothing like that.
[P-31] Okay. Um, and where do you currently live?
[D-32] Um, I live, um, just, uh, in an apartment, uh, just in the city. Um, so, yeah, just by myself though.
[P-32] Okay. Um, any, uh, like old carpets, does, mold,
[D-33] does bestest pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms?
[P-33] No, not really.
[D-34] Okay. And have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?
[P-34] No, I've been, um, kind of at home, um, the only places I maybe have been in contact with someone
[D-35] is maybe at work, um, in like the lunchroom and things like that.
[P-35] Okay. Okay. And sorry, where do you work?
[D-36] Uh, I work at a car dealership.
[P-36] Okay. Okay. Um, any travel recently?
[D-37] No. Okay. Has anyone at your work been sick as well?
[P-37] No, I haven't really noticed anyone being sick.
[D-38] Okay. Okay. Well, those were the questions that I had for you.
[P-38] Did you have any questions of your own for me?
[D-39] Um, no, I, I was just wondering what this can be.
[P-39] Um, yeah. So the first thing we want to rule out is COVID because, um,
[D-40] a lot of your symptoms overlap, but those have COVID.
[P-40] So we'll take a swab and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours.
[D-41] And the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days.
[P-41] Um, and, um, if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some
[D-42] contact tracing. Um, but if it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around
[P-42] this time of year. Um, that could be causing similar symptoms as well.
[D-43] But, uh, either way, the management kind of is supportive.
[P-43] So making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well,
[D-44] taking antipyritic, like Tylenol for fever, if you get any.
[P-44] And, uh, you can also take, um, Tylenol or NSAIDs for, um,
[D-45] muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Um, does that sound okay?
[P-45] Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. Okay. Great. No problem.
