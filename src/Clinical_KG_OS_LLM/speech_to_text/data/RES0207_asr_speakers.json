Okay, this morning suddenly feeling short of breath. Yeah, this cough was that also something that happened suddenly this morning? Yeah. Okay, so you ever had anything like this before? No, not, I mean, I get it cough from time to time when I get sick but I've never really felt short of breath. Okay, is this cough a dry cough or are you bringing up any sputum? It's a dry cough. Okay. Have you had any fever? Yeah, I checked it this morning. I was like, it was kind of a mild so 37.4 I think. Okay. Is that just this morning? Yeah. Okay. Have you had any chest pain? No. Have you felt that all if you were going to faint? No, no. Although I should let you know and maybe I don't know if it's related but I had a seizure last night. And I was fine after and then I went to bed. I don't know if that's related but I thought I should let you know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you for sharing that with me. Have you ever had any issues like this following seizures in the past? No. I usually don't get seizures very often. I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have, yeah. No worries. Is there anything in terms of this shortness of breath and this cough? Is there anything that makes it feel worse? I... In any position. Yeah. I mean, I haven't really been in a lot of positions. I mean, I just started three hours ago or so. I've had a hard question. Yeah, I haven't done it since then. Have you had any nausea or vomiting? No. Any belly pain? I know. Okay. Any diarrhea? No, I don't. Okay. Have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick lately? No, I haven't. Um. Okay. Have you traveled anywhere? No, I've just been at home. Okay. Okay.

Have any no-ples? Nope. Okay. Um. So in terms of your overall health, you said that you have S-L-F-C. Um. Do you have any other chronic conditions that you've been diagnosed with? No, that's it. Okay. You said you take a medication. What medication or medications are you currently taking? Um, I'm taking Kepra. And, uh, normally, um, are you having any difficulty remembering taking it or was it just kind of a brain fart? No, it just kind of happened. It was, uh, it was, uh, my daughter's birthday and we kind of just, I usually sort of have it, uh, with dinner time, but we did things a little bit differently and, uh, have like a celebration earlier on. And so I completely forgot because I didn't have dinner later. Oh, yeah. That makes sense. Um, it happens, for sure. Um, okay. Do you have any allergies? No. Um, do you have any, uh, family history? Any, um, any diseases that run in your family? Yeah, um, epilepsy, uh, runs into family. My mom had it. Oh, okay. Um, okay. And in terms of real lifestyle, you said that, uh, you have a daughter.

Um, on the weekends, one or two class as a wine. Okay. And, uh, do you use any other substances? No, I don't. Okay. I think that about covers my questions for now. Um, so I'm going to take everything we talked about. I'm going to go over it with the doctor this working today. And now we'll come back partly and talk to you about the next steps. If there's any tests we want to do or, um, how we want to move forward with this. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Okay. Sure. You should hardly.",
