  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer diagnoses anxiety-related/stress-induced chest pain; Generated matches with 'Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain'. Core supports align: situational pattern (partial citations), history of anxiety (misattributed to P-20 instead of P-21/P-22, but concept correct), current stress (partial), breathing/nervousness (close), patient considers stress. Misses pertinent negatives entirely. Minor phrasing issues (e.g., breathing difficulty overstated). Overall, minor discrepancies, core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1. Situational pattern [P-4,P-9,P-29] - covered partially [P-29]; 2. Anxiety history [P-21,P-22] - covered but wrong cite; 3. Thesis stress [P-13,P-15,P-16] - partial [P-13]; 4. Nervousness/breathing [P-19] - covered; 5. Patient considers stress [P-8] - covered; 6. Pertinent negatives - completely missed. Covers ~80% of points, with some partial.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable except: history-pain link via P-20 (P-20 is about palpitations, not pain - hallucinated connection); minor stretch on 'hard time breathing' (transcript clarifies 'not hard otherwise'). Citations accurate otherwise; psychosomatic mechanism interpretive but plausible. Mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly states diagnosis and lists supporting observations with transcript citations, perfectly matching question's request for diagnosis and specific clinical supports. No tangents."
