  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is fully consistent with the Gold Answer. Both identify COVID-19 as the condition to be ruled out, correctly cite the swab test ordered, the 48-hour turnaround time, and the isolation instructions. The citations [P-1], [D-39] match between both answers. No factual errors or contradictions exist.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all four key points required by the question: (1) the condition (COVID-19), (2) the specific test (swab), (3) the turnaround time (48 hours), and (4) the isolation instructions. It also includes appropriate context about the patient's initial concern and the pandemic setting. The Gold Answer's additional detail about 'further instructions from public health' is mentioned but not emphasized in the Generated Answer, representing a very minor omission that doesn't affect the core completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript. The COVID-19 concern is documented in [P-1], the swab test and 48-hour timeline are in [D-39], and isolation instructions are explicitly stated in [D-39]. The citations are accurate and all statements are grounded in the source material with no hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and precisely addresses all four parts of the question without extraneous information. The response is well-organized with bullet points for each component of the question, making it highly focused and relevant. No off-topic content is present."
