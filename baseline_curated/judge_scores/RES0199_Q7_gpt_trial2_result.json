  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies headache and cough as the initial symptoms starting ~4 days prior (consistent with P-1/P-2). It correctly states loss of smell began ~1 day prior (P-24). It states GI symptoms began “a few days back,” which is broadly consistent with P-1, but it fails to capture the more specific timeline (diarrhea ~2 days ago; vomiting yesterday; nausea today). It does not explicitly state that headache severity and cough stayed about the same over the four days (P-9, P-11), but it also does not claim they worsened—so this is mainly an omission rather than a direct error.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) first symptoms were headache + cough at day 4; (2) GI symptoms started after initial symptoms (quoted as “few days back”); (3) smell loss began 1 day ago; (4) headache persistent; cough dry. \nKey points missed from Gold Answer: (1) diarrhea specifically began ~2 days ago with frequency 5–6/day; (2) vomiting occurred the day before the visit (2 episodes) and nausea persisted on visit day; (3) explicit statement that headache severity stayed the same over 4 days and cough also remained “around the same”; (4) headache rated 7/10 and location details were only partially used; (5) explicit relative sequencing (GI about 2 days after onset, anosmia latest).",
    "faithfulness": "Statements made are supported by the transcript: onset timing (P-1), GI symptoms being present “few days back” (P-1), loss of smell over 1 day (P-24), persistent headache (P-3) and dry cough (P-12). No clear hallucinated details are introduced; the main issue is lack of specificity rather than unsupported claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the asked illness progression (initial symptoms, GI timing, smell loss timing, and headache/cough course). However, it incompletely addresses the question’s request about how headache and cough changed/remained stable in severity over time (it omits the explicit ‘stayed the same’ information)."
