  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains all factually correct information consistent with the Gold Answer. The timeline (two weeks, flu-like symptoms initially, first 2-3 days sore throat, 3-4 days other symptoms resolved, 4-5 days mucus production, transition to dry cough) matches the Gold Answer. The description of mucus as 'whitish clear' is accurate. However, the Generated Answer omits the specific mention of sore throat resolving after 2-3 days and runny nose as specific symptoms, though it captures the general 'flu-like symptoms' resolution.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses several specific details from the Gold Answer: (1) explicit mention of sore throat in first 2-3 days, (2) explicit mention of runny nose, (3) cough intensity remaining 'kind of the same', (4) frequency remaining stable at 3-4 times per hour, (5) cough being spontaneous with no identifiable triggers, (6) no fevers at any point, (7) COVID test being negative at symptom onset, (8) patient being home awaiting resolution before returning to work. The answer captures approximately 60-70% of the key timeline details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer correctly references P-2, P-14, P-6, P-5, and P-15. There are no hallucinated facts. The answer appropriately uses bracket citations to ground statements in the source material. The description of 'whitish clear kind of mucus' is quoted directly from P-6.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about symptom progression timeline. It covers when initial symptoms appeared, mucus production duration and appearance, transition from productive to dry cough, and when other symptoms resolved. However, it provides less detail about cough intensity and frequency changes over time compared to what was asked. The answer stays focused on the timeline without tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate timeline of symptom progression with proper citations and no hallucinations. It correctly describes the two-week duration, initial flu-like symptoms, 4-5 days of whitish clear mucus production, transition to dry cough, and resolution of other symptoms within 3-4 days. However, it omits several specific details present in the Gold Answer including: explicit mention of sore throat and runny nose, cough intensity remaining constant, frequency of 3-4 times per hour, spontaneous nature with no triggers, absence of fever, and COVID test results. The answer is well-structured and relevant but could be more complete in covering all aspects of the question, particularly regarding cough intensity and frequency changes."
