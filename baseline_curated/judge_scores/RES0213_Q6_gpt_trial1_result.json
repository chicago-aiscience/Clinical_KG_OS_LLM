  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect about the doctor’s concluding remarks/plan: the transcript clearly includes a closing plan in [D-33] (“I’ll pass it on to the doctor who’ll take a look at you”), but the Generated Answer states the closing/plan is not included. That is a major contradiction of the source and Gold Answer. Some clinical details it lists are broadly correct (pleuritic quality with deep breath [P-3], anxiety-related faster breathing [P-19], father had MI [P-8]), but it also introduces inaccuracies/overstatements (e.g., implies palpitations are simply absent; transcript says no flutter except during anxiety [P-20]).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements missing or insufficiently covered include: duration (1.5 weeks), episodic pattern (~20 min episodes), not worse with exercise, relief with distraction, failed OTC meds (Tylenol/Advil/Alka-Seltzer), multiple pertinent negatives (no trauma, no fevers, no asthma, no baseline dyspnea, no sudden death/arrhythmias in family), smoking quantities (5/day down from 10/day), lack of regular meds except multivitamin, and living alone. It includes only a subset: chest pain with deep breath, stress context, smoking attempt, anxiety history, father’s MI, and situational triggers. Overall coverage is well under ~50% of the Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “knowledge graph” and claims attributed to [KG] are unsupported by the provided source. It also incorrectly states the excerpt ends at [P-29] without a doctor closing, despite [D-33] being present. These issues reduce faithfulness substantially, even though some symptom/history statements are verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (plan + key clinical information), but it fails to provide the actual stated plan and instead claims it is missing, which undermines answering the main question. The remainder summarizes some gathered history that is relevant, with minor extraneous content (knowledge-graph framing)."
