  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the attachment duration reasoning, matching the Gold Answer's coverage of Friday hiking, Saturday gardening [P-1], uncertainty in attachment time, discovery 'earlier today' [D-1], doctor's confirmation of time since last outdoors [D-2], and estimation of >72 hours leading to prophylactic antibiotics [D-6]. However, it incorrectly claims the Strathroy Lyme disease map detail 'is **not present**' in the transcript, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [D-13], where the doctor explicitly references the Ontario Lyme map and states 'Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point' to justify antibiotics. It also misattributes justification to prior rash [P-3] instead of location. This introduces significant contradictions on the second half of the question.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points on attachment duration (hiking/gardening activities [P-1], doctor's >72-hour calculation [D-6], link to prophylactic treatment). Misses entirely the geographic risk points: Strathroy location [P-12], doctor's map reference and assessment as 'concerning' [D-13], and how it contributes to antibiotic decision. Covers ~50% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Duration claims fully verifiable [P-1, D-2, D-6]. Geographic claims hallucinate absence of map/Strathroy detail despite clear presence in [D-13]; falsely attributes reliance to prior rash [P-3, D-6] which is not the doctor's stated justification for this incident's prophylaxis. Multiple ungrounded assertions about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question: explains duration contribution from activities and doctor's reasoning; responds to map usage by denying its presence and offering alternative justification. No off-topic content, remains focused on question elements despite errors."
