  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main risk factors (hereditary predisposition via mother's epilepsy [P-26] and medication non-adherence with missed Keppra dose [P-9, P-23]) matching the Gold Answer's core facts. It also addresses the family history's relation to the diagnosis as predisposing. No direct contradictions, but adds unsubstantiated 'knowledge graph' references and stronger causality ('directly causative') compared to Gold's 'likely precipitated' and patient-attributed phrasing; these are minor discrepancies while core facts align. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) hereditary risk (epilepsy runs in family, mom had it [P-26]); (2) clinician's family history question [D-26]; (3) consistent with patient's epilepsy [P-8]; (4) medication (Keppra [P-23]); (5) missed due to daughter's birthday [P-24]; (6) patient links to seizure [P-9]; (7) seizures infrequent when adherent [P-9]; (8) combination of factors. Generated covers (1), (4), (6), and relation to diagnosis; misses (2), (3), (5), (7), (8). Covers ~60-70% of key points. Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Citations [P-9, P-23, P-26] are accurate and verifiable in transcript. Patient's epilepsy [P-8] implied but not cited. However, 'knowledge graph' mentioned twice as source for causality is entirely absent from transcript (hallucinated external reference). Claims like 'directly causative' and 'causal link' are plausible interpretations but attributed to fabricated 'knowledge graph'; 'not incidental finding' is added interpretation. Multiple hallucinated elements. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Answer is structured around the question's elements (hereditary/medication risks, family history relation to diagnosis) with clear sections; directly addresses without off-topic content despite minor extraneous 'knowledge graph' additions. Score: 5."
