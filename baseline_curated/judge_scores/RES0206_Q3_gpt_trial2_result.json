  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key symptoms supporting COPD exacerbation (worsened dyspnea, increased cough, increased sputum production) and respiratory infection (subjective fever, sick contact, purulent/green-yellow sputum), consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. However, it adds interpretive claims not supported by the transcript or Gold Answer (e.g., “incubation and progression typical of an infection,” and that infection has “moved into the airways, physically obstructing them”), and it references a “knowledge graph” statement that is not part of the provided transcript/Gold Answer. These are not direct contradictions but are unsupported embellishments.",
    "completeness": "Covered key Gold points: increased cough, increased sputum/purulence (green-yellow), worsened dyspnea, subjective fever, sick contact, acute 3-day course (mentioned in transcript though not a main Gold distinguishing point). Missed several Gold Answer supporting details for infection: sinus pressure and mild headache. Missed an important COPD exacerbation feature emphasized in Gold: decreased exercise tolerance/difficulty with usual walks. Also omitted contextual/exclusionary elements from Gold (no dust/smoke exposure, maintenance inhaler adherence, prior pattern of COPD worsened by illness, and the note that no objective exam/labs are yet available). Overall coverage is partial (~60–75% of Gold’s key elements).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (feverish feeling, sick contact, worsening dyspnea, cough, green-yellow sputum). But multiple claims are not verifiable from the transcript (infection incubation framing; airway obstruction mechanism; “according to the knowledge graph, green sputum indicates both…”). These constitute notable ungrounded additions, though the core symptom reporting remains faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked comparison: which symptoms support dual assessment (infection + COPD exacerbation) and how green-yellow sputum and fever help distinguish an infectious trigger versus COPD baseline/exacerbation. Minimal irrelevant content aside from the unnecessary “knowledge graph” reference."
