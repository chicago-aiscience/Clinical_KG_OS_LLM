{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer on all core factual elements: working diagnosis as a viral infection/common cold; supportive care (hydrate, OTC Tylenol Cold); COVID swab ordered today with results in ~48 hours; isolate at home and avoid others while awaiting results; follow further public health instructions after results. No contradictory or incorrect statements are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Covers the diagnosis, both supportive-care items, the COVID swab with timing/result window, and the public health isolation/follow-up guidance. It omits two elements present in the Gold Answer: (1) expectation-setting that symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve, and (2) the explicit statement that there is not much beyond supportive care for a viral infection. Thus it is mostly complete but not fully.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by [D-39]. No hallucinated symptoms, treatments, or guidance appear beyond the transcript (e.g., it correctly avoids adding antibiotics or additional meds).",
    "relevance": "The response stays tightly focused on the requested components of the end-of-visit management plan (diagnosis, supportive care, test ordered, and public health guidance) with no meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "Accurate, transcript-grounded, and highly relevant, but slightly incomplete because it omits the doctor’s expectation-setting that recovery may take a few weeks and that little beyond supportive care is available."
