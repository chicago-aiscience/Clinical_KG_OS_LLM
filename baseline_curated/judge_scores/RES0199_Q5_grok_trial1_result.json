  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor 'did not systematically explore' the patient's living situation, workplace environment, travel history, or contact with sick individuals, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence (e.g., [D-45] living situation, [D-46] environmental triggers, [D-47] sick contacts, [D-48] workplace, [D-49] travel, [D-50] sick at work). It misrepresents the focus of the consultation and ignores key inquiries, leading to factual contradictions on all major points.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: living situation [P-45], environmental triggers [D-46/P-46], sick contacts [D-47/P-47], workplace [P-48/D-50/P-50], travel [D-49/P-49], substance use screening [D-42-44], conclusion of no clear source. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead fabricating a denial of all explorations and focusing on symptoms/COVID suspicion.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that no inquiries were made into exposures despite clear transcript evidence ([D-45] to [D-50]); it falsely claims only smoking was probed ([D-42]), ignores environmental/home questions, misinterprets contact tracing [D-52] as absence of history-taking, and fabricates that consultation avoided exposure sources—largely ungrounded and contradictory to transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly responds to the question by asserting no systematic exploration of the specified areas (living, workplace, travel, contacts), staying focused without major tangents, though factually erroneous."
