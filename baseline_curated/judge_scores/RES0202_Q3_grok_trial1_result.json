  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key symptoms (dry cough worsening over days, fever ~100-101°F, possible loss of taste) and doctor's statements from D-44 and D-45 matching the Gold Answer. Core facts are consistent, including the triad and reasoning for infection over asthma due to fever. Minor discrepancies arise from added references to a 'knowledge graph,' 'KG,' 'LAB_RESULT,' and 'SYMPTOM,' which are not in the Gold Answer or transcript but do not contradict core facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: triad of symptoms with accurate citations (dry cough [P-1,P-5,P-12], fever [P-1,P-2], taste change [P-17]); alignment with COVID [D-44]; fever distinguishing infection from asthma [D-45]. Systemic aspects like fatigue/decreased appetite implied but not fully listed; acute onset noted indirectly. Covers ~95% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about symptoms, citations (P-1,P-2,P-5,P-12,P-17,D-44,D-45), and doctor's quotes are verifiable in transcript. However, multiple hallucinations: 'knowledge graph,' 'KG,' 'LAB_RESULT,' 'SYMPTOM' are fabricated and not in transcript, introducing unverifiable external details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the specified symptoms (respiratory complaint, temperature, taste change), their role in COVID alignment, and collective use for infectious conclusion, with no off-topic content."
