  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer, including the two inhalers (daily maintenance and rescue used ~once every two weeks), no antihypertensive medications, and the patient's choice of lifestyle modifications first with BP currently OK. Minor discrepancies include incorrect citation [P-1] for inhaler details (should be [P-26]), inferring 'dietary adjustments' (not explicit, though weight loss is mentioned), and specifying 'walking dogs with friends' (partial match to personal walking). No major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: two inhalers with frequencies [P-26], no antihypertensive meds, reason (lifestyle first [P-23]), BP OK [P-23], lifestyle changes including walking. Missed: no home oxygen [P-1], doctor's support for lifestyle [D-25], quit smoking as key COPD strategy [P-40], baseline COPD well-managed [P-28], rare alcohol [P-39], no medication allergies [P-29/30]. Covers ~60-70% of Gold's key points, focusing on question cores but omitting several management strategies.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims grounded: inhalers and frequencies in [P-26], HTN details in [P-22/23], lifestyle changes in [P-23/24], exacerbation in [P-1]. Minor issues: [P-1] citation inaccurate for inhaler types/freq; 'dietary adjustments' plausible from weight loss [P-24] but not verbatim; walking with friends [P-20] slightly stretched from personal dog walking [P-4]. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around COPD meds/strategies/frequencies and HTN management/reason for no meds; minor exacerbation context directly supports current status. No off-topic content."
