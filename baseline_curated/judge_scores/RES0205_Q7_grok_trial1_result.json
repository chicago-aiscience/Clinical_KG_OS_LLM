  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports all facts it mentions, such as the two-week duration of cough [P-2], initial flu-like symptoms for the first couple of days resolving in 3-4 days [P-14], whitish clear mucus for first 4-5 days [P-6], transition to dry cough after [P-5, P-6], and chest soreness from coughing [P-15]. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covered: onset two weeks ago with flu-like symptoms [P-14/P-2], resolution of non-cough flu symptoms in first 3-4 days [P-14], mucus production duration (4-5 days) and appearance (whitish clear) [P-6], transition to dry cough after 4-5 days [P-5/P-6], persistence of dry cough as main symptom, chest soreness [P-15]. Missed: specific first 2-3 days sore throat and its resolution [P-13], runny nose detail [P-14], cough intensity remained the same [P-7], frequency stable at 3-4 times/hour spontaneous [P-8/P-9/P-10], no fevers [P-12], COVID test negative at onset and staying home [P-35/P-36]. Covers 50-79% of Gold key points, especially missing cough intensity/frequency changes explicitly requested.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: cough duration [P-2], flu-like initial [P-14], resolution [P-14], mucus details [P-6], dry transition [P-5/P-6], soreness [P-15]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured as a timeline directly addressing symptom progression, onset, mucus, transition, resolution of other symptoms, and persistence, perfectly matching the question with no irrelevant content."
