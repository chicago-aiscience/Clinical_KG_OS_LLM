{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all elements asked in the question: (1) the condition to rule out is COVID-19, (2) the ordered diagnostic test is a swab, (3) expected turnaround time is 24–48 hours, and (4) if negative, the alternative diagnosis considered is another viral illness. No contradictions with the Gold Answer are present. The added mention of a “knowledge graph” does not change the clinical facts, but it is extraneous.",
    "completeness": "All key components from the Gold Answer that are directly responsive to the question are included: COVID-19 to rule out, swab test, 24–48 hour turnaround, and alternative of another viral illness if negative. The Gold Answer also mentions isolation for 14 days and contact tracing if positive, but these were not asked in the question; their omission does not materially reduce completeness for this specific prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims are grounded in the transcript (D-52): COVID concern, swab, 24–48 hours, and alternative viral illness. However, references to a “knowledge graph” and the specific KG-cited treatment linkage are not part of the transcript (even though hydration/supportive care is mentioned in D-52). This introduces minor unverifiable/external framing, so it is mostly but not perfectly grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers what was asked (rule-out condition, test + turnaround time, alternative diagnosis if negative) and does not go on tangents, aside from brief unnecessary ‘knowledge graph’ framing."
