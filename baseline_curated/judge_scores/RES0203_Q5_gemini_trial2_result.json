  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the hiking trip two weeks ago and the brushing against people as the exposure event. However, it introduces a 'Knowledge Graph Link' which is not a fact present in the transcript or the gold answer, though the logic it represents (exposure leads to diagnosis) is clinically sound. The second point regarding symptom consistency is accurate to the transcript [P-1, D-39].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key contextual points from the gold answer that justify why the hiking trip is significant. It omits the patient's status as a high school senior [P-36], the online classes [P-37], and the fact that they have mostly stayed at home [P-38], which explains why this specific event is the only identified potential exposure. It also misses the detail that the hike was 30 minutes away [P-19].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinations a 'Knowledge Graph' structure and specific metadata tags (e.g., [MEDICAL_HISTORY]) which are not in the source transcript. While the clinical content (hiking and symptoms) is grounded in the text, the attribution to a Knowledge Graph is an external fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses both parts of the question: identifying the exposure event and attempting to explain the connection to the COVID-19 diagnosis."
