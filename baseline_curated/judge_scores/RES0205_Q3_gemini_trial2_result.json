{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and the negative result. However, it states the cough 'worsened into a dry cough', which contradicts the transcript where the patient says the intensity stayed 'Kind of the same' [P-7]. The Gold Answer focuses on the 'persistent nature' rather than a worsening intensity.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points: COVID-19 diagnosis, hospital worker status, persistent cough, resolution of other flu symptoms, coworker fear, and the negative result. It misses specific details found in the Gold Answer, such as the patient's job title (clerk), specific symptoms like sore throat and runny nose, the mention of PPE, the specific timing of the test (2 weeks ago), and the fact that the patient has been staying home since testing.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is mostly grounded in the transcript. The claim that the cough 'worsened' is a minor hallucination/misinterpretation of the patient's statement that intensity was the same [P-7]. Citations for other claims are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the question: the diagnosis, the evidence for investigation, and the results."
