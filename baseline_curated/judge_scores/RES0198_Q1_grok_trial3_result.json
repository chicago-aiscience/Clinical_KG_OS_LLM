  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies nasal congestion ('stuffy nose') and rhinorrhea ('runny nose') from [P-1] and [P-10], aligning partially with Gold. However, it incorrectly states there is no description of nasal discharge character, contradicting [P-5] ('mostly clear') and Gold. It also wrongly claims no explicit denials of related symptoms (e.g., cough [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat/fevers [P-7], loss of taste/smell [P-16]), which are central to Gold and transcript, introducing significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: stuffy nose/congestion, runny nose (partial, misses 'on and off,' 1-week duration details, evolution from stuffy to running [P-2,P-3]). Missed entirely: clear discharge [P-5]; all explicit denials (cough [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills [P-7], loss of taste/smell [P-16]); mild fatigue [P-15]; other negatives. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Nasal symptoms verifiable in [P-1,P-10]. Discharge claim ('no description') hallucinates absence despite direct [D-5/P-5] 'mostly clear.' Denial claim ('no evidence') fabricates absences contradicting explicit transcript denials [P-4,P-6,P-7,P-16]; irrelevant citations to [P-11,P-23] (living/diabetes) add ungrounded content. Multiple hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the question's three parts (nasal symptoms, discharge character, related symptom denials) with no off-topic content or tangents, perfectly focused."
