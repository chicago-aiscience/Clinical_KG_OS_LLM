  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the logic used to estimate the tick attachment duration (Friday/Saturday activities leading to a >72-hour estimate). however, it fails significantly on the second part of the question. It explicitly states that the detail about Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map is 'not present' in the transcript, which is incorrect. This information is clearly stated in [D-13].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first half of the question (attachment duration) well, but completely misses the second half (geographic risk) by denying its existence in the text. This results in roughly 50% coverage of the required key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a 'hallucination of absence.' It claims the information regarding the distribution map is not in the transcript, while turn [D-13] explicitly mentions the map and Strathroy's status as a 'concerning point.'",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the first part of the question. For the second part, it addresses the prompt but provides a false negative response instead of the requested information."
