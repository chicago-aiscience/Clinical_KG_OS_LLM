  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies the ruled-out condition as COVID-19 and cites the patient’s statement about having a COVID test and not having COVID ([P-35]).\n- Correctly identifies the test as a “covid test.”\n- Incorrect on timing: the Generated Answer claims the transcript does not explicitly state when the test occurred relative to symptom onset, but the patient clearly states: “I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago” ([P-36]).\n- Workplace concerns are partially correct (coworkers being scared), but it omits other accurate occupational context that makes the exclusion important (hospital job, infection control context, staying home/return-to-work concern).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points vs Generated Answer:\n- ✅ Condition ruled out: COVID-19.\n- ✅ Test used: COVID test.\n- ❌ Timing relative to onset: missing/incorrect (should be at symptom onset ~2 weeks prior).\n- ⚠️ Workplace-related concerns: partially covered.\n  - ✅ Coworkers scared when patient coughs.\n  - ❌ Works at hospital (clerk) explicitly.\n  - ❌ Wearing PPE at work.\n  - ❌ Stayed home awaiting improvement and wants to return but not cough.\nOverall, it captures ~2 of the 5 major elements and misses several workplace-context details emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are grounded in the transcript (COVID test, coworkers scared at work, 2-week cough duration).\n- However, it introduces an ungrounded element (“knowledge graph [PROCEDURE]”) not present in the transcript.\n- It also makes a demonstrably incorrect claim about the transcript not stating timing, despite [P-36] explicitly providing it. This reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "- Directly addresses the asked items (condition, test, timing, workplace concerns) and stays on-topic.\n- The main deficiency is omission/incorrectness, not irrelevance."
