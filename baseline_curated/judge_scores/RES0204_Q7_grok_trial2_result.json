  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely factually accurate compared to the Gold Answer: correctly identifies cough onset at 4-5 days [P-2], runny nose 'past couple of days' [P-11] about 2-3 days later, dry nature implied, and persistence/not improving [P-2]. Severity described as 'consistent' aligns with Gold's 'stayed the same' [P-7] indirectly. However, minor discrepancies include calling duration 'past week' (actually 4-5 days), not explicitly noting non-productive ('no gunk' [P-6]), and a stretched interpretation of fever history from P-13 as 'previous episodes' with fevers tied to similar symptoms (Gold focuses on P-24 specifics). Core facts match.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: cough 4-5 days first (yes), dry (yes), non-productive (missed explicit), severity stayed same/not better (inferred via P-2, partial), runny nose later/clear (yes), progressive pattern (yes). Missed: explicit prior healthy status, 'never had dry cough like this', past runny noses 'never lasted this long' [P-24], novel acute event emphasis; instead adds fever/asthma comparisons not central to Gold's prior symptom focus. Covers ~70% of keys.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: timelines [P-2,P-11], persistence [P-2], asthma eval [P-28]. Citations accurate. Minor issues: 'past week' stretches 4-5 days; fever comparison to 'previous episodes' [P-13] plausible (mom notes past fevers) but not explicitly similar symptoms/transcript doesn't detail prior episodes matching current; no major hallucinations, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question elements: symptom development timeline, cough vs runny timing/duration, severity changes (none), prior comparisons. Minor tangent on fever/asthma still pertinent to history/context, no off-topic content."
