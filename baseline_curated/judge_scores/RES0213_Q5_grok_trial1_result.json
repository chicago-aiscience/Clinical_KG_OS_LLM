  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately summarizes family history (father's HA in 50s last year, scares her [P-8, P-30], grandpa accident [P-30]), smoking (started ~18, peaked 10/day for 2 years, now ~5/day, hard to quit [P-13,14,18]), stressors (Masters thesis pressure [P-15,16], living alone [P-26,27], nervous about running [P-28]), and connections (stress-related? but worried heart [P-8], nervous breathing [P-19], past anxiety [P-22]). Generated Answer matches core facts on family (dad HA 50s [P-8]), smoking (trying to quit, hard, prior 10/day now less [P-13]), stressors (thesis/school stress, alone studying/walking [P-29], anxiety breathing [P-19]). Minor discrepancies: phrases smoking as not 'current active' (she reports 5/day currently), omits grandpa/living alone/running details, adds interpretive 'cycle of anxiety'; hallucinates 'knowledge graph' and 'diagnosis' not in Gold/transcript. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: family details/cites (covered mostly, misses grandpa [P-30]); smoking details/cites (covered well); stressors specifics (covers thesis pressure, misses living alone [P-26,27], nervous running [P-28]); connections (covers stress/heart worry [P-8], breathing/anxiety [P-19], adds anxiety attacks but misses past history [P-22] explicitly). Covers contributions/interactions/illustrations for all three factors with transcript details; ~85% of key points (strong on main factors, misses some sub-details).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: family worry [P-8], smoking struggle [P-13], stress triggers [P-29], breathing [P-19], pain on breath [P-3]. Citations accurate where used. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph' mentions (twice, linking to diagnosis/symptoms - absent from transcript); 'hyperventilation' (plausible from 'breathing faster' [P-19]); 'subconsciously increase fear' (interpretation). Multiple fabricated elements (KG) but core content grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three specified factors (family, smoking, stressors), their contributions to heart concern, interactions (anxiety cycle, stress mimicking cardiac), and transcript illustrations with citations. No off-topic content; perfectly addresses question."
