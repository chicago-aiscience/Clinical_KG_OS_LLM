  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis and the test result as negative. It correctly identifies the patient's occupation and symptoms as evidence. However, it claims the cough 'worsened' into a dry cough, whereas the patient in the transcript (P-7) stated the intensity remained 'kind of the same'.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the majority of the key points from the Gold Answer, including the diagnosis, occupation, symptoms, coworker reaction, and the test result. It misses specific details such as the patient's specific job title (clerk), the mention of PPE, and the specific timing of the test (two weeks ago at symptom onset).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript. The citations [P-17], [P-2], [P-5], [P-35], and [P-14] are accurate and correspond to the facts stated. The only minor deviation is the description of the cough 'worsening' which is not explicitly supported by the patient's statement about intensity.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly answering the three components of the prompt (diagnosis, evidence, and results) without any off-topic information."
