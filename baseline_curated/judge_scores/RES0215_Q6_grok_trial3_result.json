  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: The Generated Answer accurately restates the three immediate next steps from [D-58] (physical exam, consult physician, follow-up discussion), matching the Gold Answer exactly with correct citation. It notes no other specifics, consistent with Gold. For environmental factors, it correctly identifies carpets from [P-54] as assessed, which is factual and present in Gold, with no contradictions or invented facts. All stated facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript, no errors introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: Plan - physical exam, consult physician, return to discuss (covered 3/3); offer for questions (missed); no specific tests/meds (implicitly covered); Env factors - smokes [P-53], new carpets [P-54 incl. timing], pets [P-55], fireplaces/stoves [P-56], air filters [P-57], townhouse/family context [P-50/P-49] (only carpets covered, 1/6). Covers core plan fully but only ~17% of env factors and misses question offer; overall ~50-60% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer directly verifiable in transcript: plan from [D-58], carpets from [P-54], citations accurate. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the two-part question (plan and env factors), uses clear headings, cites transcript, no tangents or off-topic content; perfectly focused."
