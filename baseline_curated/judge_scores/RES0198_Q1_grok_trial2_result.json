  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer correctly identifies stuffy nose (congestion), runny nose (rhinorrhea) for 1 week, initially stuffy now mostly running [P-1-P-3], clear discharge [P-5], and explicit denials of cough [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat/shortness of breath/fevers/chills [P-7], loss of taste/smell [P-16]. Generated Answer partially matches nasal symptoms from [P-1] but omits duration and evolution; incorrectly states no description of discharge character despite [P-5] 'mostly clear'; fabricates absence of denials despite multiple explicit 'No' responses in transcript matching Gold. Significant contradictions on discharge and denials lead to score 2.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) stuffy nose/congestion, runny nose/rhinorrhea for 1 week [P-1,P-2]; (2) initially stuffy, now mostly running [P-3]; (3) mostly clear discharge [P-5]; (4) denied cough [P-4]; (5) no post-nasal drip [P-6]; (6) no sore throat/SOB/fevers/chills [P-7]; (7) no loss taste/smell [P-16]; (8) mild fatigue/other negatives. Generated covers only basic nasal symptoms (~25% coverage), misses discharge entirely, misses all denials; score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims grounded in [P-1] for symptoms (accurate); [P-10] for runny nose persistence (minor stretch); but hallucinates 'no description of discharge character' despite direct [P-5] 'mostly clear'; hallucinates 'no evidence' of denials despite [P-4,P-6,P-7,P-16] explicit 'No'; cites irrelevant [P-11],[P-23] for denials. Multiple unverifiable absences and wrong citations indicate multiple hallucinations; score 2.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured directly around the question's three parts (nasal symptoms, discharge character, related symptom denials) with no off-topic content or tangents; perfectly focused despite inaccuracies; score 5."
