  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the duration of attachment (72+ hours), the exposure activities (hiking and gardening), and the prior history (bullseye rash 10 years ago). However, it defines 'Geographic Risk Assessment' as the doctor identifying the deer tick as a vector, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer define it specifically as the assessment of the Strathroy location using the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific location (Strathroy), the consultation of the Ontario distribution map, and the patient's concern that all ticks in the area are now potential carriers regardless of species. These were central to the geographic risk assessment requested by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript and correctly attributed to the speakers.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question and structures the response according to the requested categories (duration, exposure, history, and geographic risk)."
