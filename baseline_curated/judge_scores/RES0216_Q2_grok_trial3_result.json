  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists three medications (salbutamol for asthma, Ramipril for high blood pressure, occasional Tylenol for headaches); Generated lists only two (salbutamol and Ramipril), omitting Tylenol. Conditions for listed meds match (asthma and hypertension). Key error: Generated claims patient 'maintains adherence to his daily maintenance inhaler' [P-17], but Gold and transcript [P-19] detail prescribed twice daily but now only morning, skipping evening for a while—significant factual contradiction on core adherence change. Rescue inhaler details partially align (not refilled, not needed). Introduces 'knowledge graph' confirmations, absent from transcript. Significant factual errors on med list and adherence.",
    "completeness": "Gold covers: 3 meds + conditions/citations; maintenance inhaler bid prescribed but reduced to qAM with skipping PM [P-19]; no rescue refill/need for couple years [P-17/18]; justifications/clinician notes. Generated covers: 2/3 meds + conditions; rescue details partial; claims maintenance adherence without dosing change details. Misses Tylenol, critical maintenance dosing reduction (halving frequency), full adherence gaps. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Salbutamol/Ramipril mentions verifiable [P-25/26], conditions inferred from context [P-16/24] but 'knowledge graph confirms' fully hallucinated (no such source). Maintenance 'maintains adherence' [P-17] partially grounded but ignores/contradicts [P-19] dosing details. Rescue quotes accurate [P-17]. Multiple hallucinations (knowledge graph, overstated adherence) and inaccurate claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around current meds/conditions and asthma adherence changes, with sections matching question components; minor off-topic via hallucinated 'knowledge graph' references."
