  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the patient's current statin therapy for cholesterol (matching Gold's [P-14][P-15]) and the proposal for prophylactic antibiotics due to >72-hour attachment risk ([D-6][D-18], aligning with Gold). Minor discrepancy: refers to 'high cholesterol' (inferred but not explicit in transcript/Gold, which says 'cholesterol'). Omits allergies and past treatment but no factual errors in stated claims. References to 'knowledge graph' not in Gold or transcript but facts cited (e.g., statin for cholesterol) are consistent. Core facts fully consistent, minor extras.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: current statin/cholesterol [P-14/15]; no allergies [P-16/17]; past tick bite/abx [P-3]; prophylactic abx proposal (>72h [D-6], safer [D-18], forward [D-13]); no specifics; consult physician [D-13/22]; insecticide [D-18]. Generated covers: statin current; prophylactic abx with reasoning (>72h, safer). Misses: allergies, past history, no specifics stated, consult physician, insecticide. Covers ~60% (core current statin and new prophylactic).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about statin [P-14/15] and abx proposal [D-6/18] verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. However, multiple references to 'knowledge graph' (e.g., triples like statin--[TAKEN_FOR]-->high cholesterol, abx for Lyme) not present in transcript, appearing hallucinated/unverifiable. 'High cholesterol' slightly embellished from 'cholesterol'. Some hallucinated elements but main claims grounded.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for medications/treatments discussed, specifically current statin and new prophylactic for tick bite. Generated Answer directly lists and explains these (statin current, prophylactic abx new), with focused summary. No off-topic content; perfectly addresses query."
