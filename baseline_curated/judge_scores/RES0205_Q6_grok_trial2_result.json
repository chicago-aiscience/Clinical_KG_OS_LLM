  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's stated plan from [D-37], including the exact physical examination components ('quick listen to your heart and lungs' and 'quick physical exam') and the consultative process (consulting the supervising doctor, reviewing discussion, returning to discuss next steps). It is fully consistent with the core facts in the Gold Answer, with no factual errors or contradictions; minor omissions like the foreshadowing in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], and trainee context do not introduce inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: multi-step plan, specific physical exam components (heart/lungs auscultation and quick exam), consultative process with supervising physician and review/discussion of next steps (100% of core plan details). Missed: reference to foreshadowing [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], no diagnosis/meds context, and trainee interpretation (additional elaborations, ~20% of Gold content). Covers 80-99% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer directly verifiable in [D-37] with accurate quotes ('quick listen to your heart and lungs', 'quick physical exam', 'go get the doctor that I'm working with and go over everything you talked about', 'where to go from here'). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the question's elements (plan at end, specified exam components, process for next steps) using bullet points and citations, with no off-topic content or tangents; perfectly focused."
