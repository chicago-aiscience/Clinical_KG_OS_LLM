  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately lists Ventolin and Spiriva as current respiratory inhalers, atorvastatin as current non-respiratory med, specifies Ventolin ~10 times past week [P-12], and diuretic as previously prescribed but discontinued without approval. Generated Answer correctly identifies inhalers and atorvastatin, but incorrectly presents the diuretic as a current med 'being on' ([P-35] refers to past use per [P-34]), and factually errs by claiming Ventolin frequency is 'not stated' despite explicit transcript evidence of ~10 times/week [P-12]; also minor citation inaccuracy ([P-33] is condition, not med). These are significant factual errors on key elements like current meds and frequency.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Ventolin/Spiriva current; Ventolin 10x/week; atorvastatin current; diuretic past, discontinued own. Generated covers inhalers (100%), atorvastatin (yes), discontinued diuretic (yes), but misses Ventolin frequency entirely and conflates diuretic as current; covers ~60% accurately (inhalers, atorva, discontinuation) but misses/errs on frequency and med status.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims for inhalers [P-11] verifiable; atorvastatin [P-38] verifiable (though cites [P-33] plausibly related); diuretic past use verifiable but misrepresented as current; discontinuation [P-35] verifiable. However, falsely claims Ventolin frequency 'not stated' or only 'increased' [P-11]—directly contradicts [P-12] ('almost 10 times'); this is hallucination/omission of transcript fact, with multiple unverifiable/misstated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around meds prior (resp/non), Ventolin use, discontinued med; addresses all question parts despite errors; no off-topic content."
