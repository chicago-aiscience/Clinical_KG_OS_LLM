  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's plan to 'review the story with the doctors' from [D-47]. However, it incorrectly characterizes the summary assessment as a 'respiratory infection' diagnosis when the Gold Answer shows the doctor only described symptoms without making a diagnosis. The Gold Answer specifically notes the doctor said 'you don't have any constitutional symptoms,' while the Generated Answer incorrectly states the doctor emphasized 'no constitutional symptoms other than fatigue and potential pain.' The Generated Answer also incorrectly references a 'Knowledge Graph' that doesn't exist in the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the doctor's plan and attempts to address the summary assessment and next steps. However, it misses key elements from the Gold Answer: (1) the explicit note that this was likely a trainee/medical student conducting the encounter who would present to a supervising physician, (2) the doctor's response 'We'll see what we can do' after the patient's concern, (3) the explicit statement that no specific tests, imaging, or treatments were ordered, and (4) that next steps would be guided by the supervising physician's assessment. The answer covers approximately 50-60% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations. It repeatedly references a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not appear in the source transcript, creating citations to non-existent source material. It incorrectly characterizes the condition as a 'respiratory infection' when the doctor never made this diagnosis in the transcript. The claim about 'potential pain' being a constitutional symptom is misleading since the patient only mentioned pain when coughing [P-3], not as a separate symptom. These fabrications substantially undermine faithfulness to the source.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: the doctor's plan, the summary assessment, and what would guide next steps. However, it includes irrelevant references to a non-existent knowledge graph throughout. The core content remains focused on answering the question, though with significant accuracy issues."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's plan to review with other doctors but significantly misrepresents the summary assessment by claiming a 'respiratory infection' diagnosis that was never made. It contains multiple hallucinations, particularly repeated references to a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph,' which severely undermines faithfulness. The answer misses important details about the trainee nature of the encounter, lack of specific orders, and the supervising physician's role in next steps. While it addresses all parts of the question, the factual errors and fabricated citations result in a below-average evaluation."
