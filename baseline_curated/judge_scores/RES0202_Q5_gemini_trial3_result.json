  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the mother's suspicion that the illness was contracted at school, the timeline of symptoms starting after school on Wednesday, the lack of known sick contacts outside of school, the uncertainty of contacts at school, and the lack of notification from the school.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the majority of the key points. However, it misses two details present in the gold answer: 1) The school's requirement for a COVID test to return so they could notify other families of potential exposure, and 2) The exclusion of other sources like travel or home environmental factors (mold, asbestos) which the gold answer uses to further support school as the likely source.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript. The citations [P-1], [P-2], and [P-38] are used correctly. While [D-44] is cited for the mother's action, the content regarding the mother's suspicion is accurately reflected in the text from the relevant sections of the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the child's school attendance, sick contacts, and school notifications as requested in the prompt."
