  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer on all points it covers; no errors or contradictions are present. All details such as onset two weeks ago, flu-like symptoms in first couple days, resolution of other symptoms in 3-4 days, productive cough with whitish clear mucus for 4-5 days, transition to dry cough thereafter, persistence of cough, and chest soreness from coughing match the Gold Answer and transcript exactly.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: onset of cough and flu-like symptoms two weeks ago [P-2, P-14]; resolution of other flu-like symptoms in first 3-4 days [P-14]; mucus production duration (first 4-5 days) and appearance (whitish clear) [P-6]; transition to dry cough after 4-5 days [P-5, P-6]; persistence of dry cough; chest soreness [P-15]. Key points missed: specific initial sore throat and runny nose in first 2-3 days and their resolution [P-13, P-14]; cough intensity remained the same [P-7]; frequency stable at 3-4 times per hour, spontaneous [P-8, P-9, P-10]; no fevers [P-12]; COVID test negative at onset and staying home [P-35, P-36]. Covers approximately 80% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: cough duration [P-2], flu-like symptoms [P-14], resolution [P-14], mucus details [P-6], transition [P-5, P-6], chest soreness [P-15]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; inferences like 'majority of the time' are accurate based on timeline.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by providing a structured timeline of symptom progression, covering onset, initial symptoms, mucus phase, transition to dry cough, resolution of other symptoms, and persistence, with no off-topic content; it is perfectly focused despite missing some details."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly accurate, faithful, and relevant, providing a solid timeline of symptom progression but moderately incomplete by omitting details on cough intensity, frequency stability, specific initial symptoms like sore throat, absence of fever, and COVID test."
