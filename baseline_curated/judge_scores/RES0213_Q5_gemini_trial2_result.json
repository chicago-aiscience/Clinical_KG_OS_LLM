  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core facts: the father's heart attack in his 50s, the patient's stress regarding her Masters thesis, and the difficulty of quitting smoking. However, it contains a minor contradiction regarding smoking, stating it 'does not confirm current active smoking' while simultaneously quoting the patient saying she smokes 5 cigarettes a day (P-14). It also mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the provided transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main themes but misses several specific illustrative details found in the Gold Answer and transcript: the paternal grandfather's death in an accident (limiting known history), the specific age smoking began (18), the duration of heavy smoking (10/day for 2 years), the fact that she lives alone in London, and her recent nervousness about running.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript, though it hallucinations the existence of a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information. The interpretation of the interactions (stress-induced symptoms being interpreted as cardiac due to family history) is well-supported by the text.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, structuring the answer exactly according to the three factors requested in the prompt and providing specific illustrative connections for each."
