  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's assessment of asthma as the top differential (phrased as 'exacerbation' vs Gold's 'reoccurring in some capacity' - minor interpretive discrepancy), physical exam plans, initial rescue puffer trial, and contingency plan. Minor issues: calls it 'exacerbation' (not verbatim), assumes salbutamol as rescue (contextually correct but patient lists it separately), omits patient currently lacks rescue inhaler (Gold notes explicitly), and adds interpretive 'shift to acute flare-up'. Core facts consistent, no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: assessment as top differential [D-35], quick PE with lung auscultation [D-35], rescue puffer trial on walks [D-35], contingency to revisit if no improvement [D-35,D-36]. Partially covers stepwise approach. Missed/explicit in Gold but not detailed: patient lacks rescue now [P-17/18], pending exam findings for further invx, consult with supervising doc [D-35/37], 'therapeutic trial' framing. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: assessment [D-35], symptoms different [P-16], cardiac lower [D-36], PE [D-35], rescue trial [D-35], contingency [D-35/36], past salbutamol [P-25]. 'Exacerbation' and 'acute flare-up' are plausible interpretations of 'reoccurring asthma' but not verbatim (minor unverifiable phrasing). No hallucinations or fabrications; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address question components (assessment, PE components, first-step intervention, contingency); minor interpretive additions but no off-topic content."
