  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the availability of information in the transcript. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not provide info on whether the cough is productive or the appearance of the nasal discharge. However, the transcript explicitly confirms the cough is dry/non-productive ([D-5, P-5], [D-6, P-6]) and the nasal discharge is 'pretty clear' ([D-12, P-12]).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover two out of the three specific details requested in the prompt: the nature of the cough and the appearance of the nasal discharge. While it identifies the symptoms and duration, it misses the core characteristics defined in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a form of negative hallucination by claiming information is missing when it is clearly present in the source transcript. It fails to ground its response in the dialogue at [D-5], [D-6], and [D-12].",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it identifies the two respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose), but it fails to provide the specific descriptive details (productive/non-productive and appearance) that the prompt explicitly asked for."
