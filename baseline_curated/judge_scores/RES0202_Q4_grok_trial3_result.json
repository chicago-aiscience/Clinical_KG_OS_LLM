  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition and fever as the reason for exclusion, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. However, it inaccurately cites [D-44] instead of [D-45] for the doctor's statement, misphrases the exclusion as 'rules out the asthma medical history' (Gold notes it's not permanently ruled out), and omits supporting details like no wheezing [P-7] and uncertain shortness of breath [P-8]. Minor discrepancies with core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: asthma as condition ([D-45]), hypothetical presentation (cough/shortness of breath without fever), and fever as excluding finding (cites [P-1],[P-2]). Misses Gold's details like exact quote, conclusion 'sounds like an infection,' supporting no wheeze/SOB, and nuance on prioritization vs. permanent exclusion (covers ~85% of key points).",
    "faithfulness": "Doctor's statement on asthma is verifiable but wrongly cited as [D-44] (actual [D-45]); fever reports accurate [P-1,P-2]. Hallucinates 'knowledge graph' evidence not in transcript and 'rules out asthma medical history' phrasing not supported. Multiple inaccuracies and fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by naming asthma and fever as the specific finding excluding it, with minimal extraneous content."
