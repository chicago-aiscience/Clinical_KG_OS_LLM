  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the primary symptoms (fever and sore throat) and the differential information (flu vaccination status) as specified in the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The 'broader symptom cluster' (muscle aches and stuffy nose) that supported a viral illness, and 2) the epidemiological context regarding the patient's husband having similar symptoms, which specifically prioritized COVID-19 in the doctor's reasoning.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is fully grounded in the transcript and correctly cites the relevant dialogue markers ([D-53], [D-54]).",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses both parts of the question without any irrelevant information."
