  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all key facts from the Gold Answer: sudden-onset shortness of breath upon waking, dry cough that began suddenly that morning, seizure the previous night, epilepsy diagnosis, and temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius checked that morning. The facts are accurately presented and consistent with both the Gold Answer and source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all essential respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, dry cough), neurological symptoms (seizure, epilepsy), and the objective fever measurement (37.4°C). However, it omits several pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer such as denial of chest pain, feeling faint, sore throat, runny nose, and no prior shortness of breath episodes. It also doesn't specify the timing details (3 hours before consultation, temperature checked that morning) as precisely as the Gold Answer. Coverage is approximately 75-80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The shortness of breath [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], missed medication [P-9], and temperature of 37.4 [P-5] are all properly sourced. No hallucinated content is present. The answer stays grounded in the transcript evidence.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, dry cough), neurological symptoms (seizure, epilepsy), and objective fever measurement (37.4°C). The organization mirrors the question structure, making it highly focused and relevant with no off-topic content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies all key symptoms and measurements requested in the question with proper citations from the transcript. It demonstrates strong correctness, faithfulness, and relevance. The main limitation is incomplete coverage of pertinent negatives and some timing details present in the Gold Answer, resulting in slightly reduced completeness. Overall, this is a high-quality response that effectively addresses the clinical question with factual accuracy."
