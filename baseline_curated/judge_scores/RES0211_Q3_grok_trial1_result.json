  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key symptoms like dry cough [P-1], scratchy throat [P-1], subjective fever [P-7, D-58], and headache [P-1, D-58] matching the Gold Answer, and notes absences of sputum, GI symptoms, and joint pain, but introduces a non-existent 'knowledge graph' not in the Gold Answer or transcript, has minor citation inaccuracies (e.g., sputum denial primarily in P-5/P-6, not just D-58), and omits details like timeline, malaise, and fatigue from Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: dry cough [P-1,P-4], subjective fever [P-7,P-9], scratchy throat [P-4], headache [P-1,P-2], no sputum/phlegm [P-5,P-6], no GI (nausea/vomiting [P-11], diarrhea [P-12]), no joint pain [P-13]; misses 3-4 day timeline [P-1,P-3], malaise [P-14,D-15], fatigue [P-13], brother's cold [P-39], and doctor's full summary framing.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims grounded (symptoms directly from P-1, P-7 etc.); hallucinations include 'knowledge graph' (absent from transcript), misinterpretation of D-58 for sputum (actual denial in P-5/P-6), 'plugged up' [P-18] from allergy context stretched to sputum absence; 'likely asked about' GI/joint understates explicit denials [P-11-13].",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how symptoms (dry cough, fever, scratchy throat, headache) and absences (sputum, GI, joint pain) support URI assessment with structured evidence from transcript, no off-topic content."
