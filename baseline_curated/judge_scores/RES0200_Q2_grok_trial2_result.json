  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Ventolin and Spiriva as current respiratory inhalers (matching Gold [P-11]) and atorvastatin (Torva Staten) as a current non-respiratory drug (matching Gold [P-38]). It also notes the diuretic as a previously prescribed non-respiratory drug that was discontinued without approval (matching Gold [P-35, P-36]). However, significant errors include: (1) incorrectly listing the diuretic as one of the medications 'being on' prior to the visit, implying current use when the patient states 'I used to take... but I don't right now' [P-34]; (2) falsely claiming no specific Ventolin frequency was stated and providing a hallucinated example ('four times a day'), contradicting the transcript and Gold which cite ~10 times in the past week [P-12]. These are significant factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Ventolin and Spiriva as current inhalers; (2) Ventolin used ~10x past week; (3) atorvastatin current; (4) diuretic previously prescribed but discontinued without approval. Covered: (1) yes; (3) yes; (4) yes (discontinued diuretic). Missed: precise Ventolin frequency (10x week), instead vaguely notes 'a lot more' and wrongly claims unspecified. Covers ~75% of key points (misses core quantified frequency explicitly asked in question).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims for Ventolin/Spiriva and atorvastatin grounded in [P-11, P-38]; diuretic discontinuation in [P-35]. However, hallucinations include: referencing non-existent 'knowledge graph'; inaccurate citation [P-33] for atorvastatin (it's cholesterol diagnosis, not med); wrongly asserting no specific Ventolin frequency stated despite clear [P-12] ('almost like 10 times'); invented example 'four times a day'. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around question parts (meds prior by category, Ventolin frequency, discontinued med). Minor irrelevancies: non-existent knowledge graph reference, off-topic frequency example, but core content focused on query."
