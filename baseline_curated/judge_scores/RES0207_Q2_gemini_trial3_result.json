  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medication (Keppra) and the condition (epilepsy). It also correctly identifies that the patient forgot the dose. No factual errors are present.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to provide the 'specific circumstance' requested by the prompt. While the Gold Answer details the daughter's birthday and the change in dinner routine as the specific reason for the lapse (as per turn [P-24]), the generated answer only provides the generic reason 'forgot' from turn [P-9]. It misses the contextual details about the birthday, the dinner timing, and the patient's acknowledgement of the seizure's cause.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript, specifically turns [P-9] and [P-23]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but fails to fully satisfy the prompt's request for a 'specific circumstance.' By providing a generic 'forgot' rather than the situational details available in the text, it only partially addresses the user's specific query."
