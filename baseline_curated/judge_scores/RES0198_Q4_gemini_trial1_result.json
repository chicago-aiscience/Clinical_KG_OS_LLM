  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer regarding the condition (COVID-19), the test (swab), the timeline (48 hours), and the primary instruction (isolation).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all major points requested by the question. It misses one minor detail present in the gold answer: that 'further instructions from public health' would be provided once results were returned. However, since the question specifically asked for instructions 'while awaiting' results, the generated answer is highly complete for that specific timeframe.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript citations ([P-1], [D-39]). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, structured clearly to address each specific part of the multi-part question without unnecessary filler."
