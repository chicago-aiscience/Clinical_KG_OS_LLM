  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has some factual inaccuracies compared to the Gold Answer: it understates the cough duration as 'at least a month' instead of three months [P-2]; omits that the cough was initially dry and intermittent starting at pole dancing class [P-2, P-13]; misses no foul smell noticed [P-11], exercise impairment [P-47], chest discomfort specifically only when coughing (not 'pain' generally), and full list of denied symptoms like night sweats [P-5], weight loss [P-6-8], nausea/vomiting [P-17], stiff neck [P-18], and sick contacts [P-14,15,32]; incorrectly includes eczema as an associated symptom, which is a past history not tied to the current respiratory complaint; citations are mostly accurate but D-47 for blood denial is a doctor summary rather than direct patient denial [P-10]. Core facts on recent productive greenish sputum, cough pain when coughing, sleep disruption, subjective fever, and fatigue are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: productive cough with greenish gross gunk past 3 days [P-2,9,12]; no blood [P-10]; cough wakes at night last month causing fatigue [P-19-21]; chest discomfort when coughing [P-3]; subjective fevers [P-4]. Missed: full 3-month duration with initial dry/recurrent nature and pole dancing onset [P-2,13]; no foul smell [P-11]; impaired exercise [P-47]; most denied symptoms (night sweats [P-5], weight loss [P-6-8], nausea/vomiting [P-17], stiff neck [P-18], sick contacts [P-14,15,32]). Covers approximately 25-40% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript: cough duration and worsening [P-2,12,19]; pain when coughing [P-3]; sputum characteristics [P-2,9]; sleep disturbance [P-19,20,21]; subjective fever [P-4]; eczema history [P-22,23]; fatigue [P-19]; denied pain [P-19]; no blood [P-10, D-47]. No hallucinations; citations are accurate or close (e.g., D-47 summarizes patient report).",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses reported respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum), characteristics, associated symptoms (sleep, fever, fatigue), and some denied symptoms, structured clearly; minor irrelevance in including eczema (past history, not respiratory/associated) and incomplete denies, but no major off-topic content."
