  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19) and the test used. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not provide the timing of the test relative to symptom onset. The transcript (P-36) explicitly states the test was done 'when I first started having symptoms'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to provide the timing of the test (stating it's unknown), 2) It omits the patient's specific role as a 'clerk', 3) It misses the detail about the patient currently staying home and wanting to return to work without being a perceived health risk.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript does not explicitly state the time lag for the test, which is a hallucination of absence; the information is present in P-36 ('when I first started having symptoms'). The rest of the answer is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, although it fails to find the answer for one part despite it being in the text."
