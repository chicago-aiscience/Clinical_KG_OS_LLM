  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures core elements from the Gold Answer, such as the patient's history of asthma (P-16), presenting symptoms like chest tightness and shortness of breath (P-1, P-7), absence of cardiac pain (P-1, D-36), and the doctor's proposal for rescue puffers (D-35). However, it introduces discrepancies by referencing a 'knowledge graph' multiple times, which is not present in the transcript or Gold Answer, and it misattributes some details (e.g., doctor noting maintenance inhaler directly in D-35). It also omits key linkages like medication non-adherence. Overall, core facts are consistent with minor extraneous additions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: history of asthma [P-16, P-29 partially], symptoms of chest tightness worsened by exertion and SOB [P-1, P-7, P-9/10 partially], absence of cardiac indicators [D-36], therapeutic trial [D-35]. Missed: specific medication non-adherence (skipping evening dose P-19, no rescue refill P-17/18, doctor's summary D-34), patient noting it feels different but could be related [P-16 nuance], no environmental triggers [P-33]. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are verifiable: symptoms [P-1, P-7], asthma history [P-16, P-25], cardiac differentiation [D-36], rescue puffers [D-35]. However, repeated references to 'knowledge graph information' and its classification/support for salbutamol are not in the transcript, representing hallucinated content. Minor over-attribution like maintenance inhaler directly from D-35 (implied but from earlier). Some unverifiable but plausible details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around presenting symptoms, medical history, clinical features, and doctor's linking logic, perfectly mirroring the question's focus with no off-topic content."
