  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer and transcript. The doctor *did* systematically explore exposure sources: living situation (apartment, alone), home environmental triggers (carpets/dust/mold/asbestos/pets), sick contacts, workplace details (car dealership; lunchroom contact; whether coworkers were sick), and travel (denied). The Generated Answer incorrectly states these were not explored and claims the only background item was smoking, which is false.",
    "completeness": "It misses essentially all key exposure-history elements in the Gold Answer: living situation, environmental triggers, sick contacts, workplace setting and coworker illness, and travel. It mentions smoking and COVID suspicion, but those do not substitute for the asked exposure sources. Overall coverage is well under 20% of required points.",
    "faithfulness": "Although it references true transcript elements (smoking was asked; COVID testing/\"contact tracing\" was mentioned), its central claim—\"the doctor did not systematically explore\" exposures and \"no specific inquiries were made\"—is directly contradicted by multiple transcript lines (D-45/46/47/48/49/50). This constitutes ungrounded/contradictory reporting of the transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at the exposure-history question, but instead of listing the explored exposure sources, it incorrectly denies that they were explored and adds some tangential discussion of COVID symptom overlap. It is partially on-topic but does not provide the requested information."
