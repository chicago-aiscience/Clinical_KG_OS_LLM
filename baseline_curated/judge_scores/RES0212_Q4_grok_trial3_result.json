  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misidentifies key constitutional symptoms (e.g., vaguely references generalized pain/fatigue instead of specifically night sweats, unexplained weight loss, and hemoptysis as in Gold); incorrectly lists chest pain and exposures like cats/alcohol (not highlighted in Gold as relevant denials); partially correct on TB exclusion but attributes wrong screenings; significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold's precise list.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: constitutional symptoms (night sweats [D5], weight loss [D6-8], hemoptysis [D10]), exposures (sick contacts [D14,15,32], travel [D33-34], IV drugs [D40], cocaine/heroin [D39]), conditions (TB, malignancy, endemic infections), others (stiff neck [D18], N/V [D17], pain [D19]), summary [D47]. Generated covers TB exclusion vaguely (~20%), green sputum (irrelevant), adds bronchiectasis/chest pain/cats/alcohol (misses 80%+ specifics).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like chest pain denial partially grounded [D3,P3,P19] but overstated; constitutional symptoms vaguely tied to [D47,P19] but not specific transcript quotes; exposure risks hallucinated (cats [P27], alcohol [P42] not as 'screened risks' per [D47]); 'knowledge graph' not in transcript; multiple unverifiable/misattributed details.",
    "relevance": "Addresses screenings/denials and TB exclusion but with incorrect specifics (e.g., chest pain, cats/alcohol instead of core symptoms/exposures); off-topic tangents to fatigue, bronchiectasis, respiratory infection; partially on-topic for question."
