  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists all laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab), imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (oxygen saturation and supplemental oxygen if needed), and therapeutic interventions (steroids, antibiotics as new; bronchodilators continued, specifying Ventolin/Spiriva) as per the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. It is fully consistent with no factual errors; the Gold Answer's additional mention of blood pressure monitoring [D-37] is not part of the core COPD exacerbation plan and its omission does not constitute an error.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: all labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABGs, COVID swab), chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring and supplemental oxygen if needed, continuation of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics. The only point not covered is the additional blood pressure monitoring [D-37], which Gold presents as supplementary rather than core to the COPD plan; thus, 100% of primary key points covered.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-52] with accurate citations. Bronchodilator names (Ventolin, Spiriva) grounded in [P-11] and referenced by doctor. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response into exact categories requested (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics with new/continued distinction), focused solely on the COPD exacerbation management plan with no off-topic content."
