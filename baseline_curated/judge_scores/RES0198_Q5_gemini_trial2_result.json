  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the nephew in daycare and the type 1 diabetes diagnosis. However, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source text or gold answer. It accurately reflects that the doctor inquired about insulin adherence.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific details present in the gold answer, including the age of diabetes diagnosis (7), the duration of symptoms (one week), the fact that the patient sees an endocrinologist, and the specific observation that the doctor did not explicitly link diabetes to immune function during the encounter.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is mostly faithful but hallucinates an external source called the 'Knowledge Graph' to explain the causal relationship, which is not mentioned in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the two parts of the question: the infectious source and the relation to the chronic condition."
