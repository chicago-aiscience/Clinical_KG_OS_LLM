  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It accurately identifies the onset of the cough on Wednesday night, the progression on Thursday (worsening cough, tiredness), and the peak of symptoms on Friday (worsening cough, fever of 100.1-101°F, decreased appetite, and suspected loss of taste).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the gold answer. Specifically, it omits the mention of the 'runny nose' on Friday [P-16] and the explicit mention of 'fatigue' as a symptom confirmed on Friday during the review of systems [P-25]. It also omits the mother's correction of the doctor's timeline (clarifying 3 days instead of 5).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims are supported by the text, and citations are used correctly to link symptoms to specific turns in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses the question asked, providing a clear day-by-day evolution of the illness and detailing the specific symptoms requested (cough, fever, fatigue, appetite)."
