  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer inaccurately identifies constitutional symptoms and exposure risks; it mentions chest pain, generalized pain, fatigue, cats (allergy), and alcohol, but fails to list the actual ones from the Gold Answer and transcript: night sweats [D-5], unexplained weight loss [D-6-D-8], hemoptysis [D-10], sick contacts [D-14,15,32], travel [D-33-34], IV drugs/cocaine/heroin [D-39-40]. It vaguely references TB screening without specifics, introducing errors like cats/alcohol as exposures. Significant contradictions with Gold and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: minimal (vague TB mention). Missed: all specific constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis with citations), all exposure risks (sick contacts, travel, drugs with citations), stiff neck/nausea/body pain, doctor's summary [D-47]. Covers <20% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like chest pain denial partially grounded [D-3,P-3,P-19] but not constitutional; constitutional symptoms vaguely referenced via [D-47] but not specified/verified; exposure risks hallucinated (cats [P-27] is allergy, not exposure risk for cough/TB; alcohol [P-42] irrelevant); 'knowledge graph' not in transcript; multiple ungrounded claims about screenings/exclusions.",
    "relevance": "Addresses structure of question (screenings denied, conditions excluded) but with incorrect details/content (e.g., chest pain, cats/alcohol); partially relevant but includes off-topic elements like allergies/alcohol."
