    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source text. It hallucinates a lack of data, claiming doctor statements are missing when they are clearly present in the provided transcript. It incorrectly characterizes the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question. Instead of identifying the next steps, it provides a reasoning for why it cannot answer, which is based on an incorrect observation of the text."
