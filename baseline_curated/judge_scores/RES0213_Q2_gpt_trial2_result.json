  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three OTC products the patient tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and correctly states they were not very effective, matching [P-6]. It also correctly notes the patient’s only routine supplement was a multivitamin, matching [P-25]. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core Gold Answer elements needed to answer the question: (1) Tylenol, (2) Advil, (3) Alka-Seltzer, (4) poor/ineffective relief, and (5) routine multivitamin. It does not explicitly include the Gold Answer’s statement that the patient is on no other medications/no prescriptions (though this is implied by listing only the multivitamin). It also omits the Gold Answer’s additional non-medication context (stress management, smoking reduction), but those are not directly asked for in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript citations provided: OTC trials and lack of benefit are in [P-6], and multivitamin use is in [P-25]. No hallucinated medications, supplements, or effects are introduced.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what OTC medications/supplements were taken and the effectiveness of pain-relief attempts, with no substantial irrelevant content."
