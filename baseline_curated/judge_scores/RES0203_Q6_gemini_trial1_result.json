  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by explicitly stating that the transcript does not mention a plan to consult a supervising physician. However, turn [D-40] clearly states, 'we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today.' It also misses the doctor's mention of potential 'additional tests.'",
    "completeness": "The response covers the assessment, the COVID-19 swab test, self-isolation instructions, and the timeline. It misses the mention of additional tests and the plan for the doctor to return with more questions. Most importantly, it fails to include the supervising physician's involvement as requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source text in turn [D-40], claiming the absence of information regarding a supervisor that is explicitly present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly attempting to answer all sub-parts of the prompt, although it provides incorrect information for one of them."
