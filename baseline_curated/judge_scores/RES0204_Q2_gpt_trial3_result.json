  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that a COVID swab was proposed and correctly gives the stated rationale: it was being done for “anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately” (standard protocol) [D-39]. However, it does not mention the other proposed diagnostic procedure (chest X-ray) that is clearly discussed in the transcript [D-37]. This is primarily an omission rather than a direct contradiction of stated facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) chest X-ray proposed to better look at what’s going on [D-37/D-39], (2) COVID nasal swab proposed, (3) rationale for COVID swab = protocol for anyone with these symptoms [D-39], (4) plan to arrange tests and return with supervising doctor [D-40], (5) no meds prescribed. Generated Answer includes only (2) and (3). It misses the chest X-ray and the rest of the plan/context.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims (COVID swab proposed; rationale based on institutional practice for these symptoms) are directly supported by the transcript [D-39]. No additional unsupported details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic and addresses the COVID-swab rationale explicitly, but it does not answer the full question about all diagnostic procedures proposed (it omits the chest X-ray)."
