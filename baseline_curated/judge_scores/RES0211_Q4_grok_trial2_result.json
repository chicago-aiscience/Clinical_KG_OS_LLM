  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually inaccurate compared to the Gold Answer: it incorrectly claims the transcript lacks details on eczema, EpiPen, and night sweats (present in D-9/P-9, D-21/P-21, D-32/P-33); misattributes asthma screening to D-58 (summary) instead of D-29/P-29 and family history P-30/P-31; ignores screenings for productive cough (D-5/D-6), severe allergies (D-18), rashes (D-10), GI symptoms (D-11/D-12), and joint pain (D-13); fabricates a URI diagnosis and allergy timeline differentiation not central to Gold Answer. Significant contradictions and omissions make it mostly incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: night sweats (covered), productive cough, severe allergies/EpiPen, personal/family asthma, family eczema, rashes, GI symptoms, joint pain—with citations and responses. Generated covers ~10% (vague asthma mention); misses 90%+ including all listed examples (eczema, EpiPen, night sweats) and others; adds irrelevant medication/allergy details and URI conclusion.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims unverifiable or wrong: transcript has eczema (D-32/33), EpiPen (D-21), night sweats (D-9), contrary to Generated's denial; asthma/meds cited wrongly (D-58 is summary, not screening); hallucinates absence of transcript details, adds 'Upper Respiratory Infection (URI)' diagnosis and allergy differentiation not grounded for this question; multiple fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Partially addresses screening for asthma but denies/misses other question-specified conditions (eczema, EpiPen, night sweats); deviates into medication history, symptom review, and speculative diagnosis narrowing (URI vs. allergy), diluting focus on targeted screenings and responses."
