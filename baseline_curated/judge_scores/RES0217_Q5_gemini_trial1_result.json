  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the information regarding Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map is missing from the transcript. This directly contradicts the Source Transcript, where turn [D-13] explicitly mentions the map and identifies Strathroy as a 'concerning point.' The first part regarding the 72-hour duration is mostly accurate, though the patient's history of a prior rash was mentioned as a past event [P-3], not the primary justification for current prophylaxis as the Generated Answer suggests.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover the second half of the question regarding the geographic risk justification. While it explains the 72-hour calculation well, it completely omits the key points from the Gold Answer regarding the map and Strathroy's status as a high-risk area, covering only about 50% of the required information.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant 'negative hallucination' by asserting that the geographic mapping data is not present in the text, despite it being clearly stated in the transcript [D-12, D-13]. This claim is unfaithful to the source provided.",
    "relevance": "The first paragraph is relevant and addresses the timing of the tick attachment. However, the second paragraph is irrelevant/incorrect as it denies the premise of the second part of the question rather than answering it using the available data."
