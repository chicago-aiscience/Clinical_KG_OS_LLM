  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains two significant factual errors regarding the timeline. It states the transcript does not specify the duration of the chronic cough, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions '10 years' in [P-3]. It also identifies the COPD diagnosis as occurring 'a couple years ago' [P-1], failing to include the patient's clarification in [P-2] that it was 'probably five years ago'.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 50% of the specific temporal milestones requested (10 years for cough, 5 years for COPD). While it accurately captures the recent worsening (1 week for cough/sputum and a few days for shortness of breath), it lacks the specific exertion triggers and the mention of chills included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a 'hallucination of absence' by claiming the transcript does not specify the cough duration. It also ignores the clarified diagnosis date provided in the text, relying only on the initial (and corrected) statement.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly addressing each part of the prompt's timeline requirements, even though the content provided is inaccurate or incomplete."
