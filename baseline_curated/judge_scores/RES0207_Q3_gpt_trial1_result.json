  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the anti-epileptic medication [P-23], notes that the patient had a seizure the prior night [P-8], and cites the patient’s own statement linking the seizure to forgetting their medication (“I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have yeah” [P-9]). However, it overstates causality by asserting a missed dose is a “direct cause” (the transcript supports patient-suspected causality, not definitive causation), and it introduces “According to the provided knowledge graph,” which is not part of the case materials.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) missed Keppra dose temporally linked to seizure; (2) patient’s self-recognition of the link via the P-9 quote. Key points missed from the Gold Answer: (a) the missed dose was due to disrupted routine around daughter’s birthday/dinner timing [P-24]; (b) the patient volunteered the causal attribution without being directly asked about adherence (it arose after D-9, about post-seizure issues); (c) patient notes seizures are uncommon for them (“usually don’t get seizures very often” [P-9]) supporting that this was an unusual trigger; (d) explicit note that no clinician confirmation of causality is given.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript, especially the medication name [P-23], seizure report [P-8], and the patient’s attribution [P-9]. But the reference to a “knowledge graph” is fabricated relative to the provided transcript, and the phrasing “direct cause” goes beyond what is explicitly supported (patient suspicion vs confirmed causality).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked linkage between missed anti-epileptic medication and the seizure, and it cites the specific conversational evidence that the patient recognized the connection."

  "summary": "Accurately captures the patient’s self-attribution of the seizure to a missed Keppra dose, but omits several supporting context points from the Gold Answer and adds an ungrounded “knowledge graph”/overconfident causality claim."
