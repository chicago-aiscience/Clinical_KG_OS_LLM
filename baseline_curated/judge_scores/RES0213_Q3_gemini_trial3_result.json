{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis of anxiety-induced chest pain. However, it misattributes the patient's comments in [P-20]; the patient stated that heart fluttering/palpitations (which she was not currently experiencing) felt like her previous anxiety attacks, not the chest pain itself. It also omits the pertinent negatives (e.g., lack of fever, no exertional worsening) which are part of the Gold Answer's clinical reasoning.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most of the key points, including the situational triggers, response to distraction, physical manifestations, history of anxiety, and current stressors. However, it misses the specific detail of the 'Masters thesis deadline/time pressure' (grouping it under 'busy schedule') and completely omits the 'pertinent negatives' section (ruling out cardiac/pulmonary issues) which constitutes a significant part of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript. However, point 4 in the generated answer incorrectly claims the patient said the 'pain' felt like previous anxiety attacks based on [P-20]. In the transcript, [P-20] refers to heart fluttering/palpitations, which the patient says she is not currently experiencing, though she had them during past attacks.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both the diagnosis and the clinical observations supporting it as requested by the question."
