  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer regarding the patient's symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheezing, chest tightness), history (diagnosed at age 8, family history), and triggers (cold, exercise, pollen). It correctly identifies the condition as a worsening of asthma.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a significant section of the Gold Answer: the exclusion of alternative diagnoses. The Gold Answer details how the clinician screened for and ruled out infectious etiologies (lack of fever, sick contacts, travel, loss of taste/smell, productive cough, etc.) to support the conclusion of 'worsening asthma rather than a new condition'. The Generated Answer also omits the specific frequency statistics (once every two weeks vs five or six times per week) mentioned in the transcript (P-8) and the Gold Answer, though they were provided in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are well-grounded in the transcript and accurately cited using the appropriate tags (e.g., [P-1], [P-15]). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question. However, by failing to mention the negative screening for infection, it doesn't fully address the 'rather than a new respiratory condition' aspect as thoroughly as the Gold Answer."
