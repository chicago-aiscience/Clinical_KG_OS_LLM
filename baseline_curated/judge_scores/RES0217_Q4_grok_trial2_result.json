  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all facts stated in the Gold Answer regarding the assessed clinical features (bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/illness, headaches) and proposed tests (tick identification, serology, physical exam). Patient denials are implied through the assessment context and match the transcript. No factual errors or contradictions; minor detail like 'Ixodes' is a correct synonym for deer tick but not verbatim from transcript/Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/illness, headaches, tick ID, serology, physical exam (100% for these). Missed: explicit 'feeling well otherwise' [D-18/P-18], no other bites [P-9], supervising physician consult [D-13/D-22], bite site specifics [P-1/D-5/D-6]. Covers ~80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: rash [D-6/P-6], joint pain [D-7], fever [D-8], headaches [D-19], tick ID [D-6/D-18], serology [D-18], physical exam [D-18]. No hallucinations; 'Ixodes' is accurate knowledge for deer tick but grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly and comprehensively addresses the question by listing assessed features of active Lyme (found absent via denials) and proposed tests with structure matching query focus; no off-topic content."
