  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is fully consistent with the Gold Answer on all factual details: assessment as infection consistent with COVID symptoms [D-44, D-45], COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround [D-44], 14-day isolation [D-44], false negatives possible [D-44], alternative of another viral illness if negative [D-44], exact warning signs listed [D-44], and note on asthma ruled out by fever [D-45]. No errors or contradictions; minor detail of isolating from sister is implied in strict isolation but not explicitly restated, yet core facts match perfectly.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: assessment (infection/COVID-like), test and time (100%), isolation period (14 days), false negatives, alternative diagnosis (viral illness), warning signs (all listed with examples), asthma differential note. Missed: explicit mention of isolation from younger sister and 'no medications/watchful waiting' (though implied by plan). Covers ~90-95% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [D-44, D-45]. No hallucinated facts; content is faithfully extracted and structured without additions or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around exact elements requested (test/time, isolation, alt dx/false neg, warning signs), with assessment and full plan. No irrelevant content or tangents."
