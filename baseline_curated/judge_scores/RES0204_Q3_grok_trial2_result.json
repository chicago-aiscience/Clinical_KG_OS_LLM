  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details specific present symptoms (dry cough 4-5 days non-improving, clear runny nose) and comprehensive pertinent negatives (no fever/chills, sore throat, normal taste/smell, chest pain, muscle/back pain, headaches, N/V/abd pain), no sick contacts/travel, family asthma hx, novelty/persistence despite absent high-acuity markers prompting CXR, and COVID swab as standard protocol regardless of absences. Generated correctly identifies persistent dry cough and some negatives (chest pain, N/V, fever/chills, taste/smell), quotes key doctor statements for CXR and swab rationales, notes new onset via lack of asthma/activity tolerance. Minor discrepancies: omits runny nose, doesn't fully list negatives or emphasize 'absent high-acuity markers,' adds interpretive 'rule out trauma/GI' not in Gold/transcript as direct reasoning. Core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: present symptoms (cough details, runny nose), full negatives list, no contacts/travel, family hx/novelty/persistence → CXR; protocol → swab. Generated covers: cough persistence/improvement, some negatives (chest pain, N/V, fever/chills, taste/smell), new onset/lack asthma/activity, direct quotes for both tests. Missed: explicit runny nose, full negatives (sore throat, headaches, muscle aches explicitly), sick contacts/travel, family hx as grandparents. Covers core rationales (persistence → CXR, protocol → swab) and ~80% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims verifiable: cough [P-2,P-7], CXR rationale [D-37], chest pain/N/V [P-15/16], COVID protocol [D-39], fever/chills [P-13], taste/smell [D-10/P-10], asthma/activity [P-28]. Patient never had dry cough [P-24] supports new onset implicitly. Minor unverifiable: 'rule out acute trauma/GI emergencies' interpretive, not doctor-stated; 'inferred' taste/smell but directly patient-confirmed. No major hallucinations, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how symptoms led to CXR (persistent cough → better look) and swab (protocol for these symptoms), incorporates some absent findings (denials support respiratory focus/new onset). Question emphasizes combination of presents (cough, nasal discharge) + specific absences; Generated focuses heavily on cough, mentions some absences but omits nasal discharge, minor tangent on ruling out non-respiratory. Mostly focused on question."
