  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the ordered test as a COVID-19 swab and accurately reflects the doctor’s stated reason for prioritizing COVID-19—household clustering (husband with similar symptoms, then patient) and the explicit quote that COVID would be the first rule-out. However, it adds emphasis on symptoms (fever/sore throat) as a reason for prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza; while symptoms support an infectious differential, the transcript does not specifically frame symptoms as the reason to prioritize COVID over flu (the doctor frames it more around transmission context and rule-out/containment). This is a minor overreach rather than a contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) COVID-19 swab ordered; (2) rationale includes husband with similar symptoms/possible household transmission; (3) mention that fever/sore throat prompts infectious rule-out (partially aligns with Gold’s “rule out anything infectious”). Key points missed: (a) the doctor’s self-isolation instruction as part of the rationale/urgency to contain a transmissible infection; (b) influenza being raised only after COVID rule-out discussion and after learning she did not get a flu shot (sequencing and flu-shot context). Overall, about half to two-thirds of the Gold rationale is captured.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims are supported by the transcript: COVID swab ordered [D-53]; patient has fever and sore throat [P-1]; husband has similar symptoms [P-19]; doctor states COVID is first thing to rule out if husband has it and patient has it [D-53]; doctor emphasizes ruling out infectious causes [D-53]. No clear hallucinated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question: identifies the diagnostic test and provides reasons for prioritizing COVID-19 over influenza. No substantial irrelevant content."
