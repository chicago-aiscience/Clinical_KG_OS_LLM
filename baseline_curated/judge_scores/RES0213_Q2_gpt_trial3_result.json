  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all three OTC products the patient tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer) and accurately reports the patient’s assessment that they “hasn’t really helped very much” (i.e., minimal/ineffective relief). It also correctly identifies the only routine supplement as a multivitamin. No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It includes the key items asked in the question: OTC medications tried for chest pain (all three) and the routine supplement (multivitamin), plus the reported lack of effectiveness. It does not include the Gold Answer’s additional contextual points (no prescription meds; stress-management behaviors; smoking reduction), though these are not strictly required to answer the question as posed. Minor omission: it doesn’t explicitly state that the multivitamin is the only ongoing routine item or that there are no other meds besides it.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate citations ([P-6] and [P-25]). No apparent hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on OTC medications/supplements and effectiveness of the pain-relief attempts, which directly answers the question without extraneous content."
