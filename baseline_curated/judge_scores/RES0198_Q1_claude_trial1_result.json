  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain information about the character of nasal discharge, when in fact [P-5] clearly states 'It's mostly clear.' More critically, it claims there is 'no evidence' that related symptoms were denied, when the transcript explicitly shows the patient denied cough [P-4], post-nasal drip [P-6], sore throat/shortness of breath/fevers/chills [P-7], and loss of taste/smell [P-16]. These are major omissions that directly contradict the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 30% of the key information. It correctly identifies the stuffy and runny nose symptoms and their duration, but completely fails to mention: (1) the clear character of discharge explicitly stated in [P-5], (2) the temporal progression from stuffy to runny [P-3], (3) all the explicitly denied symptoms (cough, post-nasal drip, sore throat, shortness of breath, fevers/chills, loss of taste/smell), and (4) additional pertinent negatives like headache, nausea, chest pain, etc.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer makes claims that are contradicted by the transcript. It states the character of discharge is not described when [P-5] clearly documents 'mostly clear.' It claims no evidence of symptom denials when multiple denials are explicitly documented in [P-4], [P-6], [P-7], and [P-16]. While the initial symptom description is grounded in the transcript, the false negative claims about missing information constitute significant unfaithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question's three components (nasal symptoms, discharge character, and denied symptoms), though it provides incorrect information for two of them. The content is focused on the question without tangents, but the inaccurate claims about missing information make it misleading rather than helpful."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the basic nasal symptoms (congestion and rhinorrhea) but fails critically in two major areas: it incorrectly claims the discharge character is not documented when [P-5] states 'mostly clear,' and it entirely misses all explicitly denied symptoms (cough, post-nasal drip, sore throat, loss of taste/smell, etc.) that are clearly documented in [P-4], [P-6], [P-7], and [P-16]. The answer covers less than one-third of the required information and makes false claims about the transcript content, resulting in significant inaccuracy and incompleteness."
