  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it claims that the specific frequency of Ventolin use was not stated, whereas the transcript [P-12] explicitly states it was used '10 times this past week'. It correctly identifies the inhalers (Ventolin, Spiriva), the non-respiratory drug (Atorvastatin), and the discontinued medication (diuretic).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses the key numerical value for Ventolin usage (10 times), which was a specific requirement of the prompt. It covers the medication list and the discontinued drug correctly.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the frequency of Ventolin use was 'not stated' is a hallucination/error, as the information is clearly present in the provided transcript [P-12].",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, although it provides an incorrect/negative response to the frequency component."
