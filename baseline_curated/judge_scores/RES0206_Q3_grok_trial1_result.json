  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies key symptoms from the transcript supporting both COPD exacerbation (worsening dyspnea, increased cough and sputum volume) and respiratory infection (fever, sick contact, purulent sputum), aligning with the Gold Answer's core facts. Minor discrepancies include categorizing purulent sputum primarily under COPD rather than infection (Gold places color under infection, volume under COPD), adding 'acute onset' as infection-specific (not emphasized in Gold), and general claims like 'COPD does not typically cause fever' which are plausible but not directly from Gold or transcript framing. No major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: COPD symptoms (increased cough, sputum volume, dyspnea [P-1]); infection symptoms (fever [P-9], sick contact [P-20], sputum color [P-1]); distinguishing role of fever and sputum. Missed: sinus pressure [P-12], mild headache [P-14], specific decreased exercise tolerance/walking the dog [P-4], doctor's exact assessment quote [D-43], excluded triggers (no dust/smoke [P-38], consistent inhaler use [P-26]), patient's past pattern [P-3], note on no objective findings. Covers ~60-70% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: symptoms and citations [P-1, P-9, P-20] directly from transcript. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'provided knowledge graph' (absent from transcript/prompt), 'incubation and progression typical of an infection', 'physically obstructing [airways]', 'COPD itself does not typically cause a fever' (general knowledge, not transcript-grounded). Multiple added interpretations reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around symptoms supporting dual assessment and distinguishing role of sputum/fever, using sections matching question; minor off-topic elements like knowledge graph but overall perfectly focused."
