  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the reflux medication (Tums) and the reasons for discontinuing the previous prescription. However, it completely omits the medication Avodart and the medical condition it treats (enlarged prostate), which are explicitly mentioned in the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the reflux-related portion of the question well (Tums, reflux condition, discontinuation of old med, and the dietary reason). However, it misses approximately 33% of the key information from the Gold Answer: specifically, the mention of Avodart and the enlarged prostate condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is directly supported by the transcript (P-26, P-27). There are no hallucinations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the parts of the question it identifies, but by omitting one of the two medications the patient is currently taking, it only partially satisfies the prompt's request for 'what medications' (plural)."
