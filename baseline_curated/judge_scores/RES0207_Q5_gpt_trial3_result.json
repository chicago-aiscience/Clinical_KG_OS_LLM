  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main risk factors in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose) and (2) hereditary predisposition (maternal history of epilepsy). It also correctly links the family history to genetic predisposition for the patient’s epilepsy diagnosis. However, it introduces an unsupported assertion that “the knowledge graph” establishes direct causality (both for missed dose → seizure and family history → epilepsy), which is not stated in the transcript or Gold Answer and overstates the evidentiary basis. These are minor-to-moderate issues but do not overturn the main clinical conclusions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: missed antiseizure medication (Keppra), patient attribution that missing meds likely triggered the seizure, and maternal history of epilepsy implying genetic predisposition. Key points missed or underdeveloped: the specific reason the dose was missed (daughter’s birthday/routine disruption) and the contextual point that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent. Overall coverage is good but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in transcript quotes (P-9, P-23, P-26). However, repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and claims that it “establishes a causal link” are not present in the transcript and thus constitute hallucinated/unsupported content. The rest is faithful to the provided dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on hereditary and medication-related risk factors and explains how family history relates to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis. No meaningful irrelevant tangents."
