  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists a fuller constellation: dry cough, persistent headache, GI symptoms (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea), fatigue, and loss of smell as overlapping with COVID-19. Generated correctly identifies headache, cough, and loss of smell as part of the suspicion per [D-52], with accurate citations, and correctly IDs anosmia as characteristic; however, it omits GI symptoms and fatigue (prominent in patient's initial report [P-1] and Gold), does not specify dry cough, and introduces no contradictions but has minor discrepancies in symptom coverage.",
    "completeness": "Covers: doctor's suspicion and [D-52] quote, headache details [P-5], cough [P-1], loss of smell [P-24], anosmia as characteristic. Misses: dry cough specification [P-12], full GI details [P-28,P-32], fatigue [P-19], doctor's specific question on smell/taste [D-24], alternative viral illness [D-52], pertinent negatives (no fever [P-18], no runny nose [P-23], no aches [P-27]). Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: symptoms and citations match transcript ([P-1],[P-5],[P-12 implied],[P-24],[D-52]). Doctor's overlap statement grounds suspicion. However, 'knowledge graph explicitly links loss of smell to DIAGNOSIS of covid-19' is entirely hallucinated—not in transcript or any provided source. Minor other plausibilities, but this fabrication deducts points.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses both parts of the question: specifies combination (headache, cough, loss of smell) leading to COVID suspicion, and identifies loss of smell as characteristic symptom vs. other virals; structured with bullets, no off-topic content."
