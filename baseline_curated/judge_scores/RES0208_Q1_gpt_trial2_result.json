  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer includes several symptoms that are accurately supported by the transcript (weak/run-down [P-1, P-2], decreased intake/appetite [P-2], generalized aches [P-20], headaches not worse than usual [P-11], minimal coughing [P-8]). However, it mischaracterizes “feels dry like it’s on its way” as a “dry throat sensation,” whereas the patient was describing a dry cough sensation rather than throat dryness [P-8]. It also misplaces headaches under “Sensory Changes,” while the Gold Answer’s sensory changes are taste/smell loss. Overall, facts included are mostly accurate but with a notable misinterpretation and category error.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer items covered: weakness [P-2], decreased appetite/reduced eating [P-2], generalized myalgias/aches [P-20], mild baseline headaches [P-11], minimal cough [P-8]. Key items missed: loss of taste [P-4], diminished smell [P-6], newness of taste change [P-5], sore throat starting [P-9], subjective fever/warmth the day prior [P-4], explicit denial of runny nose/congestion [P-10], and the nuance that cough was starting/“on its way” [P-7, P-8]. This is well under full coverage (roughly ~40–50% of the Gold Answer points).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references. The main issue is the “dry throat sensation” wording, which is not explicitly stated; the transcript supports a dry cough sensation rather than throat dryness [P-8]. Otherwise, there are no major hallucinated symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question (additional symptoms beyond dyspnea/fatigue across sensory/URI/musculoskeletal/constitutional domains). It does not add irrelevant content, but it under-delivers on the requested domains by omitting major sensory and URI symptoms."

  "summary": "The answer is mostly transcript-grounded and relevant but misses several central reported symptoms (notably taste/smell loss, fever, sore throat, and denial of congestion) and slightly misinterprets the “dry” sensation as throat-related rather than cough-related."
