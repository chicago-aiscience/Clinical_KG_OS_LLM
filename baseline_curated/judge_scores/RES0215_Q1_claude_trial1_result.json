  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the three main respiratory symptoms reported (wheezing, cough, shortness of breath) and correctly identifies wheezing as the earliest symptom. The chronological distinction that the cough appeared more recently is also correctly noted. All facts align with the Gold Answer and source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the core respiratory symptoms and correctly identifies the earliest symptom. However, it lacks several details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the specific context of becoming 'quite out of breath' during playing tag [P-3], (2) the mother's characterization of difficulty catching breath during episodes [P-32], (3) the explicit denial of cyanosis, (4) the non-productive nature of the cough [P-31], and (5) the observation that the child 'looks fine otherwise' [P-9]. These omissions reduce completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer appropriately references [P-1], [P-2], and [P-43] for wheezing symptoms, correctly cites the timing language, and does not introduce any hallucinated content. The answer stays grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: what respiratory symptoms were reported at presentation and which were earliest to appear. The response is well-focused with no irrelevant content, organized clearly to answer each component of the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually correct information about the respiratory symptoms and correctly identifies the earliest symptoms, with all claims properly grounded in the transcript. However, it lacks several supporting details present in the Gold Answer, including the contextual description of breathlessness during activity, the explicit denial of cyanosis, the non-productive nature of the cough, and the observation that the child appeared well otherwise. While the core answer is accurate and relevant, these omissions affect its completeness."
