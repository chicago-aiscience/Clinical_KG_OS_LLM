  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the doctor's plan, self-care measures, and alleviating factors are missing from the transcript. However, the transcript explicitly includes the doctor's plan to consult a supervising physician [D-43], self-care measures like Tylenol [P-14] and 'taking it easy' [P-10], and alleviating factors such as expectorating sputum [P-13] and Tylenol [P-14]. The only partially correct section is the aggravating factors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover three of the four major components requested in the prompt: the doctor's plan, self-care measures, and alleviating factors. It only provides details on aggravating factors, missing approximately 75% of the key information provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of information. It states that certain details are 'not present in the text' when they are clearly stated in the provided transcript. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not part of the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer follows the structure of the question but fails to provide the relevant information for most sections, instead providing a meta-commentary that the information is missing."
