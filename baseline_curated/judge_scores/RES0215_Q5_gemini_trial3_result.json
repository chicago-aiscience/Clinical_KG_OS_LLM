  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer regarding the relationships between the patient's history and symptoms. It correctly identifies the link between allergies and airway sensitivity, viral infections and hyperresponsiveness, carpets as irritants, and cold air as a trigger. However, it includes an artifact referring to a 'Knowledge Graph' and specific semantic logic strings ('[MEDICAL_HISTORY]...--[CAUSES]-->...') which are not part of the provided source material, indicating a minor discrepancy in how it presents the facts.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all four primary factors requested in the prompt (allergies, infections, carpets, cold weather) and correctly synthesizes their impact. It misses the 'negative' environmental factors (smoking, pets, wood-burning stoves) that the gold answer included to provide a more comprehensive environmental profile, but these were not explicitly requested in the prompt. It also acknowledges the nighttime symptoms and relief with rest mentioned in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-15], [P-35], [P-38]). However, it contains a clear hallucination regarding the source material by referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' and 'KG Correlation' which were not provided in the context. While the clinical logic derived from these is accurate, the attribution is unfaithful to the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured to directly address the question. It breaks down each factor and explains its relationship to the patient's respiratory pattern as requested."
