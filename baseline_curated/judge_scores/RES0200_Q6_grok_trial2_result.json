  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer regarding labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab), imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (O2 saturation and supplemental O2 if needed), and therapeutics (steroids, antibiotics as new; bronchodilators continued, naming Ventolin/Spiriva). Minor discrepancy: omits blood pressure monitoring mentioned in Gold from [D-37]. Core facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers 100% of key points from [D-52] (all labs, COVID swab, chest X-ray, O2 monitoring/supplemental O2, bronchodilators continuation, steroids, antibiotics). Misses only the additional BP monitoring from [D-37] (one minor point), achieving ~95% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: labs/imaging/monitoring/interventions from [D-52]; bronchodilators (Ventolin/Spiriva) from [P-11/D-11]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response into exact categories requested (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics with new/continued distinction); no off-topic content."
