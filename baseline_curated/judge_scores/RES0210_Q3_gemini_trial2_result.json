  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core clinical features (productive cough, purulent/hemoptytic sputum, fever, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain) and explains their significance in the context of pneumonia. It correctly cites the transcript sections for these symptoms. The medical explanation for pleuritic pain (inflammation of the pleura due to underlying infection) is accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most of the key points but misses a few details present in the Gold Answer: 1) It omits the mention of chills [P-9], which is a significant systemic sign of infection. 2) It fails to mention the patient's long-term smoking history [P-37, P-38] as a predisposing factor for LRTI. 3) It does not specifically highlight that the chest pain is constant even at rest [P-20, P-21], which was mentioned in the question prompt and the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly faithful to the transcript. However, it hallucinates a source of information by repeatedly referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' and 'Knowledge Graph data' which were not provided in the context (the prompt only provided a transcript). While the medical logic is sound, attributing it to a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' is a hallucination of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the question by breaking down the specific findings that point toward pneumonia and providing a clear explanation of how pleuritic pain supports the diagnosis."
