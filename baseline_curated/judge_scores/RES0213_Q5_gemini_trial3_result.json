  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer captures the core facts regarding the father's heart attack and the psychosocial stressors. However, it incorrectly asserts that the transcript does not confirm current active smoking, whereas the patient explicitly states she smokes 5 cigarettes a day (P-14).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer, including the paternal grandfather's history, the patient's starting age for smoking, specific quantitative details of her smoking history (10 cigarettes reduced to 5), the fact that she lives alone in London, and her recent nervousness regarding running.",
    "faithfulness": "The response hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information, which is not present in the provided transcript. It also inaccurately interprets the smoking status despite the patient providing a daily count.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, focusing directly on the three factors requested and providing a logical explanation of their interactions."
