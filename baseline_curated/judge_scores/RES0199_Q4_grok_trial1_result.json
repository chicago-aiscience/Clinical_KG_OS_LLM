  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the condition to rule out (COVID-19), the diagnostic test (swab), the turnaround time (24-48 hours), and the alternative diagnosis (another viral illness), all matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. It correctly notes symptom overlap stated by the doctor. Additions like specific symptoms and supportive management (hydration) are consistent with the transcript (headache [P-3], dry cough [P-12], loss of smell [P-24], hydration/supportive care [D-52]), with no contradictions or factual errors compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Rule out COVID-19 (covered); 2) Swab test with 24-48h TAT (covered); 3) Isolate 14 days (missed); 4) If positive, public health contact tracing (missed); 5) If negative, another viral illness (covered); 6) Supportive management either way (partially covered via hydration reference, but misses full details like nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol). Covers core question elements (condition, test/TAT, alternative) but misses ~30-40% of Gold's details.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims (COVID-19, swab, 24-48h, viral illness) verifiable in [D-52]. Symptoms (headache, cough, smell) verifiable in transcript. However, multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements: 'knowledge graph' links (e.g., symptoms linked in KG, hydration KG triple) not present in transcript; these are fabricated additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question with bullet points matching each part (condition, test, TAT, alternative diagnosis). Minor tangents (symptom list, KG references) but remains focused on doctor's reasoning and instructions."
