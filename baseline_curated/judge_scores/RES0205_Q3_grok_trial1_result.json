  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and states the test was negative, matching the Gold Answer. It accurately covers the patient's hospital work, persistent cough, evolution to dry cough, resolving flu-like symptoms, and coworker concerns as prompting factors. Minor discrepancy: claims the cough 'worsened into a dry cough,' but transcript indicates it changed from productive to dry with stable intensity (P-6, P-7), not explicitly worsening; citation to P-35 for worsening is inaccurate as P-35 discusses test and work fears. Core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: diagnosis (COVID-19), patient disclosure of test (P-35), hospital work (P-17 cited, aligns with P-17/P-34), symptoms (flu-like resolving, persistent cough - P-14), coworker fears (P-35), test negative (P-35). Missed or partially covered: specific job as 'clerk' (P-34), PPE use despite care (P-17), exact test timing at symptom onset two weeks ago (P-36), staying home post-test (P-36). Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable in transcript: hospital worker (P-17, P-34), cough persistence (P-2), dry cough (P-5, P-6), flu-like symptoms resolved (P-14), coworkers scared (P-35), test negative (P-35). Minor issue: 'worsened' not directly supported (intensity same per P-7), and citation P-35/P-2/P-5 loosely applied for worsening. No major hallucinations; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by specifying the diagnosis (COVID-19), listing prompting evidence with citations, and stating test result. No off-topic content; structured response mirrors question components."
