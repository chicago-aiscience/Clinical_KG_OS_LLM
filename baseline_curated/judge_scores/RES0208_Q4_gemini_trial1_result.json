  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It identifies sore throat as a negated symptom but then admits it was confirmed. Most importantly, it claims the loss of smell was absent to help narrow the differential, whereas the transcript [P-6] shows the patient confirmed experiencing it ('yeah, kind of'). It also misattributes the absence of chest pain to differentiating from pneumonia rather than cardiac causes as noted in the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the vast majority of negated symptoms mentioned in the gold answer, including vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and numbness/tingling. Even though the question specifically prompts for chest pain, palpitations, and nausea, the generated answer fails to include palpitations and nausea in its list of negated symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinations the absence of the loss of smell, which contradicts the transcript where the patient acknowledges a change in smell. It also claims the patient 'denied' a cough, whereas the patient said it felt like one was 'starting' and 'on its way' [P-8], making it a weak or partial negation at best.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it attempts to address the differentiation logic, but by failing to list the specific symptoms asked for and getting the facts wrong regarding the symptoms present, it fails to provide a helpful clinical assessment."
