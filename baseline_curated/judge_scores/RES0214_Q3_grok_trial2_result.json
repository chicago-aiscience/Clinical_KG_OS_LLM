  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies fever and sore throat as the specific symptoms cited by the doctor in [D-53] for suspecting infectious etiology like COVID-19, matching the Gold Answer's explicit reference. It correctly notes the patient's confirmation in [P-1]. For influenza, it precisely captures the vaccination history inquiry in [D-53] leading to the differential in [D-54], consistent with Gold. No factual errors or contradictions, though it omits broader context like epidemiology and [D-24] summary, which are not central to the 'specific' symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: fever/sore throat [D-53] (yes), vaccination history/no flu shot prompting influenza [D-53/P-53/D-54] (yes, implied 'no' via context). Missed: broader symptom cluster [D-24], husband's similar symptoms/epidemiology [D-53]. Covers core specifics (80-99%) but not all supportive details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: fever/sore throat in [P-1]/[D-53]; flu shot question [D-53] leading to influenza mention [D-54]. Patient's 'no' [P-53] supports implication. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to the two-part question with bolded sections matching 'presenting symptoms' and 'vaccination history', no tangents or off-topic content."
