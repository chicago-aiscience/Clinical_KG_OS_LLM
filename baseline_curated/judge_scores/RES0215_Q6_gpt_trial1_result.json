  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reproduces the doctor’s stated immediate plan in D-58: (1) perform a physical exam, (2) talk to/consult the physician, and (3) return to discuss next steps. It does not introduce incorrect tests, treatments, or follow-up actions. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Immediate next steps: Captures the three main steps (exam → consult physician → return to discuss next steps), but omits that no specific tests/imaging/medications were mentioned and omits the doctor’s invitation for parent questions before proceeding. Environmental assessment: Mentions only carpets/new carpets, but misses other assessed home factors (household smoking, pets, wood-burning fireplace/stove, air-filter changes) and the home/living context (townhouse; lives with mother and father). Overall coverage is well under half of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are directly supported by the transcript (D-58 for the plan; P-54 for carpets). No hallucinated examinations, tests, referrals, or environmental exposures are added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic (next steps and environmental factors). However, because it substantially underreports the environmental factors assessed, it only partially answers the full question."

  "summary": "The plan elements included are accurate and transcript-grounded, but the answer is markedly incomplete—especially regarding the home environmental factors assessed and a couple of plan-related details."
