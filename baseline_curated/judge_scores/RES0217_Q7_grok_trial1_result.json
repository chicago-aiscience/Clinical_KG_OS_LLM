  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, discovery and bringing the tick) and comparison (prior bullseye rash and antibiotics ~10 years ago, prior tick more swollen, current smaller/less engorged, current local symptoms without rash). Minor discrepancies include omitting the patient's uncertainty about attachment timing, hope it was from hiking not gardening, precise discovery due to soreness 'earlier today', doctor's >72-hour estimate, and exact engorgement contrasts (e.g., 'little grape'). No major errors or contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: hiking Fri [P-1], gardening Sat [P-1], brought tick in container [P-1], current tick small [P-4/D-5], prior ~10yr bullseye rash + antibiotics [P-3], prior swollen tick, current less swollen/not as bad [P-3], current local red/tender/sore behind knee no rash [P-1/P-6]. Missed: uncertainty/hope on source [P-1], soreness prompting discovery 'earlier today' [P-1], embedded in knee joint/crease [P-1], doctor's 72hr estimate [D-6], doctor's engorgement confirmation [D-4]. Covers ~70% of Gold's specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1] for activities/location/symptoms, [P-3] for prior comparison, [D-5] for small tick). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; descriptions like 'stuck pretty good', 'skin sore not joint' match P-1 exactly.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's two parts (timeline from Fri-Sat-discovery-presentation; comparison of current symptoms/engorgement vs. prior bullseye episode), with no off-topic content."
