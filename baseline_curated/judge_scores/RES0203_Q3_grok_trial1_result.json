  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, mild dry cough) matching the Gold Answer, correctly cites the doctor's connection in D-39 and the swab test order in D-39. No factual errors or contradictions; minor omission of supportive details like patient worry or absence of other symptoms does not affect core accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: combination of three symptoms (loss of smell, taste, dry cough); doctor's explicit connection in D-39 ('symptoms consistent with common covid symptoms'); ordered swab test in D-39. Missed: patient initially raising COVID concern in P-1; confirmation of absent symptoms (fever P-10, etc.); 'pretty well' summary D-16; narrow profile rationale; self-isolation instruction D-39. Covers core ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly grounded in transcript: symptoms from P-1 (and elaborated P-4, etc.); exact phrasing from D-39 for connection and swab test, with accurate citations. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; 'in turn [D-39]' likely a minor typo but does not fabricate content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by specifying the symptom combination, quoting the doctor's connection to COVID-19 suspicion, and identifying the swab test method, with no off-topic content."
