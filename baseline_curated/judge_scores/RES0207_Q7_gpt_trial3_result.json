  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most timeline facts match the Gold Answer and transcript: seizure occurred “last night,” patient felt fine and went to bed, morning onset of sudden SOB with dry cough, and temperature 37.4°C checked that morning with decision to come in due to symptoms. Minor issue: it presents the missed dose as a more definite causal link (“Consequently… likely led”) than the transcript supports (patient says they “think that might have” contributed). No direct contradictions of the Gold Answer, but it slightly over-interprets causality and adds non-transcript framing (“knowledge graph”).",
    "completeness": "Covers: seizure last night; fine after and went to bed; missed Keppra dose; morning sudden SOB; dry cough; temperature check 37.4°C; decided to seek care because of symptoms. Misses key Gold Answer elements: (1) the daughter’s birthday celebration disrupting the usual dinner routine as the reason for missing Keppra (P-24); (2) the estimate that respiratory symptoms began ~3 hours before the consultation (P-11); (3) the patient’s explicit uncertainty about whether seizure and SOB are related (P-8) as part of the timeline/context. Overall ~60–75% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly grounded in cited transcript lines. However, references to a “knowledge graph” and explicit causal relationship notation (e.g., “[CAUSES]-->”) are not present in the transcript and represent added, unverifiable scaffolding. The causal assertion is plausible and suggested by the patient but is stronger than stated. Still, the clinical event sequence itself is largely faithful.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the requested reconstruction (seizure timing, respiratory symptom onset, temperature check, and decision to seek care) with minimal tangential content. The only mild distraction is the “knowledge graph” mention, but it does not derail the timeline."
