{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer regarding the use of Reactine for seasonal allergies and the absence of prescribed medications. It correctly identifies Reactine as an over-the-counter antihistamine.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention that no treatment is given for the current respiratory episodes (which resolve on their own with rest) and omits the detail that past infections over the last two years did not require antibiotics. These were specific parts of the question's scope.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript, correctly citing sections [P-35] and [P-36]. It does not introduce any information not found in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant to the question, though its focus is narrowed to medications she *is* taking rather than including the 'no treatment' status for the current episodes requested in the prompt."
