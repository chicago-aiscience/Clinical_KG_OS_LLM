  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly frames the symptoms under a header of 'Evolution and Worsening'. However, the transcript and Gold Answer explicitly state that the symptoms have been 'staying the same' and 'pretty steady' [P-2, P-3]. It also fails to mention that 'getting up out of a chair' is a specific exacerbating factor mentioned by the patient.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points requested in the prompt: it does not state whether symptoms are getting better, worse, or staying the same; it fails to provide the specific change in the walking routine (reducing from two walks to one); and it misses the specific trigger of getting out of a chair.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims the symptoms 'evolved into a significant respiratory issue,' which is an interpretation not supported by the transcript where the patient says the condition is 'steady.' While it correctly cites symptoms like hoarseness and phlegm, its overall framing of 'evolution' contradicts the patient's own assessment of the timeline.",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally relevant to the patient's chest tightness but fails to directly answer the specific sub-questions in the prompt regarding the progression (better/worse/same) and the specific impact on the walking routine frequency."
