  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key symptom cluster (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness) as typical of asthma and links increased bronchodilator reliance to worsening control. It is broadly consistent with the Gold Answer that this presentation supports asthma worsening rather than a new respiratory illness.\n\nHowever, there are minor accuracy/citation issues:\n- It cites chest tightness as a “present concern” using [D-20], which is the clinician’s question; the confirming evidence is actually [P-20] (“Yes”). The conclusion (chest tightness present) is still correct, but the citation is off.\n- It repeatedly references a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer and implies an external source.\n\nNo major contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that ARE covered:\n- Classic asthma symptom profile: dry cough, SOB, wheeze, chest tightness.\n- Known asthma diagnosis since age 8.\n- Triggers consistent with asthma (exercise, cold air; mentions pollen as well).\n- Increased bronchodilator use (qualitatively) as a marker of worsening control.\n\nKey points from the Gold Answer that are MISSING or under-specified:\n- The specific quantitative escalation in reliever use from ~once every two weeks to 5–6 times/week (P-8) (the question explicitly highlights this).\n- Wheezing occurring even more frequently than bronchodilator use (D-17, P-17).\n- Bronchodilator provides relief (P-1) as evidence of reversible obstruction.\n- The negative infectious/alternative-etiology screen (no URI symptoms, no sick contacts, no fever, no loss of taste/smell, no productive cough, etc.), which the Gold Answer uses to argue against a new respiratory condition.\n\nOverall, it captures the general asthma-exacerbation argument but omits several Gold Answer supports—especially the quantitative inhaler change and the infection screen.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (symptoms, asthma history, exercise/cold triggers, increased inhaler use in general). \n\nFaithfulness issues:\n- “According to the knowledge graph…” is not supported by the transcript and introduces an external, unverifiable element.\n- Chest tightness is attributed to [D-20] (a question) rather than the patient confirmation [P-20].\n\nThese are relatively minor; the answer is largely transcript-consistent.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on explaining why the symptom combination and increased bronchodilator use support worsening asthma rather than a new condition. It includes some extra context (family history, ‘knowledge graph’ mentions), but it stays mostly on-topic and addresses the intent of the question."
