  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the father's heart attack in his 50s, the smoking history (18 years old start, 10 cigarettes/day for 2 years, reduced to 5/day), and the psychosocial stressors (Masters thesis, living alone, deadline pressure). All citations are accurate to the transcript exchanges.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) family history details including father's heart attack and current cardiac care, (2) smoking history with specific quantities and quit attempts, (3) psychosocial stressors including academic pressure and social isolation, and (4) the patient's explicit connections between these factors and her concern. It also adds relevant context about symptom triggers and anxiety manifestations that enhance understanding.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The Generated Answer properly quotes from exchanges [P-8], [P-13], [P-19], [P-29], and others. It does not hallucinate facts and stays grounded in the source material. The interpretation of symptom-stress connections is supported by the patient's own statements about when pain occurs.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all aspects of the question: how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors each contribute to and interact with her concern, and provides specific details from the consultation to illustrate these connections. The structured breakdown with numbered sections precisely matches the question's requirements."
