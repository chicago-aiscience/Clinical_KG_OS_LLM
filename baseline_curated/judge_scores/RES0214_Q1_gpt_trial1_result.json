  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The first part (reported symptoms) matches the Gold Answer: fever x3 days, sore throat persistent, stuffy nose preceding fever, and muscle aches. However, the second part is factually incorrect: the transcript *does* contain explicit denials for cough ([P-10]), headache ([P-8]), neck stiffness ([P-7]), nausea/vomiting ([P-5]), and difficulty swallowing ([P-24]/[P-25]/[P-26]). The Generated Answer incorrectly states these denials cannot be verified, contradicting both the transcript and the Gold Answer. It also introduces an incorrect detail about the doctor asking about ear pain, which is not in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Reported symptoms: includes all four key symptoms from the Gold Answer (100% of that component). Denials: fails to list any of the explicitly denied clinically significant symptoms (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea/vomiting, difficulty swallowing) and also omits other negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer (e.g., abdominal pain, rash/skin changes, bowel changes). Overall it captures roughly half of the Gold Answer’s required elements (symptoms yes; denials no).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: (1) the claim that denials for cough/headache/neck stiffness/nausea/difficulty swallowing are not present is directly contradicted by the transcript; (2) mention of ear pain being asked about is not supported. While the listed positive symptoms are grounded, the denial section contains major unfaithful assertions.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to answer both parts of the question (reported symptoms and denied symptoms). However, it fails to actually provide the denied symptoms list and instead states they cannot be verified. Still, it remains on-topic without unrelated tangents."
