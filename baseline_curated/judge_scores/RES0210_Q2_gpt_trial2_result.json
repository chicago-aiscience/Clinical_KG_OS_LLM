  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the single prescribed medication, Lipitor, and correctly links it to treatment of high cholesterol. However, it incorrectly states that no over-the-counter medications were mentioned. The transcript explicitly states the patient took Tylenol at home and that it “helps a little bit” [P-14]. Therefore, the OTC medication list and the reported OTC effectiveness are wrong, which is a major factual error relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer:\n- Lipitor (atorvastatin) for high cholesterol and that it is the only prescription med ✅ (included)\n- Tylenol (acetaminophen) OTC for feverish/unwell symptoms ❌ (missed)\n- Effectiveness of Tylenol: “helps a little bit” (partial relief) ❌ (missed)\n- Non-medication measure: expectorating/clearing “gunk” helps temporarily ❌ (missed)\n- No other meds mentioned ✅/❌ (implicitly claimed, but incorrectly because Tylenol was missed)\nOverall, it covers only the Lipitor portion and omits the rest of the required medication/effectiveness information.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not well-grounded in the transcript because it claims no OTC medications were mentioned, contradicting [P-14]. It also references “knowledge graph data,” which is not part of the provided transcript and is therefore an unsupported addition. These issues reduce faithfulness substantially.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address the question (medications, indications, OTC effectiveness). However, it fails to capture the OTC medication and its effectiveness, so while on-topic, it does not successfully answer the full question."

  "summary": "The answer correctly notes Lipitor for high cholesterol but incorrectly states no OTC medication was used, missing Tylenol and its reported partial benefit, and includes unsupported references, leading to low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness despite being generally on-topic."
