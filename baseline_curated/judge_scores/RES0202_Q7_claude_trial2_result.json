  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains all the key facts from the Gold Answer and is fully consistent with it. Both describe: (1) Wednesday - child fine initially, dry cough at night; (2) Thursday - cough worsened, child tired; (3) Friday - cough continued worsening, fever emerged (100.1-101°F), decreased appetite, possible taste loss. The Generated Answer accurately represents the timeline and symptoms without any factual errors.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: the three-day progression, Wednesday onset with dry cough at night, Thursday's worsening cough and fatigue, Friday's fever emergence with specific temperature, and Friday's additional symptoms (decreased appetite, possible taste loss). While the Gold Answer includes additional details like the runny nose and the mother's summary statement from [P-12], and the correction about days from [P-4], the Generated Answer captures all essential clinical information about the illness evolution.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The Wednesday night cough onset [P-1], Thursday's worsening and tiredness [P-1], Friday's continued worsening [P-1], fever temperature [P-1][P-2], decreased appetite [P-15], and taste loss [P-17] all have proper citations. No hallucinated information is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's specific requirements: when the cough first appeared (Wednesday night), how it changed in severity (worsened Thursday, continued worsening Friday), when fever emerged (Friday), and when other symptoms appeared (fatigue Thursday, decreased appetite and taste loss Friday). It maintains perfect focus on the day-by-day evolution requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a highly accurate and relevant response to the question about the child's illness evolution. It correctly captures the three-day progression with precise timing of symptom onset and changes, supported by appropriate citations. The only minor limitation is the omission of some supplementary details present in the Gold Answer (runny nose, mother's summary statement, timeline correction), which prevents a perfect completeness score. However, all core clinical information is accurately represented."
