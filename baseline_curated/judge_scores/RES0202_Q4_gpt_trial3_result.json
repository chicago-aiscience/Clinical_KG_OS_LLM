  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies **asthma** as the condition that would have been added to the differential if the presentation were different, and correctly identifies **the presence of fever** as the key finding that led the doctor to favor infection rather than asthma. However, it incorrectly attributes the asthma statement to **[D-44]** (the asthma comment is actually in **[D-45]**), and it adds an unsupported claim that a “knowledge graph” indicates fever rules out asthma. These issues are secondary to the core clinical content, which matches the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It includes the two key elements asked: (1) asthma would have been considered with cough/SOB without fever, and (2) fever is the specific finding that excluded asthma from the current workup. It does not include extra supporting context found in the Gold Answer (e.g., absence of wheeze, uncertainty about SOB, and the nuance that asthma isn’t permanently ruled out), but those are not strictly required to answer the question as posed.",
    "faithfulness": "There are notable grounding problems: the answer cites **[D-44]** for the asthma point even though the relevant quote is in **[D-45]**. It also references a “knowledge graph” and claims it provides evidence that fever rules out asthma, which is not present in the transcript. The fever itself is grounded in **[P-1]/[P-2]** and the doctor’s infection framing is grounded in **[D-45]**, but the citation error and added non-transcript justification reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question (which condition would have been added, and which clinical finding excluded it) and does not include major irrelevant tangents."
