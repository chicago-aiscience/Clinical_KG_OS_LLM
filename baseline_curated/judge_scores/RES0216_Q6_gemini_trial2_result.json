  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the assessment (asthma) and the differential (cardiac ischemia). It accurately describes the physical exam components and the first-step intervention. However, it misses the distinction made in the Gold Answer regarding the patient needing to 'obtain' rescue puffers because they currently lack them (as per P-17/P-18), rather than just using existing ones. It also omits the doctor's mention of consulting with a supervising physician.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points: the assessment (asthma vs cardiac), physical exam (lungs), initial treatment (rescue puffers/therapeutic trial), and contingency (reassess/new directions). It misses two specific details from the Gold Answer: 1) the specific need to obtain/refill the rescue puffer, and 2) the doctor's plan to consult with 'the doc' (supervising physician).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It correctly cites the doctor's focus on lungs [D-35] and the patient's report of asthma history [P-16, P-25]. The logic regarding cardiac ischemia is directly supported by D-36.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly relevant and structured according to the multi-part question asked."
