  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and their approximate durations, matching the Gold Answer. However, it contains significant factual errors by stating that the transcript 'does not provide specific information' on the cough's nature (productive vs. non-productive), despite explicit confirmation of a dry, non-productive cough ('dry cough' [D-5, P-5], 'no gunk' [D-6, P-6]). Similarly, it claims no details on nasal discharge appearance, contradicting the patient's description of it as 'pretty clear' [D-12, P-12]. It also omits that the cough 'stayed the same' [D-7, P-7], partially misrepresenting progression. These are core discrepancies on the exact question elements.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: two symptoms, cough duration (4-5 days [P-2]), runny nose duration (couple of days [P-11]). Partially covers cough progression (not improving, akin to 'stayed the same'). Missed: cough characterized as dry/non-productive/no gunk [D-5/P-5, D-6/P-6], stayed the same exactly [D-7/P-7], nasal discharge 'pretty clear' [D-12/P-12], never had dry cough like this/past runny noses shorter [P-24], pertinent negatives (no sore throat [P-9], no chest pain [P-15], no SOB/wheezing [P-28]). Covers approximately 25-30% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims of symptom presence and durations are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-2, P-11]. However, assertions that transcript lacks specifics on cough nature (productive/non-productive) and nasal discharge appearance are false and not grounded, as these are explicitly stated (dry cough, no gunk, pretty clear), representing hallucinated absences or oversights. No fabricated facts added beyond this.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured around the two symptoms, their characteristics (including attempted address of cough nature and nasal appearance), directly matching the question's focus on patient-reported respiratory symptoms without any off-topic content or tangents."
