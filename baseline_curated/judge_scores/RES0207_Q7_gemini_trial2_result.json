  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the sequence of clinical events. It correctly identifies the seizure on the evening before, the missed Keppra dose, the morning onset of respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath and dry cough), the temperature reading, and the decision to seek care. No factual inaccuracies were found compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses two specific details present in the Gold Answer: the context of the daughter's birthday celebration as the reason for the missed medication, and the specific 'three hours' duration mentioned by the patient regarding the onset of symptoms. It covers approximately 80% of the Gold Answer's detail.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript. While it refers to a 'knowledge graph' which was not explicitly part of the provided text, the clinical facts it cites (Keppra for epilepsy, missed dose leading to seizure) are all directly supported by the patient's statements in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the timeline requested. It organizes the events chronologically as instructed, avoiding unnecessary tangents beyond the clinical timeline and its immediate causes."
