  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the medication (Keppra) and the chronic condition (epilepsy). It also correctly states that the patient forgot the dose, which matches the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the core 'specific circumstance' requested. While it mentions the patient 'forgot,' it fails to mention the daughter's birthday celebration or the change in dinner routine, which are the specific details provided in the Gold Answer and the transcript (P-24).",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made are fully supported by the transcript and cited correctly (P-23 and P-9). No hallucinations were present.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but incomplete. It addresses the medication part well but provides a very superficial response to the 'specific circumstance' part of the question."
