  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor's plan and self-care measures are not present in the transcript, directly contradicting the Gold Answer which cites [D-43] for the plan to discuss with the supervising physician and [P-14, P-13, P-10] for Tylenol, expectoration, and rest; it partially captures aggravating factors like exertion [P-10] and deep breathing [P-18] but misattributes coughing effect to throat rawness [P-15] instead of chest pain worsening [P-19], and completely misses alleviating factors, leading to significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exertion [P-10, P-11] and deep breathing [P-18] as aggravating (partial); missed entirely: doctor's plan [D-43], all self-care (Tylenol [P-14], expectoration [P-13], resting [P-10]), coughing worsening chest pain [P-19], no other triggers [P-12], all alleviating factors (Tylenol, expectoration, rest), and clinical implications; covers roughly 20-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims of no doctor's plan or self-care are not verifiable and false as [D-43], [P-14], [P-13], [P-10] exist; aggravating citations [P-10, P-15, P-18] are accurate but [P-15] misused for chest pain; mentions 'Knowledge Graph' not in transcript (hallucination); no alleviating despite evidence in [P-13, P-14]; multiple hallucinated absences.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the question's three parts (plan, self-care, aggra/allev), lists factors with citations, notes missing info; minor tangent with Knowledge Graph reference but overall focused on query."
