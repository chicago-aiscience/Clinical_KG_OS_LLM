  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the doctor's questions. It states that 'None of the specific symptoms from the examples provided... were explicitly asked about,' whereas the transcript shows the doctor asking about wheezing [D-7], chest pain [D-13], sore throat [D-14], chills [D-19], and GI complaints [D-22, D-23]. The gold answer correctly identifies these as pertinent negatives.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the symptoms reported by the mother (respiratory and systemic) well. However, it fails completely on the second half of the prompt regarding symptoms denied by the mother because it incorrectly assumes the questions weren't asked. It misses approximately 50% of the key points found in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer makes a false claim that the doctor did not ask about specific symptoms. Furthermore, it misinterprets the doctor's safety-netting instructions in [D-44] (listing symptoms to watch out for in the future) as diagnostic questions about current status that were 'denied' in [P-32], which was actually a response to a question about allergies.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer follows the structure of the prompt and addresses both parts of the question. However, the relevance is undermined by the incorrect assertion that the requested information (denied symptoms) does not exist in the text."
