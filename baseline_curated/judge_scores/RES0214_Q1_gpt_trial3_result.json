  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, sore throat, stuffy nose, muscle aches), consistent with the Gold Answer. However, it is factually incorrect in stating that the transcript does not contain explicit denials of cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing. The transcript clearly includes these denials: nausea/vomiting [P-5], neck stiffness [P-7], headaches [P-8], cough [P-10], and difficulty swallowing (denied; pain only) [P-24] with confirmation of ability to swallow [P-25] and no coughing after swallowing [P-26]. The Generated Answer also introduces an incorrect claim that the clinician asked about ear pain (not present in the transcript).",
    "completeness": "Reported symptoms: includes all four key symptoms, but omits some qualifying details present in the Gold Answer (e.g., sore throat \"not going away,\" muscle aches for 2–3 days and coinciding with fever, and clarification of no joint pain).\nDenied symptoms (the specifically asked set): completely misses all five explicit denials and instead claims they cannot be verified.\nOther pertinent negatives in Gold (abdominal pain, rashes/skin changes, bowel changes, etc.) are not required by the question; omission is acceptable. Overall, it captures the symptom list but fails the denial portion, which is a major part of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: (1) it asserts that the denials of cough/headache/neck stiffness/nausea/difficulty swallowing are not present, when they are explicitly present with clear patient responses; (2) it mentions an inquiry about ear pain, which is not in the provided transcript. These represent multiple unsupported/contradicted claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to answer exactly what was asked (four reported symptoms and explicit denials of specific symptoms). There is minimal extraneous content. However, the denial portion is incorrect/unsupported, which reduces utility but the content remains on-topic."
