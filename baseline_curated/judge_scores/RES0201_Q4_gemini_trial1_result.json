  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses nearly all the negative findings identified in the Gold Answer. While it identifies the denial of 'loss of smell,' it completely omits cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, and lack of sick contacts/travel. Furthermore, its logic regarding differential diagnoses relies on positive findings (difficulty breathing) rather than the 'negative findings' requested by the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. It captures only one (loss of smell) out of the approximately ten negative findings listed in the Gold Answer. It fails to provide the comprehensive list of screened and denied symptoms present in the transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a discussion regarding Strep Throat and specific logic for distinguishing Mono and Cold/Flu that is not present in the transcript. The Gold Answer correctly identifies that the transcript lacks an explicit discussion of differential diagnoses by the doctor.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address both parts of the question, it spends significant time discussing positive findings (sore throat, breathing difficulty) which the prompt specifically excluded by asking for symptoms the patient 'denied' and how 'negative findings' assist in diagnosis."
