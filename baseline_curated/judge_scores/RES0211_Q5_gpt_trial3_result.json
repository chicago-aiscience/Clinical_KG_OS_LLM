    "correctness": "- Accurately notes: father has allergies [P-33], cousin has asthma [P-30], Jessica’s allergies not active yet [P-16], and brother had a cold a few weeks ago [P-39] with doctor summarizing ~2 weeks prior [D-58].\n- Incorrectly states there is no information about living on a farm and home-schooling during COVID; the transcript explicitly includes home-schooling [P-41], parents’ work situation [P-42], living on a farm [P-43], and limited leaving the house/no travel [P-45, P-46].\n- Overstates/introduces unsupported clinical assertions: calls her illness an “upper respiratory infection” and implies this is indicated/diagnosed by [D-58]; [D-58] is only a symptom/contact summary, not a diagnosis. Also labels “fever” though she reports feeling hot without a measured temperature.\nOverall, the core exposure/family-history interpretation is partly correct, but with notable factual errors and over-interpretation.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points vs Generated Answer:\n- Family history of allergic/respiratory conditions (dad allergies, cousin asthma): Covered.\n- Allergy season not started → less likely typical allergy flare: Covered.\n- Brother’s cold a few weeks ago (~2 weeks per summary) as plausible viral exposure: Covered.\n- Farm living + home-schooling during COVID + parents working from home/on farm → relative isolation → household transmission most likely: Not covered (explicitly denied as absent).\n- No travel/doesn’t leave house: Not covered.\n- Only dog, not an animal farm → lower animal-related exposure concern: Not covered.\nNet: captures roughly half of the gold content but misses several major contextualizing points about isolation, travel, and animal exposure.",
    "faithfulness": "- Multiple ungrounded or contradictory claims:\n  - Says transcript lacks farm/schooling info, but those details are clearly present [P-41–P-45].\n  - Introduces a diagnosis (“upper respiratory infection”) not stated in the transcript.\n  - Describes “fever” as a fact rather than the patient’s subjective feeling hot.\nThese issues represent more than minor unverifiable details; they materially conflict with the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "- Generally addresses how family history, brother’s illness, and living situation relate to current symptoms.\n- However, it fails the question’s intent by incorrectly claiming the farm/home-schooling factors can’t be assessed, despite being central to the question and present in the transcript.\n- Still largely focused on the asked factors (no major unrelated tangents)."
