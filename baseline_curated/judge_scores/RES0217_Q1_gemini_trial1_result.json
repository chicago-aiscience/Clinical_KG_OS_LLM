  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. Most significantly, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain an explicit denial of fever; however, in [D-8] the doctor asks about fever and the patient denies it in [P-8] ('No, no, I've been fine'). It also incorrectly cites [P-6] as the denial for headaches, when [P-6] is actually the patient's discussion about the bullseye rash (headaches are denied in [P-19]).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover approximately half of the key points in the Gold Answer. It misses the patient's description of the tick being 'stuck pretty good' [P-1] and the critical pertinent negative regarding the absence of a 'target' or 'bullseye' rash [P-6]. It also fails to report the fever denial specifically requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source text by claiming that a fever denial is absent when it is clearly present in [P-8]. It also hallucinates that the headache denial occurs in [P-6], which is a segment of the transcript focused on skin appearance and the absence of a rash.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in its structure, directly addressing both the local symptoms and the systemic screening list provided in the question, although the content within those sections is flawed."
