  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer regarding the diagnostic tests (tick ID, blood work, physical exam) and the use of prophylactic antibiotics. However, it incorrectly includes the patient's existing cholesterol medication (statin) as part of the doctor's 'comprehensive clinical plan' for the tick bite, whereas the transcript shows this was gathered as medical history and not a new recommendation or part of the acute plan.",
    "completeness": "The response covers approximately 80% of the key points. It identifies the three diagnostic tests and the antibiotic treatment. However, it misses the specific geographic risk factor mentioned in the Gold Answer (Strathroy) and the descriptive advice regarding the ticks' 'waving motion' with their legs.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in the transcript. The mention of the statin is accurate to the patient's history in the text, though its inclusion as a 'proposed treatment' in the clinical plan is a minor contextual misinterpretation. No information is hallucinated.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to address each specific component of the multi-part question, including diagnostics, treatments, consultations, and preventive advice."
