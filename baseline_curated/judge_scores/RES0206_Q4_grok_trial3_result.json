{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the COVID swab as the test ordered, and correctly paraphrases the key details from P-20 about meeting friends for dog walks, one being sick, walking too close despite being outdoors, and feeling too safe—all matching the Gold Answer and transcript with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 to rule out [D-43]; (2) COVID swab test [D-43]; (3) social contacts details from P-20 (friends, dog walks, sick friend, too close, false safety); covered fully. Additional Gold points: doctor's question on friend's COVID test [D-21/P-21]; screening for smell/taste/confusion/aches/travel; rationale for testing despite no symptoms—missed, covering core ~80-90% focused on question's three elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: COVID-19 and swab from [D-43]; social contact details directly from [P-20] with accurate paraphrase of quotes ('too safe', 'a little too close'); citations correct; no hallucinations or unverifiable content.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely answers the three-part question (condition, test, prompting social contact detail) with no off-topic content or tangents."
