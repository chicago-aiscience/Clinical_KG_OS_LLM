  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition to rule out (COVID-19), the test (swab), the turnaround time (24 to 48 hours), and the alternative diagnosis (viral illness). These facts are perfectly aligned with both the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer addresses all parts of the specific question. However, compared to the Gold Answer, it omits details about the 14-day isolation instruction and the mention of contact tracing by public health if the test is positive. It covers approximately 80% of the narrative points provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript. It mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context, but the clinical facts it attributes to this graph (symptoms like cough and loss of smell) are indeed present in the transcript. All specific details regarding the doctor's plan are accurately reflected from section [D-52].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the multi-part question precisely. It provides the requested information without excessive irrelevant detail, though it does include some extra symptom context."
