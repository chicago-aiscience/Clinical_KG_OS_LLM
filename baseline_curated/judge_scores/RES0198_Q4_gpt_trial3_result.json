  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the COVID swab test, the 48-hour turnaround, and the instruction to isolate at home and avoid seeing others. It does not introduce any contradictory or incorrect facts compared with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points: (1) COVID-19 to rule out, (2) COVID swab ordered today, (3) results in 48 hours, (4) isolate at home/avoid others. It misses one key instruction included in the Gold Answer: that once results return, the patient would receive further instructions from public health.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript (primarily [D-39] and [P-1]) and do not add unsupported details. No hallucinations noted.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all components of the question (condition, test, turnaround time, and instructions) with no irrelevant tangents."
