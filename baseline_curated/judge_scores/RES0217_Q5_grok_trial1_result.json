  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the attachment duration reasoning, matching the Gold Answer's coverage of Friday hiking, Saturday gardening [P-1], discovery 'earlier today' [D-1], and doctor's estimation of >72 hours [D-6] leading to prophylaxis. However, it incorrectly states that Strathroy's position on the Lyme map is 'not present' in the transcript, contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [D-13], where the doctor explicitly references the map and deems Strathroy 'a little bit of a concerning point.' It also misattributes justification to prior rash [P-3] instead of geographic risk. This introduces significant factual errors on the second half of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: hiking/gardening activities [P-1], >72h duration [D-6], prophylactic need [D-6]. Missed entirely: Strathroy location [P-12], doctor's map reference and assessment as concerning [D-13], combination justifying antibiotics [D-13]. Covers approximately 50% of Gold Answer key points (duration part but not geographic).",
    "faithfulness": "Duration claims verifiable [P-1, D-6, D-2]. Geographic claim 'not present' is false [D-13]; adds unverified 'typical window for bacterial transmission' (plausible but not explicit); misstates reliance on prior rash [P-3, D-6] over map/location. Multiple inaccuracies and denial of transcript content indicate hallucination/misreading.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses attachment duration perfectly; addresses map usage by denying it (though incorrectly), staying on-topic without tangents. Mostly relevant to both question parts."
