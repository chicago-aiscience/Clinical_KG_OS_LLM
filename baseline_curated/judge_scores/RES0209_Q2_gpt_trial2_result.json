  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient uses a bronchodilator “puffer” (inhaler) and implies it is used for symptom relief. However, it contains major inaccuracies relative to the Gold Answer and transcript: (1) it incorrectly states the transcript does not contain a dialogue where the doctor asks about a daily controller medication—this is explicitly asked in D-5 (“one that you take every day no matter what?”) with the patient denying it in P-5; (2) it misuses P-12 (“never been formally diagnosed”) which refers to allergies, not asthma (the patient states they were diagnosed with asthma at age 8); (3) it introduces “inhaled corticosteroid” as the daily controller type, which is not specified in the transcript or Gold Answer (the doctor only asks generally about a daily medication). These errors affect a key part of the question (what the doctor asked about).",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are covered: bronchodilator is the only asthma medication; administered via a puffer/inhaler; patient lacks a daily controller medication. Missing or inadequately captured: explicit as-needed basis (D-4/P-4 and D-6); explicit denial of other medications (D-6/P-6; D-30/P-30) is not clearly stated; the clinician’s specific question about “every day no matter what” medication (D-5) is incorrectly denied as present; additional context in Gold about increased use and clinical significance is not included (less critical, but still part of Gold’s content).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: reference to a “Knowledge Graph” categorization is fabricated; the claim that the doctor did not ask about a daily controller contradicts the transcript (D-5); linking lack of “formal diagnosis” to asthma is unsupported and contradicts P-2 (asthma diagnosis at age 8). The only clearly grounded parts are that the patient uses a bronchodilator and that it is a puffer/inhaler (P-7/D-7).",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally aimed at the question (current asthma medication, how administered, and the absent daily controller). However, it includes irrelevant/unsupported rationale (formal diagnosis claim, Knowledge Graph mention) and mischaracterizes whether the clinician asked about a daily medication, which is central to the question."
