  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly reports several symptoms from the transcript: generalized weakness/run-down feeling (P-1, P-2), decreased appetite/poor intake (P-2), and generalized body aches (P-20). It also correctly notes mild headaches not worse than usual (P-11). However, it contains a substantive inaccuracy by describing a “dry throat sensation” based on P-8; that line refers to a dry cough feeling like it’s starting, not throat dryness. It also frames headaches under “Sensory Changes,” which is a categorization error (not a factual one), but it further fails to mention the actual sensory changes (taste/smell loss). Overall, some correct elements with at least one clear symptom misstatement.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: weakness/run-down, decreased appetite/reduced eating, generalized myalgias/achiness, mild usual headaches, and (partially) minimal cough.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: loss of taste (P-4), diminished smell (P-6), subjective fever/warmth (P-4), sore throat (P-9), characterization of cough as starting/“on its way” (P-7, P-8) (the answer only notes not coughing much), explicit denial of runny nose/congestion (P-10). Because multiple major symptom domains (sensory changes and fever, plus sore throat and congestion denial) are omitted, coverage is well below ~80% and closer to ~20–49%.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations (weakness, appetite, aches, headaches). The main faithfulness issue is the “dry throat sensation” claim attributed to P-8, which is not what the patient said (it was a dry cough sensation). This constitutes an ungrounded/misattributed detail, though there are not numerous fabricated symptoms beyond that.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on additional symptoms beyond shortness of breath and fatigue and attempts to organize them by the requested domains (sensory/URI/musculoskeletal/constitutional). There is minimal off-topic content. However, it does not actually provide the key sensory changes asked for, which reduces how well it addresses the prompt despite being on-topic."
