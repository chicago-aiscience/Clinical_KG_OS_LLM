  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the brother's illness and family history of allergies and asthma. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating that the transcript does not contain information about Jessica living on a farm or homeschooling during COVID. These details are explicitly mentioned in turns [P-41], [P-42], and [P-43].",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete as it fails to address the 'household living situation on a farm with home-schooling' portion of the prompt, which the Gold Answer correctly links to the 'isolated environment' and 'intra-household transmission' theory.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a 'negative hallucination' by claiming the source text does not contain specific information that is clearly present in multiple turns of the transcript. While the points it does cover are grounded, the dismissal of existing evidence is a failure of faithfulness to the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it addresses the medical history and brother's illness, it explicitly refuses to address the environmental and social factors requested in the prompt, claiming they are missing from the source."
