  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely consistent with the clinical facts presented in the transcript. However, it references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context, potentially leading to extra-textual interpretations. The clinical logic regarding fever and sputum is sound but the source attribution is flawed.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the main symptoms (fever, sputum, dyspnea, sick contact) but misses several specific details found in the Gold Answer: sinus pressure [P-12], mild headache [P-14], and decreased exercise tolerance specifically related to walking the dog [P-4]. It also omits the exclusion of alternative triggers like environmental exposures [P-38] and medication non-adherence [P-26] which were key parts of the Gold Answer's reasoning.",
    "faithfulness": "The response hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' and uses it to justify clinical claims. While the claims themselves are medically plausible, they are not strictly grounded in the provided transcript or prompt materials.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question, organizing the response by diagnosis and specific findings."
