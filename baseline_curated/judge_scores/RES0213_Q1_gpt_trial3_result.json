  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the pain as “very sharp, strong” and pleuritic (with deep inspiration) and gives the episode duration (~20 minutes) and common contexts (walking alone, studying). However, it overstates/rewrites causality by saying the pain is “linked to stress and anxiety” (the patient only speculates it “could be stress” and describes noticing it more when alone/preoccupied), and it contains a clear inaccuracy: it implies the chest pain does not occur except during an anxiety attack, citing [P-20], but [P-20] is about palpitations/heart flutter during anxiety attacks—not chest pain occurrence. These errors lower factual accuracy despite the core description being mostly correct.",
    "completeness": "Key gold points included: sharp/strong with deep breath; ~20-minute episodes; occurs while walking alone/studying; tends to go away/not be noticed when talking to people/doing tasks. Missing or not stated: initial description as “very uncomfortable/odd” (not exactly pain); overall symptom duration (~1.5 weeks); intermittent recurrence “here and there”/several times per day; can occur at rest (explicitly confirmed); not worse with exercise; no injury/accident; no prior similar pain. Overall coverage is partial (~50–70%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (sharp with deep breath; 20-minute episodes; noticed when alone; less noticed with others/hands-on tasks). But the claim about non-occurrence outside anxiety attacks is not supported by the cited line and misattributes palpitations content to chest pain. The “linked to stress and anxiety” phrasing is stronger than the transcript supports (speculation rather than confirmed trigger).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested characteristics (quality, duration, and when it occurs vs resolves) with minimal extraneous information."
