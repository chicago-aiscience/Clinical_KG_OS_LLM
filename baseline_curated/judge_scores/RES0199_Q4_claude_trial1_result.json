  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, the swab as the diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. It accurately states the alternative diagnosis as 'another viral illness.' All core facts align with the Gold Answer, though it adds some extra context from the knowledge graph about symptoms and supportive management.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all four key components requested: (1) condition to rule out (COVID-19), (2) diagnostic test (swab), (3) turnaround time (24-48 hours), and (4) alternative diagnosis (viral illness). It includes the essential information from the Gold Answer but omits some contextual details like the 14-day isolation instruction and contact tracing mention. Covers approximately 85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript, with accurate citation [D-52] for all major claims. The reference to symptoms (headache, dry cough, loss of smell) is verifiable in earlier parts of the transcript [P-5, P-12, P-24]. The mention of 'knowledge graph' suggests additional context not in the transcript, but the core clinical information is faithfully represented without fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses all parts of the multi-part question: what condition to rule out, what test was ordered, the turnaround time, and the alternative diagnosis. The additional context about symptoms and supportive management is relevant but not strictly necessary for the question asked. Overall highly focused and relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-structured response that correctly identifies all key elements: COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, swab test ordered, 24-48 hour turnaround, and viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. Citations are accurate and claims are verifiable in the transcript. Minor deductions for omitting contextual details (isolation instruction, contact tracing) and introducing knowledge graph references not in the source material, though these don't compromise factual accuracy. The answer is highly relevant and addresses all components of the question comprehensively."
