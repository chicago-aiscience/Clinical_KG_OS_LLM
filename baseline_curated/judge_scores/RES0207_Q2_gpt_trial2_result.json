  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s medication for epilepsy (matches Gold Answer). However, it does not provide the specific circumstance that led to the missed dose (daughter’s birthday celebration, altered routine/no usual dinner), instead giving only a generic cause (“forgot”). Since the question explicitly asks for the specific circumstance, the answer is only partially correct.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) Keppra for epilepsy; (2) that a dose was missed due to forgetting. Misses: the key detail that the missed dose occurred because it was the daughter’s birthday, they celebrated earlier, and the patient typically takes Keppra with dinner but didn’t have the usual dinner routine/time and therefore forgot. Also misses the clarification that this was situational rather than an ongoing adherence issue.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements that the patient takes Keppra and forgot a dose are grounded in the transcript. However, references to a “knowledge graph link” and what it “supports” are not present in the transcript and are therefore unverifiable additions (minor hallucinated framing).",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the two items asked (medication and reason for missed dose), though it provides an incomplete version of the second item."
