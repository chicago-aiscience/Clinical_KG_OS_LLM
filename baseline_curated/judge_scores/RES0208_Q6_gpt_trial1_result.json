  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the plan stated in the transcript and Gold Answer: chest-focused physical exam, chest X-ray, COVID swab, self-isolation away from everyone including wife if discharged, results in 24–48 hours, and disposition (admit vs discharge) based on results. No substantive factual contradictions are present. Minor issue: it omits the public health nurse follow-up if positive (more a completeness gap than an accuracy error).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) planned chest/physical exam, (2) tests ordered—CXR and COVID swab, (3) self-isolation instruction including staying away from wife, (4) results timeline 24–48h, (5) disposition contingent on results and no specific numeric thresholds. Key element missed: the Gold Answer’s statement that a public health nurse would contact the patient and advise next steps if the COVID result is positive.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by the transcript (especially D-37/D-38). However, the opening phrase referencing a “knowledge graph” is not in the transcript, and “start this immediately” is implied rather than explicitly stated. These are minor/unverifiable additions; otherwise the content is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the management plan elements asked (tests, exam, isolation instructions, timeline, and admit/discharge criteria). The brief ‘clinical impression’ section is slightly extra but still relevant context and does not distract."
