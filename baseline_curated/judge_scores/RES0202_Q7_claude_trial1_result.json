  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer. Both correctly identify: (1) Wednesday evening as cough onset, (2) Thursday as continuation with worsening and fatigue, (3) Friday as fever emergence (100.1-101°F), worsening cough, decreased appetite, possible taste loss, and fatigue. The Generated Answer accurately captures the stepwise progression and specific temperatures mentioned.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but omits some details present in the Gold Answer: (1) the runny nose mentioned on Friday [P-16], (2) the explicit clarification that the child appeared 'fine' initially on Wednesday before symptoms began, (3) the mother's summary statement about stepwise worsening [P-12], and (4) the correction of timeline from 5 days to 3 days [P-4]. However, it covers all critical symptom developments including cough onset, progression, fever emergence, fatigue, and appetite/taste changes.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The timeline (Wednesday night cough, Thursday worsening with fatigue, Friday fever and additional symptoms) is properly grounded. Temperature readings (101°F or 100.1°F), symptom descriptions (dry cough, tired, decreased appetite, loss of taste), and the day-by-day progression all match transcript statements with appropriate citation numbers.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's specific requirements: when cough appeared (Wednesday night), how it changed in severity (worsened Thursday, continued worsening Friday), when fever emerged (Friday), and when other symptoms appeared (fatigue Thursday, decreased appetite and taste loss Friday). The response is well-focused and organized chronologically as requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-grounded day-by-day account of the child's illness progression. It correctly identifies all major symptom developments with proper citations and directly addresses the question's requirements. The only minor weakness is the omission of some details present in the Gold Answer (runny nose, timeline correction, mother's summary statement), which prevents a perfect completeness score."
