  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnostic test (COVID swab) and the primary rationale (household transmission via the husband's symptoms), which aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points: the test and the husband's role in the prioritization. It misses the Gold Answer's secondary points regarding the urgency of containment (self-isolation) and the fact that influenza was only discussed after the COVID workup was prioritized and the flu shot status was determined. However, it captures the core reasoning well.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using direct quotes and accurate citations ([D-53], [P-1], [P-19]). No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the two parts of the question: the test ordered and the rationale for its prioritization."
