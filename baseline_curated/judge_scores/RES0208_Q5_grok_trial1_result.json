  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately details the grandson exposure [P-23], timing [P-1], doctor's acknowledgment [D-24], and explicit exploration/exclusion of travel [D-24/P-24] and recent client visits [P-31/D-32/P-32], linking to infection assessment [D-36]. Generated Answer correctly identifies grandson exposure [P-23] and ties it to infection [D-36], but falsely claims no evidence in transcript for travel or client visits exploration (directly contradicting transcript and Gold), and hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph'. Significant factual errors and contradictions warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: grandson visit/daycare/cold details [P-23]; symptom onset timing post-visit [P-1]; doctor acknowledgment [D-24]; travel excluded [D-24/P-24]; work/client visits explored and excluded as recent [P-31/D-32/P-32]; supports infection dx [D-36]. Generated covers grandson exposure and general infection link (~30-40%), but misses timing, travel exclusion, client exclusion entirely. Covers 20-49% of key points, score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about grandson [P-23] and infection [D-36] verifiable. However, asserts 'transcript segments do not contain evidence' for travel/client exploration (falsely; see D-24, P-31, D-32/P-32); hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' not in transcript. Multiple inaccuracies and fabrications, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses grandson connection to infection assessment and other pathways (though incorrectly claiming them unaddressed). No major off-topic content, mostly focused on question's two parts, minor tangents like COVID details. Score 4."
