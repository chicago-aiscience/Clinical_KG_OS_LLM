  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies that the doctor screened for palpitations/arrhythmias by asking about heart flutter/skipping beats (D-20) and asking about “arrhythmias” (D-32), and that the patient largely denied these symptoms except in the context of anxiety (P-20). However, it contains a clear factual error: it states the patient’s response to the asthma screening was “not included,” but the transcript explicitly includes denials of childhood asthma (P-23) and current asthma (P-24).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer lists 6 ruled-out/screened conditions with the specific questions used: (1) trauma/MSK injury, (2) cardiac disease/exertional angina features, (3) infectious/febrile illness and sick contacts, (4) asthma, (5) dyspnea/shortness of breath, (6) inherited arrhythmia/sudden death history. The Generated Answer covers only a portion of (6) (palpitations/arrhythmias) and omits (1)-(5) entirely; it also incorrectly claims asthma cannot be assessed from the transcript. Overall coverage is far below 50%.",
    "faithfulness": "Most quoted/attributed content about fluttering/skipping beats (D-20) and denial (P-20) is grounded in the transcript. However, the statement that the asthma response was not included is contradicted by the transcript (P-23, P-24), making the response partially unfaithful to the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on the topic of conditions the clinician screened for and the questions used to rule them out. It is highly relevant to the question, though it is very incomplete."

  "summary": "The answer is on-topic and accurately captures arrhythmia/palpitations screening, but it misses most of the ruled-out conditions from the consultation and includes an incorrect claim about absent asthma responses."
