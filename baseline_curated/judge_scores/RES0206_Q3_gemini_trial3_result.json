  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript regarding the symptoms of fever, cough, sputum, and dyspnea. It correctly aligns these with the doctor's assessment of a dual diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: sinus pressure [P-12], mild headache [P-14], and decreased exercise tolerance (difficulty walking the dog) [P-4]. It also omits the doctor's clinical reasoning regarding the exclusion of environmental triggers [P-38] and medication non-adherence [P-26], as well as the patient's own observation about past sickness triggers [P-3].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer mostly reflects the transcript but hallucinates the presence of a 'knowledge graph' to explain clinical meanings (e.g., green sputum signifying obstruction) which is not present in the provided context. The inference about the infection 'moving into the airways' is a clinical extrapolation rather than a direct statement from the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on the dual assessment and the distinguishing roles of fever and sputum as requested by the prompt."
