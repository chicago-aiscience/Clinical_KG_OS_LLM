  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety-related/stress-induced chest pain as the diagnosis, which aligns with the Gold Answer. The key facts about situational triggers, distraction relief, anxiety history, and current stressors are accurately represented. However, the Generated Answer uses the term 'Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain' while the Gold Answer uses 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain,' which are essentially equivalent. The Generated Answer also correctly references the patient's statements about the pain occurring when alone and resolving with distraction.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer including: situational pattern (alone vs. distracted), history of anxiety attacks, current academic stress, breathing pattern changes during episodes, and the patient's own consideration of stress as a cause. However, it omits several important supporting details present in the Gold Answer: (1) pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, pain at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety episodes, no asthma), (2) specific timeline details (8 years untreated, Masters thesis deadline), (3) the detail about making herself nervous, and (4) the explicit ruling out of cardiac/pulmonary pathology. These omissions represent approximately 30-35% of the Gold Answer's supporting evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The situational triggers [P-29], distraction response [P-29], physiological anxiety signs [P-19], history of anxiety [P-20], current stressors [P-13], and patient's belief about stress [P-8] are all correctly cited. There are no hallucinated facts or fabricated content. The interpretation of 'psychosomatic response' is a reasonable clinical inference from the presented data, though not explicitly stated in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about diagnosis and supporting clinical observations. It stays focused on the relevant information linking the patient's symptoms to anxiety/stress. The structure clearly presents the diagnosis followed by supporting evidence from the consultation. There is minimal irrelevant content, though the brief explanation of 'psychosomatic response' and 'underlying mechanism' could be considered slightly tangential to the specific question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety-related chest pain as the diagnosis and provides accurate, relevant supporting evidence from the consultation. The response demonstrates strong correctness and faithfulness with all claims verifiable in the transcript. However, it lacks completeness by omitting important pertinent negatives and specific details about the patient's timeline and explicit ruling out of cardiac/pulmonary causes that strengthen the diagnosis. Despite this gap in comprehensiveness, the answer remains highly relevant and factually accurate for the core diagnostic reasoning requested."
