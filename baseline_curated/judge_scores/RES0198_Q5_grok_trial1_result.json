  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the nephew in daycare as the exposure source [P-11], matching the Gold Answer, and links it to viral symptoms consistent with the doctor's assessment [D-39]. It accurately notes type 1 diabetes [P-23] and insulin management [D-25]. However, it introduces a 'Knowledge Graph' not present in the Gold Answer or transcript, and frames the diabetes relation around management/adherence rather than noting the lack of explicit immune function linkage or full PMH details in the Gold Answer, representing minor discrepancies while keeping core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: nephew daycare exposure [P-11]; viral symptoms [P-1, D-39]; type 1 diabetes [P-23]; insulin management [D-25]. Missed: nephew reported not sick but still plausible source [P-12]; diabetes diagnosed at age 7, endocrinologist [P-24, P-26]; no explicit doctor discussion of immune implications; additional negatives like no other meds [P-27], no allergies [P-28], no hospitalizations [P-29]; symptom persistence detail [P-1, P-2]. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like nephew daycare [P-11], symptoms [P-1], viral diagnosis [D-39], diabetes [P-23], and insulin questions [D-25] are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The 'Knowledge Graph' reference is not in the transcript and appears hallucinated, though the general idea of daycare as a viral source is plausible. Diabetes-immune prompt reference is from the question but not elaborated as in Gold. Overall, some unverifiable claims but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly identifies the exposure source and links it causally to the viral presentation, addresses diabetes in context of the question by noting management during acute illness and immune function per prompt, with minimal tangents like Knowledge Graph still tied to causation."
