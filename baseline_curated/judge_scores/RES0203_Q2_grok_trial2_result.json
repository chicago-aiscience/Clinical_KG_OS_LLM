  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states patient tried no treatments or OTC meds [D-9, P-9] and no regular meds [D-24, P-24]. Generated correctly notes no explicit treatments for symptoms but inaccurately frames past alcohol [P-33] and edibles [P-34] as relevant 'self-treatments/history,' which they are not (not for current symptoms). Doctor's recommendation matches (COVID swab test [D-39], isolation instructions), but omits no medication prescribed, results timeline ('day or two'), and potential other tests/consult [D-40]. Core facts correct with minor irrelevant addition and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: no prior treatments (partially, misses explicit citations and no regular meds detail), COVID swab test, self-isolation instructions (including continuation if negative but symptomatic). Missed: explicit 'no OTC tried' context, no regular medications, no medication prescribed statement, results take 'day or two,' potential other tests and supervising doctor consult. Covers ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: no treatments [P-9], alcohol/edibles [P-33/34] (though miscontextualized as treatments), swab test and isolation [D-39]. Citations accurate. Minor issue: alcohol/edibles not treatments for symptoms (plausible past history but hallucinated relevance), no outright fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses patient's prior treatments (none) and doctor's recommendation (test + instructions). Minor tangent: irrelevant past alcohol/edibles under self-treatments section, but structure otherwise focused on question."
