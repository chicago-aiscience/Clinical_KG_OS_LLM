  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's stated plan from [D-37], including the exact physical exam components (quick listen to heart and lungs, quick physical exam) and the consultative process (consult with supervising doctor, review discussion, return to discuss next steps), with direct quotes matching the transcript and Gold Answer; no factual errors or contradictions, though it omits contextual details like foreshadowing in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], and trainee context.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam components (listen to heart/lungs, quick physical exam), consultative process (consult supervising physician, review everything, return to discuss next steps), and citation [D-37] (100% of core plan); missed: multi-step plan framing, foreshadowing [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], no diagnosis/meds/trainee note (covers ~85% of Gold's points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-37] with accurate quotes and citation; no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications—fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by focusing exclusively on the doctor's end-of-consultation plan, specified physical exam components, and next-steps process, structured in clear bullets with no off-topic content."
