  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error regarding the sensory symptoms; it claims a 'total loss of smell,' whereas the transcript [P-19] explicitly states 'not smell' in response to a question about loss of smell. It also fails to mention the worsening of the breathing difficulty or the specific difficulty swallowing food mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to include specific chronological markers provided in the transcript and Gold Answer, such as 'yesterday' for breathing difficulty [P-8], 'two days ago' for taste [P-20], and 'immediately after' for muscle aches [P-26]. It also misses the detail about the sore throat interfering with swallowing food but not fluids.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates that the timing for systemic symptoms was not quantified, despite the patient stating they started 'immediately after' the sore throat [P-26]. It also hallucinates a 'total loss of smell,' which contradicts the patient's statement in [P-19].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is relevant in structure as it attempts to answer the prompt's request for chronological order and severity changes, although it fails to deliver accurate or complete information for those categories."
