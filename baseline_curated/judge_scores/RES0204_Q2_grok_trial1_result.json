  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the doctor proposed a COVID swab [D-39] and provides the exact rationale from the transcript ('doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately' [D-39]), which matches the Gold Answer. However, it omits the chest X-ray proposed in [D-37], which the Gold Answer lists as the first procedure. While there are no contradictions or invented facts, the omission of one proposed procedure creates a discrepancy in fully representing the facts as per the Gold Answer. Some factual errors (omission) but main point on COVID correct. Score: 3",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: confirmation of no medications (given in question), proposal of chest X-ray with explanation and citations [D-37, D-39], proposal of COVID swab [D-39], specific rationale as institutional protocol [D-39], details on discomfort and reassurance [D-39], plan to arrange and discuss [D-40]. Generated covers only the COVID swab proposal and rationale (~25-30% coverage: 2 out of 6+ key points). Misses chest X-ray entirely and other details. Covers 20-49%. Score: 2",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (proposal of COVID swab and exact rationale quote) are directly verifiable in transcript [D-39] with accurate citations. No hallucinated facts, unverifiable details, or fabrications. Fully grounded. Score: 5",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the rationale for the COVID swab perfectly and mentions one proposed procedure. However, incompletely addresses 'diagnostic procedures' (plural) by omitting chest X-ray. No irrelevant or off-topic content, mostly focused on the question. Score: 4"
