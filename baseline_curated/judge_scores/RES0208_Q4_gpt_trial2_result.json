    "correctness": "The Gold Answer lists multiple ROS “pertinent negatives” explicitly asked and denied (runny nose/congestion; vision/hearing changes; nausea/vomiting; chest pain; palpitations; abdominal pain; urinary symptoms; numbness/tingling) and explains how these support a working diagnosis of respiratory infection/possible COVID while arguing against cardiac, GI, neurologic, and typical cold etiologies. \n\nThe Generated Answer is factually inconsistent with this:\n- It incorrectly highlights sore throat and cough as the main “negated” ROS items; sore throat was actually endorsed (P-9), and cough was not clearly denied (patient said maybe starting, hasn’t been coughing much).\n- It fails to correctly enumerate the explicit denied symptoms from the transcript (misses vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling).\n- It introduces an unsupported claim that anosmia was absent; in the transcript, the patient endorses reduced smell (“yeah, kind of,” P-6).\n- It adds speculative/unsupported reasoning (e.g., “knowledge graph,” pneumonia vs COVID framing, pleuritic chest pain typicality) that is not in the Gold Answer and not clearly grounded in the transcript.\nOverall, the main clinical conclusion (infection/COVID consideration) is partially aligned, but the symptom-negation portion is largely wrong.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that should be covered:\n- Explicitly asked-and-denied symptoms: runny nose/congestion; vision/hearing changes; nausea/vomiting; chest pain; palpitations; abdominal pain; urinary symptoms; numbness/tingling.\n- Explanation of how these negatives differentiate: chest pain/palpitations argue against cardiac causes; GI negatives argue against GI causes; absence of runny nose/congestion argues against typical cold/URI; neuro negatives argue against neurologic causes; overall supports respiratory infection/possible COVID.\n\nCoverage in the Generated Answer:\n- Mentions absence of runny nose (in differentiation section) and absence of chest pain (in differentiation section), but does not systematically list them as the explicitly negated ROS items.\n- Omits palpitations, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, vision/hearing changes, numbness/tingling.\n- Does not provide the same structured differential value of each negative as in the Gold Answer.\nThis is well below full coverage (only a small subset of the required symptoms and rationale).",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript:\n- “Knowledge graph” references are not in the transcript.\n- Claims anosmia was absent; transcript suggests decreased smell (P-6).\n- Pneumonia vs COVID differentiation using pleuritic chest pain is speculative and not stated by the clinician in the transcript.\n- The answer implies the doctor performed a “systemic review” captured in D-36 beyond what was asked; D-36 is a summary but does not support several added assertions.\nSome elements (infection/COVID not ruled out; chest X-ray; runny nose denial) are grounded, but there are enough ungrounded/incorrect additions to lower faithfulness substantially.",
    "relevance": "The response partially addresses the second part (how negatives help differentiate causes of dyspnea), but it does not directly answer the core first part: listing the specific symptoms explicitly asked about and negated during ROS. It also introduces tangential or speculative content (knowledge graph, pneumonia framing) and focuses on sore throat/cough rather than the requested denied symptoms. Overall, it is only partially aligned with the question."
