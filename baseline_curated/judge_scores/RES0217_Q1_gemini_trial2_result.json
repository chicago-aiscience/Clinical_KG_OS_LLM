  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It incorrectly states that the patient did not explicitly deny fever, whereas P-8 clearly shows the patient denying it ('No, no, I've been fine' in response to a question about fever). It also incorrectly cites [P-6] for the headache denial; [P-6] refers to the bullseye rash, while the headache denial occurs in [P-19/20]. Additionally, it misses the pertinent negative regarding the bullseye/target rash as a local finding.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses key details from the Gold Answer, such as the patient's denial of a 'target rash' and the description that the tick was 'stuck pretty good.' Crucially, it fails to report the patient's denial of fever, which was specifically requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the transcript by claiming that an explicit denial of fever is absent when it is present in [P-8]. It also attributes the headache denial to the wrong turn in the conversation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in its structure, directly attempting to answer both components of the prompt (local and systemic symptoms). However, the accuracy of the content provided within that structure is flawed."
