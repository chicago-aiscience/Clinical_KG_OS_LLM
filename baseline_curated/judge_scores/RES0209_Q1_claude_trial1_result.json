  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the dry cough, breathing difficulties, and wheezing. It accurately captures the daytime vs nighttime frequency differences. However, it omits chest tightness, which was mentioned in the Gold Answer (D-20, P-20). The duration of symptoms (two weeks) is also not mentioned, though this is a minor omission.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 75-80% of key points from the Gold Answer. It captures: (1) dry cough character, (2) breathing difficulties/shortness of breath, (3) wheezing, and (4) daytime vs nighttime frequency differences with specific quotes. However, it misses: (1) chest tightness as a fourth symptom, (2) the two-week duration of symptoms, (3) the detail about wheezing occurring more frequently than bronchodilator use, and (4) the specific context that breathing becomes hard when wheezing gets severe.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. All claims are directly verifiable: dry cough [P-1], shortness of breath [P-1], wheezing [P-15], and nighttime frequency [P-18]. The citations are accurate and the information is not fabricated. However, it fails to mention chest tightness which is clearly present in the transcript at [D-20, P-20].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all aspects of the question: specific symptoms (cough character, breathing difficulties, wheezing), and daytime vs nighttime frequency differences. The response is well-organized and focused on the question without irrelevant content. The only issue is incompleteness rather than irrelevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and highly relevant response that is well-grounded in the transcript. It correctly identifies and describes the dry cough, breathing difficulties, and wheezing, with accurate frequency differences between daytime and nighttime symptoms. The answer loses points primarily for completeness - notably missing chest tightness as a fourth symptom and the two-week duration. All included information is factually correct and properly cited, demonstrating excellent faithfulness to the source material. The response directly addresses the question without tangential content."
