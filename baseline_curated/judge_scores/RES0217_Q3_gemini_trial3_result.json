  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the tick attachment duration, exposure activities, and prior history. However, it incorrectly attributes the 'Geographic Risk Assessment' to the doctor's description of the deer tick species in [D-5], whereas the actual geographic assessment involves the mention of Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map found in [D-12] and [D-13].",
    "completeness": "The answer addresses all four categories requested in the prompt. However, it misses the specific geographic details (Strathroy, the Ontario map) that are central to the 'Geographic Risk Assessment' mentioned in the Gold Answer. It also misses the patient's specific reasoning about all ticks in the area being potential carriers.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is grounded in the transcript, although the categorization of 'Geographic Risk' relies on an excerpt [D-5] that is actually about physical identification rather than geography.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses each component of the multi-part question provided."
