  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer regarding the symptoms (dry cough, fever, scratchy throat, headache) and the significance of the absence of sputum, GI symptoms, and joint pain. It correctly identifies how these findings support a URI diagnosis over lower respiratory or systemic infections.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two key points present in the Gold Answer: the patient's report of malaise/fatigue and the epidemiological link provided by her brother's recent cold (household exposure). While it covers the symptoms and the negative findings well, these omissions reduce the overall strength of the 'support' for the assessment compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer refers to a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source for diagnostic indicators, which is not present in the provided transcript or prompt context. However, the specific clinical details it attributes to the transcript (P-1, P-7, D-58, etc.) are accurately cited and grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both the positive and negative symptoms mentioned in the question and explaining their clinical significance in the context of a URI assessment."
