  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The overall phase structure (onset over last couple of days → subjective fever yesterday → taste loss this morning → cough/sore throat just starting) matches the Gold Answer, but there are several factual inaccuracies:\n- Sore throat is incorrectly cited to [P-6]; [P-6] is about diminished smell, not sore throat. Sore throat is discussed at [P-9].\n- Cough is mischaracterized: the patient *does* explicitly mention he might be “starting one” and that it feels dry and “on its way” [P-7, P-8]. The generated answer states the patient does not explicitly vocalize a cough.\n- Muscle aches are presented as only a doctor-noted finding; however the patient explicitly reports feeling “overall achy” [P-20, P-21].\n- “Difficulty breathing … highlighted as a critical, worsening issue” is not clearly supported; the transcript supports presence and clinical concern, but not clear worsening over time.\nThese errors make the answer partially inaccurate despite getting the broad timeline mostly right.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: onset shortness of breath and fatigue/malaise; subjective fever yesterday; loss of taste this morning; cough and sore throat as emerging.\nMissing or inadequately covered vs Gold Answer:\n- Reduced appetite from onset (“haven’t really been eating a lot / not hungry”) [P-2, P-4].\n- Weakness explicitly (mentioned briefly but not tied to timeline as in Gold).\n- Loss/diminution of smell the morning of consultation [P-6].\n- Headaches (mild, baseline) [P-11, P-12].\n- Body aches included but incorrectly framed as doctor-noted and not as patient-reported; also Gold notes onset not specified.\nOverall, it captures some core points but misses several important symptoms and nuances from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded or are mis-grounded in the transcript:\n- Incorrect citation/claim that sore throat is confirmed at [P-6].\n- Claim that cough is identified by the doctor but not vocalized by the patient contradicts [P-7, P-8].\n- Muscle aches attributed to doctor’s summary rather than patient’s report, despite [P-20, P-21].\n- Reference to a “provided knowledge graph” is not present in the source.\nMuch of the remainder is transcript-consistent, but these issues reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on reconstructing symptom chronology, which directly addresses the question. Minor distractors include mention of a “knowledge graph” and some unnecessary commentary about clinical emphasis/worsening, but the content is largely on-topic."
