  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the core symptoms: sudden shortness of breath [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure the previous night and epilepsy [P-8], and fever of 37.4 described as mild [P-5], all matching the Gold Answer and transcript. Minor discrepancies include omitting the cough's sudden onset [D-2, P-2], the ~3-hour timing [P-11], explicit 'no sputum' phrasing, 'fine after seizure' detail [P-8], morning confirmation for fever [D-6, P-6], temperature units (°C), and pertinent negatives; it adds missed medication [P-9] which is factual but not emphasized in Gold as a symptom. No contradictions, core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: sudden SOB upon waking [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure previous night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], fever 37.4 mild [P-5]. Missed or partially covered: cough sudden morning [D-2, P-2], 3-hour onset [P-11], no sputum detail, 'fine after seizure and went to bed' [P-8], fever morning confirmation [D-6, P-6], units °C, all pertinent negatives. Covers core symptoms (~80-90% of key descriptive points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure/epilepsy [P-8], missed med [P-9], temp 37.4 mild [P-5]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around the question's elements (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, fever measurement) with bullet points matching categories; no off-topic content or tangents."
