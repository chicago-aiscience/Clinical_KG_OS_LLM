  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several accurate elements from the transcript (general weakness/run-down feeling [P-1, P-2], reduced intake/loss of appetite [P-2], headaches not worse than baseline [P-11], and generalized body aches [P-20]). However, it mischaracterizes an upper-respiratory symptom: it describes a “dry throat sensation” and cites [P-8], but [P-8] refers to a dry cough sensation (“feels dry like it's on its way”), not throat dryness. It also places headaches under “Sensory Changes,” which is a categorization error relative to the question/gold framing. Overall, it is partially correct but has notable inaccuracies/omissions.",
    "completeness": "It misses multiple key symptoms explicitly in the Gold Answer: loss of taste [P-4], diminished smell [P-6], subjective fever/feeling hot [P-4], mild sore throat [P-9], the presence of an incipient dry cough (it only emphasizes minimal coughing and misframes the dryness) [P-7, P-8], and the explicit denial of runny nose/congestion [P-10]. It also does not mention decreased appetite from the additional transcript points (e.g., not hungry [P-4]) or that headaches were likely usual stress headaches [P-12, P-13]. Coverage is well under ~50% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript and appropriately cited (weakness, reduced eating, headaches, achiness). The main faithfulness issue is the reinterpretation of [P-8] as “dry throat sensation,” which is not what the patient said; the dryness referred to the cough. No major fabricated symptoms are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic and structured around the requested symptom domains, but it fails to include several specifically asked-for symptoms (sensory changes like taste/smell; constitutional fever) and therefore only partially satisfies the question."

  "summary": "The answer is partly accurate and mostly grounded in the transcript, but it omits several major symptoms (taste/smell loss, subjective fever, sore throat, denial of congestion) and slightly misinterprets the “dry” symptom, resulting in low completeness and moderate correctness."
