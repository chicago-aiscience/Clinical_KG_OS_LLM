  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims the transcript contains only patient statements and no doctor statements, when in fact the transcript includes 38 dialogue turns, including several from the doctor (D-1 through D-38). The Generated Answer incorrectly concludes that there is insufficient data to answer the question.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the consultation with the attending physician, the potential for tests, or the plan to return shortly to discuss moving forward.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates a significant failure in faithfulness. It hallucinated the constraint that the transcript was missing the doctor's dialogue, despite the doctor's statements being clearly present in the provided source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question entirely, providing a summary of symptoms instead of the requested next steps, based on a false premise that the information was missing."
