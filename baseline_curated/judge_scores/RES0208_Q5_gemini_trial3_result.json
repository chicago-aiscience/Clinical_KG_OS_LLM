  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the connection between the grandson's illness and the doctor's assessment. However, it fails significantly on the second part of the question. It explicitly states that the transcript does not contain evidence of the doctor exploring travel or client visits, which is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about travel outside the province [D-24] and recent in-person client visits [D-32], both of which the patient denied.",
    "completeness": "The answer only covers the first half of the question regarding the grandson. It misses 100% of the key points from the Gold Answer regarding the exclusion of travel (outside the province) and occupational risks (financial advisor seeing elderly clients but not in the last few weeks).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is missing when it is present in the text. Furthermore, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not part of the provided source transcript, suggesting the model is bringing in external frameworks or hallucinating a source structure.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the first part of the question but provides a completely incorrect negative response to the second part, failing to address the user's inquiry about the other exposure pathways that were actually explored in the text."
