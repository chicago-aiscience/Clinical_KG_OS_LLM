  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and consistent with the transcript. It accurately identifies the baseline management, the 3-day window of decline, and the specific symptoms (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, fever, and dyspnea).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a few specific details found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention the patient's explicit statement that this is 'probably the worst that I've had' [P-3]. It also misses the quantitative comparison to prior exacerbations (two ER visits in three years with no hospitalizations [P-5, P-6]) which the Gold Answer uses to establish relative severity. It also omits the specific impact on her daily activity (dog walking) as a measure of decline.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are supported by the transcript. The use of 'decompensation' is a clinical interpretation but reflects the patient's description of her condition getting 'a lot worse'.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question: baseline to acute evolution, the direction of change (worsening), and a comparison of severity."
