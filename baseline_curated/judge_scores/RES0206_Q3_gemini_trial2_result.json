  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (fever, sick contact, cough, sputum, dyspnea) supporting the dual diagnosis. However, it attributes some of its reasoning to a 'knowledge graph' that was not provided in the source material. It correctly notes the role of fever and sputum in distinguishing infection, though some of the specific medical reasoning (e.g., 'infection moved into the airways') is clinical inference not explicitly stated in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points included in the Gold Answer: sinus pressure, mild headache, the patient's decreased exercise tolerance (difficulty walking the dog), the exclusion of environmental triggers (dust/smoke), and the exclusion of medication non-adherence. It covers approximately 60% of the specific evidence points cited in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'provided knowledge graph' and cites it for clinical information. While the symptoms themselves are in the transcript, the claim that information came from a knowledge graph is a significant hallucination of the context. The clinical interpretations provided are plausible but go beyond the explicit statements in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question: the symptoms supporting the dual assessment and the distinguishing role of fever and green-yellow sputum."
