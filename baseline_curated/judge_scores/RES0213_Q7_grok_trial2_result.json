  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer distorts the timeline by not starting with smoking at age 18, omitting escalation to 10 cigarettes/day over past 2 years and reduction a few months ago, skipping 8-year gap without anxiety, excluding father's heart attack, and failing to precisely link recent weeks' thesis stress escalation; it vaguely covers current stress/smoking quit, past anxiety (wrong citation), and chest pain onset but introduces contradictions like unspecified onset duration (despite P-2) and ignores specified sequence, leading to significant factual errors vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: chest pain onset ~1.5 weeks ago (partial), current stress/school busy, past anxiety (vaguely), pain when alone/studying; missed entirely: smoking start at 18, teen anxiety specifics/8-year gap, smoking escalation/reduction timeline, father's heart attack, precise 'last couple weeks' thesis time crunch; covers ~25-30% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly grounded (e.g., chest pain details [P-3,6], stress triggers [P-29], anxiety reference [P-20]); however, multiple hallucinations including 'Knowledge Graph' links ([MEDICAL_HISTORY], [SYMPTOM] causes), fabricated causal arrows not in transcript, and incorrect claim transcript lacks onset duration (contradicts P-2); citations accurate where used but unverifiable elements prominent.",
    "relevance": "Addresses timeline and phase relations somewhat (current stress/smoking to anxiety to chest pain), but deviates from question's specified sequence (smoking -> teen anxiety -> recent stress -> chest pain), includes off-topic Knowledge Graph fabrications, and lacks precise connections between phases."
