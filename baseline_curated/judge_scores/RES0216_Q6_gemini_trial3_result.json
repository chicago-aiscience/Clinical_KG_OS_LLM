  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's interpretation of the clinical assessment. It correctly identifies the primary differential (asthma) and the secondary/lower differential (cardiac ischemia). It also correctly identifies the specific physical exam component (lung auscultation) and the therapeutic trial of rescue puffers.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but omits the doctor's statement about consulting with the supervising physician ('the doc') before finalizing the plan, which is explicitly mentioned in both the transcript [D-35, D-37] and the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. It uses direct citations that correspond to the correct dialogue turns. It correctly attributes the patient's comment about symptoms feeling 'different' to the context of the assessment.",
    "relevance": "The response is perfectly relevant to the prompt, addressing the overall assessment, the physical exam components, the first-step treatment, and the contingency plan without including irrelevant information."
