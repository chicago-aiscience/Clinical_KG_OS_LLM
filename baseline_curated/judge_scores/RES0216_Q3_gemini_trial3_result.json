{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core diagnosis and the major symptoms (chest tightness, exertional triggers, lack of cardiac pain). However, it contains a minor factual error stating the patient 'takes' a rescue puffer [D-35]; the transcript [P-17] and [D-18] clarify that the patient has not refilled the rescue inhaler in years and does not currently have it. It also misses the specific reasoning regarding medication non-adherence (skipping evening doses), which is a key link in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of the Gold Answer's key points. It includes the history of asthma, presenting symptoms, cardiac exclusion, and the therapeutic trial. However, it misses several critical synthesis points: the medication non-adherence (skipping the evening dose), the lack of a rescue inhaler, the patient's own suspicion that it might be related, and the exclusion of new environmental triggers.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly faithful to the transcript, though it mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is not part of the provided source text. The claim that the patient currently 'takes' a rescue puffer is a slight hallucination/misinterpretation of the doctor's proposal to provide one [D-35] versus the patient's current status [P-17].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for symptoms, history, and the doctor's logic."
