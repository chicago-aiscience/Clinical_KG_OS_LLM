  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect compared with the Gold Answer. The transcript clearly contains doctor statements (e.g., [D-37]) in which the doctor explains the next steps (reviewing the case with the doctor working today, returning shortly to discuss tests/plan). The Generated Answer incorrectly claims there are no doctor statements and therefore concludes the next steps are not documented, directly contradicting the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are missed:\n- Doctor will review the gathered information with the doctor working today ([D-37]).\n- Another physician will be involved in decision-making/collaborative process ([D-37]).\n- Doctor will come back shortly to discuss next steps with the patient ([D-37], [D-38]).\n- Follow-up actions mentioned: possible tests and deciding how to move forward ([D-37]).\n- No specific tests/treatments were named yet (plan contingent on that discussion).\n- Patient acknowledged/agreed ([P-37]).\nThe Generated Answer provides unrelated symptom/history summary and does not cover the requested end-of-consultation plan. Coverage is essentially absent.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not well-grounded in the transcript because it makes a major incorrect assertion that the transcript contains only patient statements and no doctor dialogue. That claim is demonstrably false (multiple [D-] lines exist, including the relevant [D-37]). While the patient-symptom/history bullets are supported by the transcript, the central claim of “insufficient data due to no doctor statements” is unfaithful to the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically about next steps communicated at the end of the consultation (who is involved, what follow-up actions). The Generated Answer largely fails to address this and instead states it cannot be answered, plus adds a general summary of symptoms/history. This is only minimally responsive to the task."
