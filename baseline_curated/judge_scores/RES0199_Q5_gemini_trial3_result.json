  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It states that the doctor did not explore the patient's living situation, workplace, travel history, or sick contacts, whereas the transcript shows the doctor explicitly asking about each of these topics (D-45, D-47, D-48, D-49, D-50). It also incorrectly claims the only background information probed was smoking status, ignoring inquiries about environmental triggers (D-46) and other substances (D-43, D-44).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to include any of the key details from the Gold Answer, such as the patient living in an apartment [P-45], working at a car dealership [P-48], or the specific environmental triggers (mold, asbestos, etc.) that were ruled out.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the doctor failed to perform a systematic exploration. The transcript contains direct evidence of the doctor asking about the specific categories mentioned in the question.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the prompt but provides a false negative response. It fails to extract the relevant information requested from the source text, instead claiming it does not exist."
