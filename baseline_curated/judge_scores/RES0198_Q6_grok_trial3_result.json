  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript without errors or contradictions. Diagnosis matches precisely ('viral infection like/specific common cold'). Supportive care lists hydration and OTC Tylenol Cold exactly. Diagnostic test details (swab today/immediately, 48 hours) align, with 'rule out COVID-19' being a correct inference from context. Public health guidance matches verbatim. No factual inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: Diagnosis (covered); Supportive care - hydrated (yes), OTC Tylenol (yes), but misses 'symptoms take a few weeks to resolve' and 'not much beyond supportive care'; Diagnostic - pandemic context, swab today, 48h (yes); Public health - isolate home/not see others, further public health instructions (yes). Covers ~85% of key points, missing two expectation-setting phrases in supportive care.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-39]: diagnosis, hydration, OTC like Tylenol cold, swab today/48h, isolate/not see others, public health follow-up. Citations accurate. Minor phrasing like 'immediately' (for 'today') and 'rule out COVID-19' (inferred from 'symptoms can also be seen in covid patients') are grounded and plausible, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around the question's elements (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, public health), using bold headings and bullets for clarity. No off-topic content."
