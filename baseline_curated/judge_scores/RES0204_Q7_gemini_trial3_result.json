  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the timeline (4-5 days for cough, past couple of days for runny nose) and the nature of the symptoms (dry cough, clear nasal discharge). It correctly notes the cough severity remained consistent. The facts align with both the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points: the onset timing, the relative timing of the cough versus runny nose, and the severity of the cough. However, it misses a specific qualitative comparison from the transcript (P-24) mentioned in the Gold Answer: that the patient had never had a dry cough like this before and that previous runny noses never lasted this long. Instead, it focuses on fever and asthma history, which are relevant but less direct answers to how the 'current episode' compared to 'prior experiences with similar symptoms'.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript. The timing of 4-5 days [P-2], the runny nose timing [P-11], the lack of fever [P-13], and the asthma history [P-28] are all present in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, providing a structured timeline and comparing the current episode to the patient's history."
