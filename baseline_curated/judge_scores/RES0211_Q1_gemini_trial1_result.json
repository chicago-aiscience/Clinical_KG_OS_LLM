  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript contains no information regarding nausea, joint pain, or rashes, and claims Jessica did not deny them. In reality, the transcript explicitly shows Jessica denying rashes [P-10], nausea [P-11], and joint pain [P-13]. It also incorrectly claims she didn't explicitly deny sputum production, which she did in [P-5] and [P-6].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover a large portion of the Gold Answer. It misses the symptoms of feeling 'crappy/icky/malaise' and 'tired'. Most importantly, it fails to provide the list of denied symptoms requested by the prompt, instead claiming they are absent from the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a failure to ground itself in the provided transcript. It 'hallucinates' the absence of information that is clearly present in the text (specifically the doctor's questions and the patient's denials regarding nausea, joint pain, and rashes).",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it identifies some reported symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache), but it completely fails to answer the second half of the question regarding denied symptoms by claiming the information does not exist."
