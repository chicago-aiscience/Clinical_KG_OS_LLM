  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the management plan from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the COVID swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and all listed supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, rest, Tylenol/NSAIDs for symptoms). Minor discrepancies include omitting the 24-48 hour results timeframe, the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative, and the explicit note of no prescription medications beyond supportive care, but these do not alter core facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnostic test (COVID swab), self-isolation (14 days), contact tracing condition (if positive), all supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, antipyretics/Tylenol for fevers if any, Tylenol/anseads for aches). Missed: results timeframe (24-48 hours), alternative diagnosis mention, and explicit 'no other prescriptions'. Covers approximately 85-90% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations; no hallucinations or fabrications, even retaining the transcript's 'anseads' (likely transcription error for NSAIDs).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured and focused on directly addressing the question's specified components of the management plan with no off-topic content."
