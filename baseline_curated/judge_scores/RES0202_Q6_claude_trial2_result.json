  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer. All key facts are accurate: the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation period, possibility of false negatives, alternative diagnosis of another viral illness, and the specific warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells). The characterization as an 'infection' aligns with the Gold Answer's 'viral infectious process.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components from the Gold Answer: diagnostic test and turnaround time, isolation period, false negative possibility, alternative diagnosis, and warning signs with examples. However, it omits the specific detail about isolating 'from his younger sister if possible' [D-44] and the nuance about asthma being considered if only cough/shortness of breath without fever were present [D-45]. It also doesn't explicitly mention the watchful waiting approach or absence of prescribed medications, though these are implied.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer appropriately references [D-44] and [D-45] for all key points. No hallucinated content is present. The formatting and organization differ from the source but all substantive content is grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the complex multi-part question: diagnostic test with turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negative possibility, and warning signs with examples. The answer is well-organized and stays focused on these specific elements without tangential content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-structured response that addresses all major components of the question. It correctly identifies the COVID swab test (24-48 hours), 14-day isolation, alternative viral illness diagnosis, false negative possibility, and specific warning signs. Minor details about isolating from the sister and the fuller context about asthma consideration are omitted, slightly reducing completeness. However, all information provided is factually accurate and faithfully grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations."
