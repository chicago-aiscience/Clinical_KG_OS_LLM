  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all the key factual elements from the Gold Answer. The diagnosis is correctly stated as 'most likely a viral infection like the common cold.' The supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold) are accurate. The diagnostic test (COVID swab) with 48-hour results is correctly identified. The public health guidance (isolation until results, further instructions from public health) is accurately stated. All facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript [D-39].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components present in the Gold Answer: (1) the working diagnosis, (2) both supportive care recommendations (hydration and OTC medications), (3) the diagnostic test with timing details, and (4) the public health guidance including isolation and awaiting further instructions. The Gold Answer mentions that symptoms can take 'a few weeks' to resolve and that there's 'not much beyond supportive care available' - the Generated Answer omits these contextual details but captures all essential management plan elements. Coverage is approximately 95% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-39]. The diagnosis, supportive care measures, COVID swab order, 48-hour timeframe, isolation instruction, and public health follow-up are all explicitly stated by the doctor. The answer provides accurate citations [D-39] and does not include any information not found in the source material. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question, which asks for the complete management plan including diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance. All content is relevant and organized according to the question's structure. There are no tangents or irrelevant information. The answer is well-focused on the end-of-visit management plan."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent response that accurately captures the doctor's complete management plan. It correctly identifies the viral infection diagnosis, both supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold), the COVID swab test with 48-hour results, and the isolation/public health guidance. All information is factually accurate and grounded in the transcript. Minor deductions in completeness for omitting contextual details about symptom duration expectations, but all essential management elements are covered."
