  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: The Generated Answer correctly notes dry cough [P-12] and two vomiting episodes [P-32], matching Gold and transcript. It inaccurately claims no specific frequency for diarrhea episodes, contradicting [P-28] ('five or six times a day') and Gold. For headache severity, it cites 'pretty persistent' [P-3] and 'really sick' [P-1], but Gold/transcript specify a 7/10 rating [P-8], making this a mismatch. Lists symptoms accurately but omits headache categorization despite question. Significant factual errors/contradictions on key specifics warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: respiratory (dry cough start/characteristics/negatives), GI (diarrhea start/freq/liquid/no blood, nausea/vomit details/negatives), headache (start/persistent/location/7/10/no radiation/stiffness/unusual), loss of smell, fatigue. Generated covers symptom lists (nausea/vomit/diarrhea/cough), dry cough nature, vomiting number; misses diarrhea frequency/timeline/type, full headache details/severity, all negatives, timelines, loss of smell/fatigue. Covers ~25-40% of key points (basic symptoms + 2/4 specifics partially). Score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: symptoms in [P-1/P-28/P-32], dry cough [P-12], vomiting count [P-32], persistent headache [P-3], 'really sick' [P-1]. Citations accurate. Error on diarrhea frequency absence is a misreading/oversight, not hallucination; no fabricated facts beyond that. Mostly grounded with minor unverifiable detail (frequency denial). Score 4.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around GI/respiratory symptoms and exact specifics requested (cough nature, diarrhea freq, vomiting number, headache severity). No tangents or off-topic content; perfectly focused on question despite incompleteness. Score 5."
