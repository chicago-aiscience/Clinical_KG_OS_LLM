  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct regarding Tums and the change in the reflux regimen. However, it completely omits Avodart (dutasteride), which the patient explicitly states he takes for his enlarged prostate in turns P-25 and P-26. By presenting 'Current Medication' as only Tums, it provides an inaccurate picture of the patient's full medication list.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers about 60% of the required information. It successfully addresses the reflux medication (Tums), the specific change (stopping the previous prescription), and the reason (dietary management). However, it fails to mention the first medication mentioned in the transcript (Avodart) and its associated condition (enlarged prostate).",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is grounded in the transcript (specifically turn P-27). There are no hallucinations; the error is one of omission rather than fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question asked without adding extraneous information, although it is incomplete."
