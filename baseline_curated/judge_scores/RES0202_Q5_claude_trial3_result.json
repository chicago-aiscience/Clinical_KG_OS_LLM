  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns well with the Gold Answer. Both correctly identify that school attendance was central to the suspected source, that the mother raised COVID concerns related to school, that symptoms began Wednesday after school, that there were no known sick contacts outside of school, and that the school had not notified them of exposures. The Generated Answer accurately quotes and references the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer including: school as suspected source, timing of symptom onset after school, no sick contacts outside school, lack of school notification about exposures, and the mother's concern about COVID from school. However, it does not mention: (1) the school's requirement for COVID test results to inform other families [P-41], (2) the explicit ruling out of travel history [D-40/P-40], and (3) the ruling out of environmental home exposures [D-37/P-37]. These are relevant context points for narrowing the source to school.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer appropriately uses quotes from [P-2], [P-1], [P-38], and [D-44]. There are no hallucinated facts. The characterization that it's 'hard to say' about school contacts is accurately quoted from [P-38]. The answer stays grounded in what was actually stated in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about how school attendance factored into the suspected source and what the mother reported about sick contacts at school versus outside school, including school notifications. The answer is well-focused on these specific aspects with minimal tangential content. The structure clearly separates 'Suspected Source,' 'Known Sick Contacts,' and 'Notification' which directly maps to the question components."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate and well-grounded response that directly addresses the question. It correctly identifies school attendance as central to the suspected source, accurately reports the mother's statements about sick contacts (none outside school, uncertain at school), and confirms no school notification of exposures. All claims are verifiable with appropriate transcript citations. The answer loses a point on completeness for omitting three contextual details from the Gold Answer: the school's COVID test requirement for return, and the explicit ruling out of travel and home environmental exposures. These additional points help fully narrow the suspected source to school-based exposure."
