  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the nephew in daycare [P-11] as the exposure source, matching Gold. It links this to viral symptoms [P-1, D-39], consistent with Gold's viral URI assessment. Diabetes is noted [P-23, D-25], aligning with Gold. However, it introduces a 'Knowledge Graph' not present in Gold or transcript, a minor discrepancy. No contradictions; core facts match.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: exposure source (nephew daycare [P-11]), relation to viral symptoms [D-39], diabetes [P-23]. Missed: patient lives with nephew (implied in [P-11]), daycare as common source explicitly, nephew not sick but still possible [P-12], no explicit doctor link to immune function/ infection risk, diabetes details (age 7 [P-24], endo [P-26]), no other meds/allergies/hosp [P-27-29], symptoms duration [P-1,2]. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: nephew daycare [P-11], symptoms [P-1], doctor viral [D-39], diabetes/insulin [P-23, D-25]. 'Knowledge Graph' is hallucinated/not in transcript. Causal link from daycare to cold is plausible inference but attributed falsely to KG. 'Clinical documentation emphasizes adherence while managing acute' is loosely grounded. Some unverifiable but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly identifies exposure source and links to presentation (viral symptoms). Addresses diabetes in context of management during consultation. Does not deeply engage immune function impact as per question, but stays on-topic without off-topic content."
