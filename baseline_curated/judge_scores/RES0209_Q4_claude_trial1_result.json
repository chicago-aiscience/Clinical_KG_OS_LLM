    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly identifies 'chest tightness' as screening for infectious causes when this was actually screening for asthma symptoms. It mischaracterizes D-29's health problems question as infection screening when it was general medical history. Most critically, it omits the majority of infectious screening questions asked (recent colds/infections, loss of taste/smell, fevers, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, sick contacts at home, sick contacts outside home, and recent travel) and the patient's 'no' responses to all of these. The Generated Answer also incorrectly includes pollen/cold air triggers as part of infectious screening when these were allergy/asthma trigger questions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions only 1-2 of the 10+ specific infectious screening questions documented in the Gold Answer (symptoms: recent colds, taste/smell loss, fevers, nausea/vomiting, belly pain; exposures: sick household contacts, sick contacts outside home, travel). It correctly identifies the COVID swab plan but omits the rationale provided by the clinician. The systematic nature of the infectious screening described in the Gold Answer is completely absent from the Generated Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple claims not supported by the transcript. Chest tightness (D-20) was asked to assess asthma severity, not to screen for infection. The question about 'other health problems' (D-29) was general medical history, not infection-specific screening. The Generated Answer fabricates a connection between these questions and infectious disease screening that does not exist in the transcript. It also inappropriately includes allergy/asthma triggers (pollen, cold air) as part of infection screening responses, which misrepresents the clinical encounter.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question but misses the core focus. The question specifically asks what the doctor screened for to rule out infectious causes, the patient's responses, and the planned test. While it mentions the COVID swab, it fails to identify most of the actual infectious screening questions (fevers, taste/smell loss, sick contacts, travel, etc.) and instead includes irrelevant information about asthma triggers and general health history that were not part of infectious disease screening."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misidentifies what constitutes infectious disease screening in this clinical encounter. It incorrectly labels asthma symptom assessment (chest tightness) and general medical history questions as infection screening, while omitting the actual systematic infectious screening documented in the transcript (recent infections, COVID-specific symptoms like taste/smell loss, fevers, GI symptoms, exposure history including sick contacts and travel). The answer covers less than 20% of the key screening elements and contains factual errors that misrepresent the clinical reasoning. While it correctly identifies the planned COVID swab, the overall response lacks the completeness and accuracy needed to properly answer the question."
