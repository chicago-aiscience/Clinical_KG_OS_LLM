  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer, including the persistent dry cough (4-5 days, non-improving), chest X-ray rationale ('better look' [D-37]), and COVID swab as standard protocol ([D-39]). It correctly notes some pertinent negatives (e.g., no fever/chills [P-13], normal taste/smell [D-10/P-10], no chest pain [P-15], no nausea/vomiting [P-16]). Minor discrepancies include interpretive additions like denials 'ruling out' other emergencies (not explicitly causal in Gold) and framing family asthma history as 'lack of asthma history' (Gold specifies grandparents). No contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: present symptoms (dry cough details), some negatives (fever/chills, taste/smell, chest pain, muscle pain indirectly, nausea/vomiting), X-ray reason (persistent cough prompting better look), COVID protocol. Mentions new onset cough and family asthma indirectly. Misses: explicit clear runny nose as present symptom, full list of negatives (sore throat [P-9], headaches [P-18], abdominal pain [P-17], back pain explicitly, no sick contacts [P-19/P-22], no travel [P-20]), and 'absent high-acuity markers' phrasing. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-2], [D-37], [D-39], [P-15], [P-13], [P-28]). Patient's normal taste/smell directly stated [P-10], not just inferred. Interpretations like 'new onset issue' and 'physical activity without wheezing' match [P-24, P-28]. No hallucinations; minor plausible inferences grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by explaining how present (persistent cough) and absent findings (negatives ruling out alternatives) in clinical context led to both tests, structured by test type with transcript support. No off-topic content."
