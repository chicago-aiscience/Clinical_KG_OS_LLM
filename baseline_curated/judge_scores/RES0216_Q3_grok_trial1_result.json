  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript on core elements: patient's asthma history [P-16], symptoms of diffuse chest tightness and dyspnea on exertion [P-1, P-7, P-9, P-10], absence of cardiac pain or alarming features [P-1, P-5, D-36], and doctor's proposal of asthma recurrence as top differential with rescue inhaler trial [D-35]. It correctly notes symptom correlation to asthma and differentiation from ischemia. However, it introduces minor discrepancies by referencing a 'knowledge graph' (absent from Gold and transcript) and inaccurately attributes 'maintenance inhaler' directly to D-35 (though implied from earlier dialogue). Critically, it omits the doctor's emphasis on medication non-adherence [D-34, P-17-19] as a linking factor, but no outright contradictions exist.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: (1) asthma history [P-16, P-29] - yes; (2) medication limiting/skipping evening dose and no rescue refill [P-17-19, D-34] - missed; (3) exertional chest tightness/difficulty breathing [P-1,7,9,10] - yes; (4) patient notes different but possibly related [P-16] - partially (mentions asthma but not nuance); (5) no environmental triggers [P-33] - missed; (6) absence cardiac indicators [D-36] - yes; (7) therapeutic trial [D-35] - yes. Covers ~60-70% of points, missing medication non-compliance (central to linking) and triggers/patient nuance.",
    "faithfulness": "All transcript claims and citations are verifiable and accurate (e.g., chest tightness [P-1/P-5], SOB [P-7], asthma [P-16/P-25], cardiac diff [D-36], rescue plan [D-35]). Patient's salbutamol use aligns with asthma treatment context. However, 'knowledge graph information' and its 'classification of salbutamol' are entirely absent from transcript, introduced twice as basis for reasoning—clear hallucination, though plausible externally. Minor stretch on 'doctor noted maintenance inhaler [D-35]' (inferred, not explicit). Mostly grounded with some unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured to address the question: sections on symptoms/clinical features, medical history, and explicit 'how the doctor linked' via correlation, differentiation, and management strategy, with no tangents or off-topic content."
