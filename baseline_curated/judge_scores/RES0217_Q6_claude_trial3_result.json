  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures all major factual elements correctly: tick species identification via lab testing, Lyme serology blood work, physical exam, prophylactic antibiotics due to >72hr attachment, physician consultation, and preventive garden advice including insecticide use and tick habitat description. The reference to continuing statin medication is a minor addition not explicitly stated in the Gold Answer but is factually supported by the transcript. No significant factual errors or contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key components from the Gold Answer: (1) physical exam of bite site, (2) tick specimen laboratory identification, (3) blood work for Lyme serology/titres, (4) prophylactic antibiotics with 72-hour reasoning and geographic risk context, (5) physician consultation indicating trainee-supervised encounter, and (6) preventive advice about tick habitat (long grass, woods-field intersection, waving motion) and insecticide recommendation. The answer includes the additional detail about continuing statin medication, which while not in the Gold Answer, doesn't detract from completeness. Covers approximately 100% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The tick lab identification [D-5, D-18], blood work [D-18], physical exam [D-18], >72hr timeframe reasoning [D-6], geographic risk from Strathroy [D-13], physician consultation [D-18, D-22], and preventive advice about tick habitats and insecticide [D-18] are all directly sourced. The mention of continuing statin is based on [D-14, D-15]. No hallucinated content is present. All citations are accurate and verifiable.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the multi-part question: diagnostic tests (laboratory and physical), treatments, physician consultation, and preventive advice about garden/outdoor environment. Every section is focused and pertinent to the question. The minor addition about continuing statin medication, while not requested, is relevant to 'prescribed or recommended treatments' and doesn't constitute off-topic content. The answer maintains perfect focus on the clinical plan components."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer excellently captures all components of the doctor's comprehensive clinical plan with complete accuracy. It correctly identifies all diagnostic tests (tick species lab identification, Lyme serology blood work, physical exam), prescribed treatments (prophylactic antibiotics with proper 72-hour reasoning), planned physician consultation, and preventive advice (tick habitat description and insecticide recommendation). All claims are faithfully grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer demonstrates superior organization and completeness, covering 100% of the Gold Answer's key points while maintaining perfect relevance to the multi-part question. The minor addition about continuing statin medication is factually supported and does not detract from the overall quality."
