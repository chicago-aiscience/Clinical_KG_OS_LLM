  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly links Jessica’s dry cough, subjective fever/feeling hot, scratchy throat, and headache to a typical URI picture and appropriately notes that a non-productive cough (no phlegm) leans away from a productive lower respiratory process. It also correctly uses the absence of GI symptoms and joint pain as features that make alternative/systemic presentations less likely. However, it introduces an unsupported claim that a “knowledge graph explicitly defines dry cough and fever as indicators” and suggests these are “sufficient” for URI—this is not in the transcript or Gold Answer and overstates diagnostic sufficiency. It also mis-cites D-58 as if it contained the doctor’s question about sputum; the sputum questions occur earlier (D-4/D-5/D-6 with P-5/P-6 responses).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: scratchy throat preceding cough; dry cough; subjective fever/feeling hot; headache; no sputum/phlegm; no nausea/vomiting/diarrhea; no joint pain. Key points missed or underemphasized: the typical 3–4 day URI timeline as an explicit rationale; malaise (D-15) and fatigue (P-13) as part of the constellation; household exposure (brother had a cold a few weeks prior); explicit mention that the doctor summarized and framed next steps (D-58) as supporting the assessment. Overall coverage is substantial but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the provided transcript: repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and that it ‘defines’ indicators; the claim that dry cough+fever are “sufficient” for URI; and an incorrect citation placing the sputum-question content at D-58. Most symptom statements themselves are grounded in the transcript, but the added framework and some citation inaccuracies reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on explaining how the symptom pattern (present symptoms plus notable negatives) supports a URI assessment, which directly answers the question. Aside from the unnecessary ‘knowledge graph’ tangent, content is relevant."
