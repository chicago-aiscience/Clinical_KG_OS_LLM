  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the key clinical features assessed and found absent (bullseye rash [D-6/P-6], joint pain [D-7], fever/illness [D-8], headaches [D-19]) matching the Gold Answer's core facts. It correctly describes proposed tests (tick ID [D-6/D-18], serology [D-18], physical exam [D-18]) consistent with Gold. Minor additions like 'Ixodes species' align with 'deer tick' [D-5] but are not verbatim; no contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers all main clinical features from Gold (rash, joint pain, fever/illness, headaches); misses explicit mention of 'feeling well otherwise' [D-18/P-18] and 'no other bites' [P-9], and supervising physician consult [D-13/D-22]. Covers all three primary tests (tick ID, serology, physical exam) but omits note on no test results; approximately 85-90% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [D-6], [D-7], [D-18]). 'Ixodes species' is a plausible expansion of 'deer tick' [D-5] but not explicit; mention of 'provided knowledge graph' is not in transcript (minor hallucination). No major fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Directly and comprehensively addresses the question by structuring response around assessed absent features of active Lyme and proposed tests, with no off-topic content."
