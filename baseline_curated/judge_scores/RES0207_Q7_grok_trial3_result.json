  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core sequence: missed Keppra dose leading to seizure the previous night (P-9, P-23, P-8), feeling fine after and going to bed (P-8), sudden shortness of breath and dry cough upon waking that morning (P-1, P-2, P-4), temperature check of 37.4°C that morning (P-5, P-6), and decision to seek care due to respiratory symptoms (P-1). Minor discrepancies include omitting the specific daughter's birthday celebration as the reason for missing the dose (P-24) and the ~3-hour onset estimate for symptoms (P-11), but no factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: evening missed dose/seizure/fine after bed, morning SOB/cough onset upon waking, temp check, decision to seek care. Missed: daughter's birthday disrupting routine (P-24), symptoms ~3 hours before consultation (P-11), never experienced SOB before (P-3), uncertainty if seizure related (P-8). Covers ~75% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims (P-8 seizure last night/fine after, P-9 missed med, P-23 Keppra, P-1 SOB/decision, P-4 dry cough, P-5 temp) are directly verifiable in transcript. Inferences like missed dose causing seizure are patient-stated (P-9). Minor unverifiable details: references to 'Knowledge Graph' and entity relationships (e.g., [TREATMENT] Keppra for epilepsy, missed dose --> seizure), which are not in the transcript but plausible and grounded in stated facts (epilepsy P-8, Keppra P-23). No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly reconstructs the requested timeline from evening before (seizure context) to consultation time, explicitly including seizure, respiratory onset, temp check, and care-seeking decision, with clear chronological structure and no significant off-topic content."
