  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states symptoms began about a week prior and includes both congestion and rhinorrhea. However, it incorrectly characterizes the symptom pattern as “on and off rather than constant,” contradicting the patient’s direct clarification that symptoms were “pretty constant for the past week” [P-8]. It also misattributes the shift in predominant symptom to [P-10] (“I guess my nose is runny now”) rather than the clearer and earlier statement “now it’s mostly running” [P-3]. The initial symptom being congestion is correct, but the justification using decongestant use/sequence is not accurate compared with the explicit statement in [P-3].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements that are covered: ~1 week duration; congestion first; later predominance of runny nose. Key elements missed or inadequately handled: (1) the important clarification that despite initial “on and off” phrasing, the symptoms were overall constant for the week [P-8]; (2) that symptoms were not improving, prompting the visit [P-1]; (3) the shift from congestion to rhinorrhea is best supported by [P-3], and the partial role of decongestants is not clearly incorporated as in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Includes content not grounded in the transcript, such as referencing a “knowledge graph” and implying a specific temporal sequence (“before the interview progressed…”) that is not stated. It also omits/contradicts a key transcript fact by concluding symptoms were intermittent (“on and off”) without acknowledging the later correction to constant [P-8]. Overall, multiple claims are not well-supported or are contradicted by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the requested timeline: onset, first symptom, change in predominant symptom, and constant vs intermittent pattern. However, the constant/intermittent portion is incorrect and it does not fully describe the progression as asked (e.g., the clarification from intermittent-sounding to constant)."
