  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the infectious source (nephew in daycare) and the chronic condition (Type 1 Diabetes). It correctly links the daycare exposure to the viral diagnosis. However, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the provided source material. It also characterizes the brief check on insulin as 'management' of the condition, whereas the gold answer more accurately notes that the doctor did not explicitly link the diabetes to the current infection risk or immune function.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main points: the exposure source, the diagnosis, and the chronic condition. It misses the specific nuance mentioned in the gold answer that the nephew being 'fine' does not exclude him as a source. It also misses the gold answer's observation that the transcript lacks an explicit discussion of immune implications by the physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a source called 'Knowledge Graph' to support its claims. While the medical logic is sound, referencing a source not provided in the transcript is a breach of faithfulness. The rest of the information (P-11, P-1, D-39, P-23, D-25) is accurately grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question regarding the exposure source and the chronic medical condition."
