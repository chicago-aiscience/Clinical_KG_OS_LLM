  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the patient's activities and the doctor's calculation of the 72-hour duration from the transcript. However, it contains a major factual error by stating that the information regarding Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map is not present. This information is explicitly found in segments [D-12] and [D-13].",
    "completeness": "The answer only covers the first part of the question regarding the 72-hour duration. It fails to answer the second part concerning the geographic risk justification, instead incorrectly claiming the information is missing from the source text.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer exhibits a 'hallucination of absence.' It claims the doctor's justification relied solely on duration and prior history, whereas segment [D-13] explicitly shows the doctor using the distribution map to justify antibiotic prophylaxis.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the first half of the prompt regarding time duration but fails to provide any relevant content for the second half, offering an incorrect negative response instead."
