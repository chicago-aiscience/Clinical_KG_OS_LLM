  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer is largely inaccurate in identifying what was actually screened/denied. It wrongly foregrounds chest pain/generalized pain and fatigue as “constitutional symptoms” and treats cats/alcohol as exposure risks, neither of which are the key screening items in the Gold Answer. It does correctly note that TB is a serious consideration with a 3‑month cough and that constitutional symptoms like weight loss/night sweats are relevant to TB screening, but it fails to accurately report that the patient denied night sweats, weight loss/loose clothes, and hemoptysis, and it omits key exposure risk screens (travel, sick contacts, IV drug use). It also introduces unsupported clinical inferences (e.g., “green sputum indicates a bacterial component,” bronchiectasis/chronic bronchitis) and incorrectly suggests the doctor used these questions to rule out sepsis.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: mentions TB as a serious condition and generally references constitutional symptoms like weight loss/night sweats.\nKey Gold Answer elements missed: explicit denials of night sweats/soaked sheets, unexplained weight loss/loose clothing, and hemoptysis; exposure risks denied (sick contacts at class/recently/roommate, travel outside country/exotic locales, cocaine/heroin use, IV drug use); additional negatives (stiff neck, nausea/vomiting, body pain); serious conditions these help exclude beyond TB (endemic/travel-related chronic infections; reduced concern for lung malignancy via hemoptysis denial). Overall, it captures well under half of the required items.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “knowledge graph,” framing cats/alcohol as the relevant exposure risks, inference that green sputum indicates bacterial infection, and speculation about bronchiectasis/chronic bronchitis and sepsis exclusion. Several key transcript-grounded screening questions (night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis, travel, sick contacts, IV drug use) are omitted, and some transcript content is mischaracterized (e.g., pain/fatigue emphasis).",
    "relevance": "Partially addresses the second half (TB/chronic infection consideration) but largely fails the first half of the question, which asks for the specific constitutional symptoms and exposure risks screened for and denied. Includes tangential/irrelevant material (cats, alcohol, “knowledge graph”) and misses most of the requested screening items."

  "summary": "The answer mentions TB broadly but omits or misidentifies most screened/denied constitutional symptoms and exposure risks, and it adds several ungrounded claims, resulting in low overall alignment with the Gold Answer."
