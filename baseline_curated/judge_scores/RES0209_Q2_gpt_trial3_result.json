  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Gold: only asthma med is a bronchodilator rescue inhaler, used PRN, administered via puffer; clinician asked about an every-day controller/maintenance med and patient does not have one.\n- Generated: correctly identifies bronchodilator and that it’s a “puffer” (inhaler).\n- Errors:\n  - Claims the transcript does not contain dialogue where the doctor asks about a daily controller medication—this directly contradicts D-5 (“do you have one that you take every day no matter what?”) and P-5 (“No, I don’t have that one.”).\n  - Uses P-12 (“never been formally diagnosed”) as evidence for controller-med status; in transcript this refers to allergies, not asthma, and the patient *was* diagnosed with asthma at age 8 (P-2).\n  - Introduces “Knowledge Graph” as evidence, which is not part of the transcript.\n  - Adds “such as an inhaled corticosteroid” (plausible example clinically but not stated in the gold answer or transcript as the specific type asked about).",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer vs Generated Answer:\n- ✅ Only medication is a bronchodilator/rescue inhaler: covered.\n- ✅ Administered via puffer/inhaler: covered.\n- ❌ Used on an as-needed basis: not clearly stated.\n- ❌ Clinician explicitly asked about a medication taken daily no matter what (controller/maintenance): missed/contradicted.\n- ❌ Patient denied any other medications: not included.\n- ❌ The significance of increased rescue use: not required by the question, but present in gold answer; not included.",
    "faithfulness": "- Several statements are not grounded in the transcript:\n  - “Knowledge Graph categorizes…” is fabricated relative to the provided source.\n  - “Transcript does not contain… doctor asks about a daily controller” is demonstrably false (D-5).\n  - “Lack of formal diagnosis” is misapplied (P-12 is about allergies; asthma diagnosis is explicit at P-2).\n- Some content is grounded (bronchodilator helps; puffer), but the answer contains multiple unfaithful claims.",
    "relevance": "- The response attempts to answer all parts of the question (current med, administration, missing daily controller).\n- However, it includes irrelevant/misleading justification (formal diagnosis/allergies; knowledge graph) and incorrectly states the doctor didn’t ask about a controller med.\n- Still largely focused on the asked medication details."
