  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies smoking as the cause of COPD (Gold calls it primary risk factor, minor wording difference) and cites [P-40] accurately; the chain of exposure [P-20], infection signs like sputum [P-1] and fever [P-9], and doctor's assessment [D-43] align with Gold. Minor discrepancies include calling it 'direct cause' vs. 'primary risk factor,' specifying 'respiratory infection' when transcript says 'an infection,' and omitting quit timing/diagnosis [P-7, P-40]. No major errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: smoking details/quit/diagnosis [P-40,P-7], persistent COPD/inhalers [P-26], exposure/close contact [P-20], infection signs (sputum [P-1], sinus [P-12], headache [P-14], fever [P-9]), patient self-suggestion [P-23], 3-day worsening [P-1], past pattern [P-3], doctor [D-43]. Generated covers smoking [P-40], exposure [P-20], sputum/fever [P-1,P-9], doctor [D-43]; misses quit/diagnosis/inhalers, sinus/headache/patient comment/past pattern/3-day timeline (covers ~50-60%).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like smoking [P-40], exposure [P-20], sputum [P-1], fever [P-9], doctor on infection/exacerbation [D-43] verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. Hallucinations: 'Knowledge Graph' causal links (not in transcript, fabricated twice); doctor 'confirms respiratory infection' (transcript says 'an infection'). Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the two-part question on smoking-COPD relation and sick contact chain to exacerbation; structured response with no off-topic content."
