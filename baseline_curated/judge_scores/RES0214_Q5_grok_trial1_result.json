  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the husband's similar week-long illness as prioritizing COVID-19 (citing P-19 and D-53, matching Gold), the lack of flu shot keeping influenza possible (D-53/D-54, matching Gold), but underemphasizes the shared household with limited outside contact as supporting household transmission over independent exposures (Gold's second key point with citations P-17/18/22/23/42); adds extraneous symptom overlap but no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: husband's symptoms/household transmission (100%), no flu shot making flu possible (100%); missed/downgraded: detailed limited outside contact (work from home P-23/42, staying home P-22, hiking P-18, no other sick contacts P-17) as evidence against independent exposures (significant omission, ~60-70% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims verifiable (husband P-19/P-20/D-51/D-53, flu shot P-53/D-53/D-54, isolation D-53/D-54); hallucinations include repeated 'Knowledge Graph [KG]' references (e.g., sick contact indicates COVID, symptom overlap [KG]), not in transcript; symptom overlap plausible from P-1/D-53 but attributed to non-existent KG.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses epidemiological factors' influence on COVID vs. flu differential (husband → COVID priority, no flu shot → flu possible), with minor tangents on symptoms, KG, and isolation not central to question."
