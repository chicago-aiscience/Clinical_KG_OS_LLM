  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with both the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the COVID swab, the 14-day isolation period, the condition for contact tracing (positive result), and all supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol, and NSAIDs/anseads). It preserves the phonetic typo 'anseads' from the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the gold answer: the expected timeframe for test results (24-48 hours), the mention of an alternative viral illness diagnosis if the test is negative, and the explicit note that no prescription medications were ordered. However, it addresses all specific categories requested in the prompt's 'including' clause.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using specific terms found in D-52. It does not hallucinate any information and cites the correct dialogue turn [D-52] for all points.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, focusing exclusively on the doctor's management plan as requested. It uses a clear structured format to address each component of the query."
