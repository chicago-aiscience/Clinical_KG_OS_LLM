  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline of hiking on Friday and gardening on Saturday from [P-1], discovery of the tick behind the left knee with soreness, redness, and tenderness [P-1], removal and presentation with the tick in a container [P-1], and the comparison to the prior ~10-year-ago bite with bullseye rash and antibiotics [P-3], noting less engorgement (current 'pretty small' and 'maybe a little bit' vs prior 'quite swollen') [P-3,P-4]. Minor discrepancies include omitting the patient's uncertainty about attachment timing and preference for hiking origin [P-1], doctor's >72-hour estimate [D-6], specific 'earlier today' discovery [P-1], tick embedded 'stuck pretty good' emphasized less, Strathroy location [P-12], and doctor's 'not like a grape' confirmation [D-4]; however, no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: hiking Friday [P-1], gardening Saturday [P-1], discovery due to soreness behind left knee with redness/tenderness [P-1], tick removal and container [P-1], current tick small/not much engorged [P-3,P-4], prior ~10y bullseye rash/antibiotics [P-3], prior swollen tick [P-3], current lacks bullseye [implied P-3,P-6], current local symptoms [P-1,P-6]. Missed or partial: Strathroy hiking location [P-12], uncertainty/hope re: hiking vs garden source [P-1], 'earlier today' discovery timing [P-1], tick in knee crease/joint [P-1,D-1], doctor's >72h estimate [D-6], doctor's engorgement 'grape' description [D-4], explicit 'not as much' engorgement contrast phrasing, no 'larger circle rash' [P-6]. Covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable in transcript: timeline activities [P-1], discovery symptoms/location [P-1], container [P-1], small tick [P-4/D-5 context], prior episode and comparisons [P-3], current symptoms [P-1]. Citations accurate (minor D-5 for small tick but content matches P-4/D-4). No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured perfectly around the question's two parts (timeline from Fri hiking through Sat gardening to discovery/presentation, and comparison of current local symptoms/engorgement to prior bullseye/antibiotic episode), with no off-topic content."
