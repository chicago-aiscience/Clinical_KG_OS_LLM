  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. The diagnosis is correctly stated as 'most likely a viral infection, specifically the common cold.' Both supportive care recommendations (staying well hydrated and using OTC medications like Tylenol Cold) are correctly identified. The diagnostic test (COVID swab) and timeline (48 hours) are accurate. The public health guidance (isolation and awaiting further instructions) is correctly stated. All facts align with the source transcript [D-39].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components present in the Gold Answer: (1) the working diagnosis, (2) both supportive care recommendations with specific details, (3) the diagnostic test with timing expectations, and (4) the complete public health guidance including isolation and follow-up instructions. The only minor omission is the explicit mention that symptoms 'can take a few weeks to fully resolve' and the acknowledgment that there is 'not much beyond supportive care available,' but these are contextual details rather than core management plan elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in [D-39]. The diagnosis, supportive care measures, diagnostic testing, and public health guidance are all explicitly stated by the doctor in that exchange. The citation [D-39] is consistently and accurately used throughout. No hallucinated information is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question, which asked for the complete management plan including diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance. The response is well-organized and focused entirely on these requested elements without extraneous information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent evaluation of the doctor's management plan with high accuracy and faithfulness to the source material. It correctly identifies the diagnosis, both supportive care recommendations, the diagnostic test with timeline, and complete public health guidance. The response is well-structured and directly addresses all components of the question. The only minor gap is the omission of expectation-setting details about symptom duration and limited treatment options, which prevents a perfect completeness score."
