  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer falsely claims the transcript contains only patient statements [P-1] to [P-35] with no doctor statements, directly contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate summary of [D-37] and [D-38] where the doctor explicitly outlines next steps, involvement of another doctor, and potential tests; this is entirely factually inaccurate with no alignment to Gold Answer facts.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: doctor will review info with 'the doctor who's working today' [D-37], collaborative decision-making, return shortly to discuss next steps/tests/management [D-37/D-38], no specific tests ordered yet, patient agreement [P-37]; Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead providing irrelevant patient symptom summary and refusing to answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of all [D-xx] statements despite full transcript including [D-37]/[D-38] with verbatim next-steps discussion; lists patient details but ignores doctor dialogue entirely, fabricating 'no physician dialogue' claim which is unverifiable and false.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for doctor's communicated next steps, decision-makers, and follow-ups at consultation end; Generated Answer dodges by claiming insufficient data due to 'missing' doctor statements, providing patient symptoms instead, thus failing to address the core query."
