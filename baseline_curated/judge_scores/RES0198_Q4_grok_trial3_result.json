  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition both parties wanted to rule out, citing P-1 and D-39, matching Gold's citations (P-1, D-2, D-39). Test is correctly 'covid swab' (D-39), turnaround '48 hours' (D-39), and instructions to isolate at home (D-39), aligning with Gold despite minor phrasing differences; no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points: condition (COVID-19 by both, with citations), test (swab), turnaround (48 hours), instructions (isolate at home); misses minor Gold details like 'today' for test, D-2 citation, and 'further instructions from public health,' but core 100% covered in structured response.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: patient's COVID concern [P-1], doctor's swab order, 48-hour results, isolation instructions [D-39]; accurate citations, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses all four question components in bullet-point structure with no off-topic content or tangents."
