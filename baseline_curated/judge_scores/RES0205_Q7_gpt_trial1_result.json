  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: onset ~2 weeks ago, initial flu-like symptoms early, productive cough with “whitish clear” mucus for ~4–5 days, then transition to a dry cough that persists, and chest soreness with excessive coughing. Minor issues: it does not state (as in the Gold Answer) that cough intensity and frequency stayed the same, and the phrasing “when the coughing is intense” slightly reframes the transcript’s “when I'm coughing too much,” but this is not a major factual contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) ~2-week duration, (2) early flu-like symptoms, (3) other symptoms resolved within ~3–4 days (in general terms), (4) mucus description and 4–5 day duration, (5) transition to dry cough and persistence, (6) chest soreness with coughing.\nKey elements missing from the Gold Answer: (1) sore throat timeline (first 2–3 days then resolved), (2) runny nose explicitly, (3) explicit statement that no fever occurred, (4) cough intensity stayed the same over 2 weeks, (5) cough frequency did not increase and estimate of ~3–4 times/hour, (6) spontaneous/no triggers, (7) negative COVID test at onset and staying home awaiting improvement. Overall, this is partial coverage of the requested “complete timeline.”",
    "faithfulness": "Statements included are supported by the transcript citations provided (2-week cough, early flu symptoms, 4–5 days of whitish-clear mucus, transition to dry cough, persistent cough, and cough-related chest soreness). No clear hallucinated clinical details are introduced; the ‘intense’ wording is a mild paraphrase of ‘coughing too much’ rather than a new claim.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on symptom progression and timeline (onset, mucus phase, transition to dry cough, resolution of other symptoms, current status). It does not add unrelated history or tangential content. However, it omits several timeline elements explicitly requested (intensity/frequency changes), which affects completeness more than topical relevance."
