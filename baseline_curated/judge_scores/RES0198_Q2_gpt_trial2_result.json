  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all queried elements: the patient tried OTC decongestants, felt they helped “a little bit,” and the clinician recommended an OTC product like Tylenol Cold. The added phrasing that symptoms were not fully resolved is consistent with the patient still reporting a runny nose and does not contradict the transcript.",
    "completeness": "It captures the Gold Answer’s key points directly tied to the question: (1) decongestants tried, (2) partial benefit (“a little bit”), and (3) recommendation of Tylenol Cold. It omits additional Gold Answer context (hydration/supportive care framing and expectation of a few weeks for resolution), which lowers completeness relative to the full Gold Answer content, though those details are not strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are grounded in the transcript: decongestants and partial effect are in [P-10], and Tylenol Cold is recommended in [D-39]. No clear hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers what was tried, perceived effectiveness, and the recommended OTC treatment; no meaningful tangents."
