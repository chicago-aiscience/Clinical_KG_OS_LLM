  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key potential exposure source as the nephew who attends daycare, aligning with the Gold Answer ([P-11]). It is also consistent with the clinician’s impression of a likely viral URI ([D-39]). However, it introduces an unsupported element (“According to the Knowledge Graph, daycare exposure is listed as a cause...”), which is not part of the transcript or Gold Answer, and it overstates a specific causal linkage using that non-transcript source. It also frames diabetes management as a consultation focus, which is generally consistent with the insulin/adherence questions but does not directly address immune-function implications as the Gold Answer notes were not explicitly discussed.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) daycare-attending nephew as plausible exposure; (2) patient has type 1 diabetes and is on insulin. Key points missed or under-emphasized: (1) that the nephew lives with the patient (shared household exposure); (2) that the nephew was reported not sick but this does not exclude transmission ([P-12]); (3) that the transcript does NOT explicitly link diabetes to increased infection risk/immune implications (Gold Answer explicitly notes this absence); (4) additional supporting history elements mentioned in Gold (endocrinologist follow-up, no other meds) are not included.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded in the transcript (nephew in daycare [P-11], viral infection assessment [D-39], type 1 diabetes [P-23], insulin adherence discussion [D-25/P-25]). However, the reference to a “Knowledge Graph” and its asserted causal relationship is not in the transcript and constitutes hallucinated/extra-source content. Overall the answer is mostly transcript-consistent but includes at least one clear non-grounded claim.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested elements: identifying a social-history exposure and relating it to the current URI-like presentation in the context of type 1 diabetes. The added “Knowledge Graph” reference is unnecessary but still within the topic."
