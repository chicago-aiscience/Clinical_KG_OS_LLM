  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the core information in the Gold Answer regarding the symptoms (loss of smell, taste, and cough), the doctor's statement on consistency, and the test method (swab).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key explanatory points present in the Gold Answer: 1) The fact that the patient initially raised the suspicion of COVID-19, 2) The doctor's systematic exclusion of other symptoms (fever, difficulty breathing, sore throat, etc.), and 3) The specific clinical reasoning that the narrow, isolated nature of these symptoms without systemic signs supported the testing decision.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript [P-1, D-39].",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question, identifying the symptoms and the connection to the test, although with less depth than the Gold Answer."
