  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: it claims the chronic cough onset duration is not specified (contradicting [P-3]'s 'probably had a cough for the last 10 years'), and reports COPD diagnosis as 'a couple years ago' [P-1] without the clarification to 'almost, probably five years ago' [P-2]. Acute elements are accurate: cough worsening and sputum change over the past week [P-1, P-5, P-6], and acute SOB over last few days [P-1, P-8] prompting visit.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: chronic cough ~10 years [P-3]; COPD ~5 years [P-2]; intermittent baseline SOB [P-8]; cough worsened ~1 week [P-1,P-5]; sputum yellow ~1 week [P-6]; SOB intensified few days [P-1,P-8]; chills couple days [P-29]. Generated covers: cough worsen week, sputum week, SOB few days (~40-50% coverage); misses chronic cough timing entirely, COPD timing (wrong), baseline SOB, chills.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly grounded in transcript: cough worsening [P-1,P-5], sputum [P-6], SOB [P-1,P-8], doctor's view [D-52]. However, incorrectly states chronic cough duration 'not specified' despite direct statement in [P-3]; COPD cites only initial vague [P-1], omits clarifying [P-2]. No major fabrications, but some inaccurate assertions about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question's timeline request with structured bullets matching exact elements (chronic cough onset, COPD diagnosis, cough/sputum worsening, acute SOB prompting visit); no irrelevant content or tangents."
