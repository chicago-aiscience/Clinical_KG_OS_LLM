  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the one-week duration and a shift from stuffy nose to runny nose, aligning with the Gold Answer's core progression. However, it inaccurately infers the initial symptom primarily from decongestant use [P-10] rather than the patient's direct statement [P-3], misattributes the 'on and off' description specifically to congestion (P-1 mentions both symptoms), and completely omits the patient's clarification that symptoms were 'pretty constant' [P-8], contradicting the Gold Answer's reconciliation of intermittency vs. constancy. These are significant factual errors relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1-week onset [P-1,P-2] (covered), initial stuffiness [P-3] (partially/inferred), shift to rhinorrhea [P-3] (covered via P-10), decongestant influence [P-10] (mentioned but repurposed), initial 'on and off' [P-1] (covered), constant clarification [P-8] (missed), no improvement [P-1] (missed). Covers about 50-60% of points, missing crucial frequency nuance and direct evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded: week duration [P-1], decongestants and runny now [P-10]. However, hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' linking decongestants to congestion (absent from transcript), infers initial symptom evidence from P-10 and interview progression (runny nose discussed early in P-1), and selectively uses P-1 for frequency while ignoring contradictory P-8, introducing unverifiable inferences and fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around onset, symptom order/shift, and frequency, precisely matching the question's requirements on progression, first symptom, change in predominance, and constancy/intermittency, with no off-topic content."
