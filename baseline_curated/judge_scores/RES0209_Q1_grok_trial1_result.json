  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the cough as dry and almost nonstop during the day (matches Gold and P-1, P-14), breathing difficulties as very short of breath with frequent bronchodilator use (matches Gold and P-1), and wheezing as occurring a lot (matches Gold and P-15). It correctly notes daytime persistence (P-1) and reduced nighttime frequency every other day or so (matches Gold and P-18). However, it omits the cough duration of two weeks (P-13), confirmation of non-productive cough, additional breathing difficulty details (hard time breathing, P-19; linked to severe wheezing, P-16), wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use (P-17), and entirely misses chest tightness (P-20), a key symptom in Gold. No contradictions, but these omissions create discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: dry cough character and daytime near-constant frequency (partial, misses 2-week duration and non-productive detail); breathing difficulties (SOB covered, misses 'hard time breathing' and severity link); wheezing presence and frequency comparison (presence covered, misses more frequent than meds); daytime vs. nighttime frequency (well covered). Missed entirely: chest tightness; cough duration; full breathing/wheezing details. Covers approximately 60-70% of key points (3/4 symptoms partially, freq well).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable: cough dry/nonstop day [P-1]; SOB and bronchodilator use [P-1]; wheezing a lot [P-15]; daytime persistent [P-1]; nighttime less frequent, every other/2 days [P-18, in context of symptoms including wheezing/cough]. No hallucinations or inaccurate citations; specifying 'nighttime wheezing' is plausible in context (post-wheezing discussion).",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured around the question's requirements (symptoms: cough character, breathing difficulties, wheezing; day/night frequency differences), with no off-topic content or tangents, directly using transcript evidence."
