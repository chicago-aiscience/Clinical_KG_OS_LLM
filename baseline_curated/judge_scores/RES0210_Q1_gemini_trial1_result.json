  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the color and appearance of the sputum, the location of the chest pain, and the presence of fever and chills. There are no contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific details provided in the gold answer. It does not mention that the chest pain was 'constant' and 'dull,' nor does it include the patient's report of mild dyspnea on exertion (feeling winded on stairs). It also omits the temporal progression of the cough (starting Friday, worsening Sunday) and the resolved runny nose.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the generated answer are supported by the transcript. The citations [P-5], [P-9], [P-17], [P-18], [P-6], [P-1], and [P-15] are used correctly to anchor the claims to the source text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's specific requests regarding symptoms, sputum description, chest pain, and systemic symptoms without including unnecessary information."
