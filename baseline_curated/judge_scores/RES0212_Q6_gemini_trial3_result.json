  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states that the doctor characterized the condition as a 'respiratory infection'. In the transcript [D-47], the doctor only summarizes the symptoms (duration, sputum color, lack of blood, and lack of constitutional symptoms) without providing a specific diagnosis. Additionally, it claims the doctor mentioned 'potential pain' in the final assessment, which is not present in the doctor's summary at [D-47].",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the core plan (reviewing the story with other doctors) and most of the symptoms summarized by the doctor. However, it misses the Gold Answer's observation that the next steps are specifically guided by the supervising physician's assessment, a nuance stemming from the trainee status of the speaker.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer heavily hallucinates an external 'knowledge graph' as a source of information, which was not provided in the context. It also attributes a diagnosis ('respiratory infection') to the doctor that is not found in the source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the user's question: the plan, the summary assessment, and the information guiding next steps."
