  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the three OTC medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) tried for chest pain with correct citation [P-6], matches the Gold Answer's report of ineffectiveness ('hasn't really helped very much' vs 'haven't really helped very much' - minor grammatical difference but same meaning), and correctly identifies the regular supplement as a multivitamin [P-25]. It omits Gold's additional non-medication details (stress management, smoking) but these do not affect factual consistency on meds/supplements. All facts fully consistent, no errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: three OTC remedies for pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) [P-6]; ineffective ('haven't really helped very much') [P-6]; daily multivitamin as only regular supplement [P-25]; no prescription meds [D-25,P-25]. Generated covers 100% of these core points with citations. Gold's extras (stress management [P-28], quitting smoking [P-13,P-14,P-18]) are contextual and not medications/supplements, so not required for completeness on the question's focus.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Tylenol/Advil/Alka-Seltzer and ineffectiveness in [P-6]; multivitamin in [P-25]. Citations accurate to transcript. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing OTC meds/supplements for pain treatment and routine (with citations), effectiveness, and nothing else. No tangents or off-topic content."
