  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a minor error regarding the duration of the cough, stating it has persisted for 'at least a month,' whereas the transcript and gold answer explicitly state 'three months.' It also includes eczema as an associated symptom, which is technically part of her past medical history rather than a symptom of the current respiratory issue. However, most other facts align with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete regarding the symptoms explicitly denied. The gold answer lists night sweats, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts as denied, all of which are absent from the generated answer. It also misses details like the initial dry nature of the cough, the specific onset during a dance class, and the lack of a foul smell in the sputum.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All symptoms reported and the two denials mentioned are directly supported by the text without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, structuring the response to specifically address the three parts of the prompt: respiratory symptoms, associated symptoms, and denied symptoms."
