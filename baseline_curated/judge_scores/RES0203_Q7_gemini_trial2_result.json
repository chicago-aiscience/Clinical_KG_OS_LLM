  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims there is 'no evidence' in the transcript regarding whether the patient experienced these symptoms before. In fact, the doctor explicitly asked this in [D-3] and the patient replied 'No, no, nothing like this' in [P-3]. The answer also vaguely states there was 'no specific indication' of fluctuation, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer explicitly state they were 'pretty consistent' [P-5, P-8].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to confirm that the symptoms began simultaneously relative to each other [D-6, P-6]. 2) It omits the detail that the loss of taste/smell was partial (could still smell strong odors and taste salty foods). 3) It fails to provide the specific 'consistent' status for the symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is poorly grounded in the transcript regarding the patient's history. It claims no evidence exists for prior symptoms and then cites [P-33] (alcohol consumption) in relation to a general health question, completely overlooking the direct evidence in [P-3].",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses all parts of the prompt (timing, progression, and prior history), although the content provided for those parts is incomplete or inaccurate."
