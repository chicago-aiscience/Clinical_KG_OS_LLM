  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main contributors consistent with the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (missed antiseizure medication dose) and (2) hereditary predisposition (maternal history of epilepsy). However, it slightly overstates causality by saying a missed dose is “directly causative” and that family history “causes the underlying condition,” whereas the transcript/Gold describe these as likely precipitating (missed dose) and predisposing (family history) factors rather than definitive causes. These are minor discrepancies; core facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers the key points from the Gold Answer: missed Keppra dose as likely trigger (P-9, P-23) and epilepsy in mother/family history (P-26), and connects family history to genetic predisposition underlying the patient’s epilepsy. It omits some supporting details present in the Gold Answer, including the specific reason for missing the dose (daughter’s birthday/routine disruption, P-24) and that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent (P-9). Overall it captures most, but not all, Gold details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (missed med, Keppra, mother with epilepsy). However, the repeated references to “the knowledge graph” and claims that it “establishes a causal link” are not present in the transcript and introduce unverifiable justification. Also, the definitive causal phrasing (“directly causative,” “causes the underlying condition”) goes beyond what the patient states (“I think that might have”). These issues reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on hereditary and medication-related risk factors and explicitly answers how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. No substantial irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "The answer is largely accurate and on-topic with good coverage of the main risk factors, but it adds unverifiable “knowledge graph” assertions and overstates causality, and it omits some supporting contextual details from the Gold Answer."
