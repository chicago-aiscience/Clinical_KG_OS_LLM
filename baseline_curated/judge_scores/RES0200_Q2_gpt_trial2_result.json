  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Ventolin/Spiriva: Correct that the patient uses Ventolin and Spiriva as respiratory inhalers.\n- Ventolin frequency: Incorrect. The transcript explicitly states the patient used Ventolin “almost like 10 times this past week” [P-12]. The generated answer claims the specific frequency was not stated.\n- Non-respiratory meds: Correct that the patient takes atorvastatin (“Torva Staten”) for high cholesterol [P-38].\n- Diuretic/BP med: Partly incorrect framing. The transcript indicates the patient *used to* take a diuretic for blood pressure but is *not taking it now* [P-34–P-36]. The generated answer incorrectly lists the diuretic as a medication the patient was “on” prior to the visit.\n- Discontinued medication: Correct that the patient stopped the diuretic without physician approval [P-36].",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer:\n- Current respiratory inhalers: Ventolin and Spiriva — Covered.\n- Ventolin use in past week (~10 times) — Missed/incorrect.\n- Current non-respiratory med: atorvastatin — Covered.\n- Previously prescribed BP med: diuretic — Covered.\n- Patient stopped diuretic without doctor approval — Covered.\nOverall, the central quantitative detail (Ventolin frequency) is missing, which materially reduces completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most medication mentions are anchored to transcript lines.\n- However, the statement that Ventolin frequency was not stated contradicts explicit transcript content [P-12].\n- The claim that the patient was currently “on a diuretic” is not supported; the transcript indicates it was discontinued [P-34–P-36].\nThus, there are multiple transcript-inconsistent assertions (beyond minor unverifiable details).",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on (1) pre-visit medications, (2) Ventolin usage frequency, and (3) the self-discontinued medication. Minor extraneous phrasing (“knowledge graph”), but overall it addresses the asked components."

  "summary": "The response identifies the inhalers and the discontinued diuretic, but it fails the key Ventolin-usage detail (10 times in the past week) and misstates the diuretic as a current medication, leading to low correctness and completeness."
