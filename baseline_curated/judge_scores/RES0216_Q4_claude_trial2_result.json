  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies 'cardiac ischemia' (cardiac ischemic picture) as the condition placed lower on the differential. It accurately cites the lack of pain and the nature of chest tightness. However, it mischaracterizes one key point: the doctor said the patient 'didn't really get out of breath with exercise' as evidence AGAINST cardiac ischemia, but the Generated Answer states it was about 'occurring...during physical activity' without clearly conveying this was cited as evidence for deprioritization. The Generated Answer also omits several pertinent negatives explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer (anxiety, sweating, impending doom).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: (1) cardiac ischemia as the deprioritized condition, (2) chest tightness vs pain distinction, and (3) absence of pain. However, it fails to mention: (1) the specific pertinent negatives of anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom that were screened [D-6, P-6], (2) the complete absence of classic exertional dyspnea pattern, (3) the patient's explicit relief statement about it not being their heart [P-35], and (4) the systematic screening process the clinician used [D-5, D-6].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [D-36, P-1]. However, there's an unsupported claim about a 'Knowledge Graph' that 'indicates that the absence of chest pain and the presence of chest tightness rule out cardiac ischemia' - this Knowledge Graph is not part of the provided source material and appears to be a hallucination. All other claims are verifiable in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question, identifying the specific condition (cardiac ischemia) and providing evidence for its deprioritization. The structure follows the question's format by covering both nature of complaints and absence of symptoms. The reference to an external Knowledge Graph is tangential but doesn't significantly detract from addressing the core question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemia as the deprioritized condition and cites valid evidence (tightness vs pain, absence of pain). However, it suffers from three main limitations: (1) incomplete coverage of pertinent negatives explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer (anxiety, sweating, impending doom), (2) slight mischaracterization of the exertional dyspnea evidence, and (3) inclusion of an unverifiable reference to a 'Knowledge Graph' not present in source materials. While addressing the question relevantly, it captures only about 60% of the key clinical reasoning points from the Gold Answer."
