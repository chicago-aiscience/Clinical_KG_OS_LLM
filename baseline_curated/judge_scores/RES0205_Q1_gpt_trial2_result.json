  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the core symptom course: a 2-week cough that persists and is currently dry (consistent with P-2, P-5, P-6), earlier mucus that has resolved (P-5, P-6), and chest discomfort/soreness related to coughing (P-15, P-16). The statement that initial “flu-like symptoms” resolved by day 3–4 is consistent with the patient’s description that other symptoms resolved in ~3–4 days (P-14). It does not introduce incorrect symptom claims; it adds background conditions (anxiety, reflux) that are true but not part of the symptom list requested.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: persistent cough x2 weeks; dry cough at present; earlier mucus that resolved; chest soreness with coughing; general statement that early ‘flu-like’ symptoms resolved. Key points missed from the Gold Answer: explicit listing of sore throat (first 2–3 days) and runny nose (first couple days); description of mucus as ‘whitish/clear’ and duration 4–5 days; current cough characteristics (approx. 3–4 times per hour, spontaneous/no triggers, stable intensity and frequency); pertinent negatives (no dyspnea, no fever, no N/V, no abdominal pain). Overall coverage is partial (~50–70% of Gold Answer symptom details).",
    "faithfulness": "All included symptom claims are supported by the transcript (P-2, P-5, P-14, P-15). The additional background conditions (anxiety, acid reflux) are also in the transcript (P-22, P-25). No clear hallucinations; main limitation is omission rather than invention.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on symptoms resolved vs persisting, which matches the question. However, it includes ‘Reported Background Conditions’ (anxiety, reflux) which are not symptoms of the two-week illness and are not asked for, representing minor tangential content."
