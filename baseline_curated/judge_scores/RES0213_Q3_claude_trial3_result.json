  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety-related chest pain as the diagnosis, which aligns with the Gold Answer's conclusion of 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' However, it uses slightly different terminology ('Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain' vs 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain'). The core factual content is consistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer: situational triggers (alone vs distracted), history of anxiety attacks, current stress from thesis, breathing changes during episodes, and patient's own consideration of stress. However, it omits some important details present in the Gold Answer: (1) specific mention of Masters thesis deadline and time pressure [P-15, P-16], (2) pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, pain at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety, no asthma), and (3) some specific citations like P-4, P-9 for situational patterns. Coverage is approximately 70-75% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations provided (P-29, P-19, P-20, P-13, P-8) are accurate and support the statements made. No hallucinated information is present. The answer is well-grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying the diagnosis and providing specific clinical observations that support the reasoning. The structure follows the question's format precisely. All content is relevant to answering what diagnosis the findings point toward and which observations support it."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety-related chest pain and provides accurate, relevant clinical observations from the transcript. Its main weakness is incompleteness - it omits important pertinent negatives and some specific details about the stressors that strengthen the diagnosis. All stated information is faithful to the source material with accurate citations."
