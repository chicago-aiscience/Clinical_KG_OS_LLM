{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer regarding the core symptoms: productive cough (yellow/red spots), fever, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain. It correctly identifies the transcript segments supporting these findings.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a few details present in the Gold Answer: specifically, the mention of chills [P-9] as a systemic sign and the pack-a-day smoking history [P-37, P-38] as a predisposing factor. It also omits the detail that the chest pain is constant/dull even at rest [P-20].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is grounded in the transcript, but it references a 'Knowledge Graph' multiple times, which was not provided in the source context. While the clinical information it attributes to the Knowledge Graph is found in the transcript, the reference to an external data structure is an artifact/hallucination of the model's internal processing.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both the specific findings pointing to pneumonia and the explanation of how pleuritic pain supports the diagnostic reasoning."
