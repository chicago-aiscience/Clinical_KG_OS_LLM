  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to both the transcript and the Gold Answer. The doctor *did* systematically explore exposure risks: living situation (apartment in city, lives alone), home/environmental triggers (old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets), sick contacts (asked about contact with anyone sick), workplace setting (asked where they work; asked if anyone at work was sick), and travel history (asked about recent travel). The Generated Answer incorrectly states these were not explored and claims the only background probed was smoking, which is directly contradicted by multiple transcript lines (D-45/46/47/48/49/50).",
    "completeness": "It misses essentially all key elements from the Gold Answer: living situation, environmental exposures, sick contacts, workplace details and workplace illness exposure, travel history, and the conclusion that no clear exposure source was identified. It only mentions smoking and COVID suspicion/contact tracing, neither of which answers the exposure-source question as asked and both omit the systematically explored sources listed in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is poorly grounded in the transcript because it asserts the absence of exposure-history questioning despite explicit evidence that such questioning occurred (D-45 to D-50). While its mentions of COVID suspicion and smoking are supported by the transcript, the central claim (no systematic exploration) is a major contradiction, making the response largely unfaithful to the provided source.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic in that it attempts to address whether/what exposure sources were explored, but it does so by incorrectly denying that the exploration occurred and therefore fails to provide the requested exposure categories (living situation, workplace, travel, sick contacts). Minimal tangential content (COVID suspicion) is included."
