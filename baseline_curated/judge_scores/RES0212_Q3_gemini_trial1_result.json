  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies a respiratory infection, which is consistent with the Gold Answer's more specific diagnosis of 'acute lower respiratory tract infection' or 'acute bronchitis'. However, it is less precise than the Gold Answer, which suggests possible bacterial superinfection or early community-acquired pneumonia. The generated answer accurately maps the symptoms to the patient's statements.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key nuances from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention that the acute symptoms are superimposed on a chronic three-month cough. 2) It does not explain the physiological significance of the findings (e.g., 'transition from irritation to active inflammation' or 'systemic inflammatory response'). 3) It misses the distinction the doctor makes between acute and more serious chronic conditions based on the absence of constitutional symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer accurately cites the transcript for the symptoms (P-2, P-4, P-9, D-47). However, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source materials. While the medical logic is sound, referencing an external source not in the prompt is a minor breach of faithfulness to the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's question by identifying the diagnosis and explaining the contribution of each of the three clinical features."
