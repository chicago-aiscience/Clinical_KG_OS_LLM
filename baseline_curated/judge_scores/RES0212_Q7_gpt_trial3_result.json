  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the major time anchors consistent with the Gold Answer: cough began ~3 months ago; nocturnal sleep disruption began ~1 month ago; productive greenish sputum began ~3 days ago; subjective fevers (“hot at night”) began in the past couple of days. No direct contradictions to the Gold Answer are present. Minor issue: it adds an interpretation about a “respiratory infection indicated by the knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript/Gold Answer and is not required for the timeline.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: (1) initial onset ~3 months; (2) sleep disruption ~1 month; (3) greenish productive sputum ~3 days; (4) subjective fevers in past couple days.\nKey points missed/under-specified vs Gold Answer: (a) the initial onset context (noticed during pole dancing class) is omitted; (b) the chronic phase description as dry/intermittent (“sometimes there, sometimes goes away”) is not stated; (c) sleep disruption detail that it was “pretty well every night” and explicitly not for all three months is not fully captured (only “kind of waking me up”).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by cited transcript lines. However, the mention of a “knowledge graph” and that it “indicated” a respiratory infection is not supported by the provided transcript and constitutes an ungrounded addition. Otherwise, timeline claims align with transcript (e.g., sputum ~3 days [P-12], feeling hot at night past couple days [P-4], nocturnal waking last month [P-21], cough for three months [P-2]).",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the requested cough timeline elements (onset, sleep disruption, green sputum onset, subjective fever onset) and does not substantially diverge from the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate and relevant, but it omits several descriptive timeline details (pole-class onset context, intermittent/dry phase, nightly frequency clarification) and includes a minor ungrounded “knowledge graph” infection inference."
