{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the core facts: the three triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen), the symptoms of the exacerbation, and the family history (sister). However, it attributes these links to a 'knowledge graph' which does not exist in the provided source materials. The clinical facts themselves align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main triggers and family history. It misses the specific quantification of the rescue inhaler increase (from once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week) which is a key indicator of the exacerbation mentioned in the Gold Answer. It also misses the detail that no other family members have allergies or breathing problems.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' ('The knowledge graph explicitly links...', 'According to the knowledge graph...'), which is a hallucination. There is no such graph in the transcript. However, the citations to the transcript numbers [P-1, P-9, etc.] are mostly accurate.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, structured well to address each component of the multi-part question (triggers, family history, allergies, and exacerbation)."
