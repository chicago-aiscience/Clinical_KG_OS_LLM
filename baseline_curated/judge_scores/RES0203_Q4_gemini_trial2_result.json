  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that several symptoms (dyspnea, sore throat, chills, muscle aches) were not explicitly denied or were only 'likely absent.' However, the transcript shows direct 'No' responses for each of these: [P-11], [P-13], [P-14], and [P-15]. The Gold Answer accurately identifies these as confirmed negatives.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key negative findings listed in the Gold Answer, including: no sputum/blood with cough [P-7], no environmental/cold triggers for cough [P-21], no medication use [P-24], no prior surgeries [P-25], and no relevant family history [P-27].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations regarding the structure and content of the transcript. It claims certain information is missing or only implied (e.g., the denial of sore throat and dyspnea) when that information is explicitly present in simple turn-by-turn dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and follows the requested structure, including the list of symptoms and a detailed clinical explanation, although the data used to form the list is partially inaccurate."
