  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer and transcript regarding the triggers (exercise, cold air, pollen), the family history (sister with asthma), and the current symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses some specific details found in the gold answer, such as the exact increase in inhaler frequency (once every two weeks to 5-6 times a week) and the fact that no other family members have known allergies or breathing problems. It also omits the clinician's specific suggestion regarding a 'little change to medications'.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer includes references to a 'knowledge graph' as a source for its claims. No knowledge graph was provided in the context—only a transcript. While the clinical facts are grounded in the transcript, the attribution to a non-existent 'knowledge graph' is a minor hallucination of source structure.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, relating the triggers and family history to the exacerbation and the suspicion of allergies."
