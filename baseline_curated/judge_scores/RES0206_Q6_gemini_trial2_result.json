    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key clinical facts from the transcript and the Gold Answer, including the physical exam components, the COVID swab, the consultation with the attending, and the criteria for admission/discharge.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses the doctor's preliminary clinical impression (COPD exacerbation/infection) which the Gold Answer included as part of the plan's context. It also omits the specific mention of 'temperature' as a key vital sign to be checked, though it mentions vital signs generally.",

    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the specific question regarding the comprehensive plan without adding unnecessary information."
