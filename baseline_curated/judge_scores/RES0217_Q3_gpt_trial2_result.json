  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies (a) the exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), (b) the clinician’s estimate that attachment could be >72 hours, and (c) the patient’s prior tick bite with a target/bullseye rash treated with antibiotics. However, it misstates the geographic risk assessment: in the transcript/Gold Answer, the doctor’s geographic concern came from Strathroy’s location on an Ontario Lyme distribution map (\"close enough to be considered...concerning\"), not from the general fact that deer ticks are the main vector. This is a meaningful inaccuracy because geographic risk is one of the asked-for drivers of prophylaxis.",
    "completeness": "Includes: exposure history, >72h attachment estimate, prior bullseye rash/antibiotics. Missing key Gold Answer elements: the specific geographic rationale (Strathroy along the creek + Ontario map + assessed as concerning), the patient’s comment that Lyme risk is being considered for \"all ticks in this area,\" and the clinician’s plan to send the tick for lab identification and the \"safer than not\" framing. Overall it captures some but not all of the converging factors.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (hiking/gardening, >72h, prior target rash). But it introduces \"knowledge graph\" (not in transcript) and provides an unsupported/incorrect account of the geographic risk assessment (substituting general deer-tick-vector info for the map/Strathroy-based risk). These reduce grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested combination of factors (exposure, duration, geography, prior history) and links them to the prophylaxis decision, with minimal tangential content. The main issue is not relevance but the incorrect/omitted geographic details."
