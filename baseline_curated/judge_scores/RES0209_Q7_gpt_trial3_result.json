  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states the diagnosis at age 8 and describes the current exacerbation symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheeze, near-nonstop cough) consistent with the transcript. However, it fails to correctly describe the key bronchodilator-frequency change: it does not report the baseline “once every two weeks” or the current “almost everyday… five six times a week.” It also incorrectly implies nighttime symptoms reflect “near-daily use” and mischaracterizes nighttime symptoms as part of a baseline comparison; in the transcript, nighttime symptoms are described during the current 2-week worsening, not as a baseline feature. It also omits other key exacerbation features (chest tightness) and the point that wheezing occurs more often than bronchodilator use (only used when very bad).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) diagnosed at age 8; (2) current exacerbation symptoms include dry cough, SOB, wheeze, near-nonstop cough; (3) mentions triggers (cold air/pollen).\nKey points missed: (1) patient is now 10 (2-year history); (2) baseline bronchodilator use “maybe once every two weeks”; (3) current bronchodilator escalation explicitly “five six times a week”; (4) exacerbation duration clarified as last two weeks (and initial ‘week or so’); (5) chest tightness; (6) wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use (uses only when very hard to breathe); (7) nighttime symptoms emerged/frequency; (8) no infectious precipitant identified after screening.",
    "faithfulness": "Most symptom statements are grounded in cited transcript lines. However, the answer introduces an unsupported inference that nighttime symptoms indicate “near-daily use,” and it implies a baseline comparison about nighttime symptoms that is not supported (nighttime symptoms are only described in the current period). The mention of a “knowledge graph provided” is extraneous and not supported by the transcript context.",
    "relevance": "The response stays generally on the asked timeline (diagnosis → baseline → current exacerbation) and focuses on symptoms/bronchodilator use, but it under-delivers on the core of the question (explicit evolution of bronchodilator frequency over time) and adds minor irrelevant framing (“knowledge graph”)."
