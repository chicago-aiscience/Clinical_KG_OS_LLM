  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the hiking trip two weeks ago and the brushing of shoulders with strangers as the specific exposure event. It accurately lists the patient's symptoms (loss of smell/taste, dry cough) as matching the doctor's assessment. However, it fails to explain the logic of the 'connection' as presented in the Gold Answer, which relies on the exclusion of other possibilities due to the patient's isolated lifestyle.",
    "completeness": "The answer is missing significant context and details provided in the Gold Answer. It omits the patient's specific reasoning that they 'don't see where else' they could have been exposed, the lack of contact with sick individuals, the household composition, and the vaccination status. It also fails to mention the online schooling context mentioned in the prompt as the reason why the hike was a unique event.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph Link' and uses structured data tags (e.g., [MEDICAL_HISTORY]) that are not present in the source transcript or the Gold Answer. This represents a structural hallucination of an external knowledge source.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant as it directly identifies the exposure event and attempts to explain the connection to the COVID-19 diagnosis as requested."
