  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly asserts that the doctor's plan and self-care measures are not present in the transcript. These are explicitly stated in [D-43] (plan to consult a supervisor), [P-14] (Tylenol), [P-13] (expectoration), and [P-10] (resting). It also claims no alleviating factors were identified, which contradicts the gold answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer only successfully identifies the aggravating factors (exertion, coughing, deep breathing). It fails to cover the doctor's plan, the specific self-care measures tried, their effects, and the alleviating factors, which comprise about 75% of the requested information.",
    "faithfulness": "While the aggravating factors are correctly cited, the generated answer's claim that other information is 'missing' is a failure of faithfulness to the provided source text, as those details are clearly present in the latter half of the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address all parts of the question but fails to provide the relevant information for most of them, opting instead for a 'not found' response despite the information being available."
