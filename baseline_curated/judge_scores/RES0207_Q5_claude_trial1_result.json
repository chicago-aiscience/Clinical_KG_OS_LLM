  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two key risk factors (medication non-adherence and hereditary predisposition) and accurately cites the relevant exchanges. It correctly names Keppra as the medication [P-23], accurately quotes the patient's acknowledgment of forgetting medication [P-9], and correctly cites the family history with the mother having epilepsy [P-26]. All facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points: medication-related risk (missed Keppra dose, disruption due to daughter's birthday), hereditary risk (mother had epilepsy), and the relationship between family history and diagnosis. However, it lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific circumstance of the birthday celebration disrupting the dinner-time routine [P-24], the patient's acknowledgment that seizures are normally infrequent [P-9], and the implication that medication adherence normally provides good control. These omissions reduce completeness slightly.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations [P-9], [P-23], and [P-26] are accurate and appropriate. The answer does not introduce any hallucinated information. The references to 'knowledge graph' appear to be from the system's reasoning process rather than fabricated content, and don't contradict the transcript information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: hereditary risk factors (family history), medication-related risk factors (missed Keppra), and how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. The structure follows the question's organization logically with clear sections. No irrelevant content is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-structured response that correctly identifies both hereditary and medication-related risk factors with appropriate citations. It maintains high faithfulness to the source transcript and directly addresses all aspects of the question. The minor reduction in completeness score reflects the absence of some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific birthday celebration circumstances and the patient's normal seizure frequency, which provide fuller clinical context but are not essential to answering the core question."
