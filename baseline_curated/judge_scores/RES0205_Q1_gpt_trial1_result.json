  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately states the core persisting symptom (two-week cough now dry) and that there was earlier mucus which resolved, and it correctly notes chest soreness associated with coughing. It also reasonably reflects the patient’s description of initial “flu symptoms” resolving within several days. No clear contradictions with the Gold Answer are present, though it lacks several specific details (which impacts completeness more than correctness).",
    "completeness": "Included: persistent 2-week cough; dry cough at consult; earlier mucus that resolved; chest soreness with coughing; general statement that early “flu-like symptoms” resolved.\nMissing key Gold Answer items: explicit sore throat (first 2–3 days) and runny nose (first couple days); timing/detail of productive cough with “whitish clear” mucus for first 4–5 days; cough frequency (~3–4 times/hour); spontaneous/no triggers; stable intensity and frequency; pertinent negatives (no dyspnea, no fever, no N/V, no abdominal pain). Overall coverage is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s key symptom details.",
    "faithfulness": "All included symptom claims are supported by the transcript citations provided (cough duration/dry nature; early mucus; early flu-like symptoms resolving; chest soreness with excessive cough). The added ‘background conditions’ (anxiety, acid reflux) are also in the transcript, though they are not symptoms of the two-week illness and are not asked for. No major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer mainly addresses symptoms during the two-week illness (resolved vs ongoing), but it omits many of the ‘specific’ symptom details requested (frequency, triggers, stability, negatives) and introduces background conditions (acid reflux, anxiety) that are not part of the question, reducing focus."
