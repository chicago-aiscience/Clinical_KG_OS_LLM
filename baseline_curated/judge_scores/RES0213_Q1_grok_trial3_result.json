  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer: sharp, strong pain on deep breath [P-3], 20-minute episode duration [P-6], occurrence during solitary activities like walking alone or studying [P-4, P-29], and resolution when engaged socially or in manual tasks [P-9, P-29]. Minor discrepancies include omitting the initial description as 'uncomfortable/odd' rather than pain [P-2], the overall 1.5-week history [P-2/D-3], pain at rest [D-11], no worsening with exercise [P-10], no injury [P-5], and first-time occurrence [P-17]; it also slightly over-interprets attribution to nervousness [P-19] as causing the pain quality, whereas the patient suspects stress but describes pain separately.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: quality (sharp/strong on deep breath), duration of episodes (20 minutes), situations of occurrence (walking alone, studying), situations of resolution (social interaction, manual tasks). Key points missed: total duration (1.5 weeks), initial quality nuance ('uncomfortable/odd'), intermittent throughout day, occurs at rest, not worse with exercise/walking same, no preceding injury, no prior episodes. Covers ~80% of Gold Answer, focusing well on question-specified aspects.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: sharp pain on deep breath [P-3], 20 min [P-6], stress worry [P-8], solitary triggers [P-29], social/manual resolution [P-29], nervousness/SOB [P-19], anxiety context [P-20]. Minor interpretive stretch in directly attributing pain quality to nervousness, but patient links symptoms to anxiety plausibly; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around quality, duration of episodes, and situations of occurrence versus resolution, with no off-topic content."
