  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the source transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the symptoms, the husband's illness, and the lack of a flu shot.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers two of the three specific epidemiological factors mentioned in the prompt (husband's illness and lack of flu shot). However, it fails to explicitly address the 'shared household with limited outside contact' (working from home, only a hiking trip) which the Gold Answer uses to explain why household transmission is more likely than independent exposures.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. It mentions a 'Knowledge Graph' which is an external logical construct but does not detract from the faithfulness to the clinical narrative.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question of how these factors shape the differential diagnosis, providing a clear prioritization of COVID-19 over influenza."
