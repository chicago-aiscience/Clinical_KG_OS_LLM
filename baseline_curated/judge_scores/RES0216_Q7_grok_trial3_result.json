  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the onset as three days ago [P-1], first notice during walking (implied with dog [P-1,P-4]), description of tightness on inspiration without pain [P-1,P-5], and exacerbation with walking [P-9,P-10]; however, it inaccurately describes the symptoms as 'evolved into a significant respiratory issue' contradicting the Gold and transcript's report of symptoms staying 'the same' and 'pretty steady' [P-2,P-3], omits no specific trigger [P-3], misses other exacerbators like getting up from chair or big breaths [P-9], and does not specify the reduction in walks from two to one per day [P-22]; adds breathlessness and hoarseness/phlegm which are factual but not central to tightness evolution per Gold. Some factual errors but main points (onset, trigger, impact) mostly align.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: onset three days [P-1], first noticed on walk with dog (partial [P-4]), exacerbated by walking [P-9,P-10], noticeable on inspiration [P-1,P-5], affects walking routine somewhat [P-22]; missed: no particular trigger [P-3], staying the same/steady [P-2,P-3], always there at baseline but worse with specific activities like chair/getting up/big breath [P-9,P-10], precise impact of reducing from couple walks to one daily [P-22], no missed work [P-21,P-22], noticeably limiting activity [P-22,P-23]. Covers ~40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1] for onset/trigger, [P-7] breathlessness, [P-11] hoarse/phlegm); minor unverifiable interpretive phrasing like 'evolved into a significant respiratory issue' (symptoms steady per [P-2,P-3]) and linking doctor's future plan [D-35] to trigger, but no outright hallucinations; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around onset, trigger, evolution, and impact on walking routine per question; minor tangents include asthma history difference [P-16] and associated symptoms like hoarseness [P-11], but overall focused on chest tightness development."
