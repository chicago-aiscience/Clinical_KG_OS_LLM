  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine as an occasional OTC antihistamine for seasonal allergies with accurate citations [P-35, P-36], and confirms no prescribed medications [P-36], consistent with Gold. Minor discrepancy: attributes statements to 'the patient' instead of the mother/parent (P), and omits explicit no-treatment for current episodes and past infections, but core facts match without errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) no meds/treatment for current respiratory episodes [P-33,34]; (2) occasional OTC Reactine for untested seasonal allergies [P-35,36]; (3) no prescribed medications [P-36,46,47]; (4) past viral infections required no antibiotics [P-16]. Generated covers (2) and (3) fully, partially implies (1) but does not state explicitly; misses (4). Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about Reactine, seasonal allergies, and no prescribed meds are directly verifiable in cited transcript sections [P-35,36]; minor inaccuracy in saying 'patient mentions/states' (actually mother/parent P), but plausible in clinical context and not hallucinatory; no fabricated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications for other conditions (allergies) and prescribed status; partially addresses current episodes by implication via 'only medication identified,' but lacks explicit statement on no treatment for respiratory issues; no off-topic content."
