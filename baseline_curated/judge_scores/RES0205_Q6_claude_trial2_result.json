  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the physical examination components (heart and lung auscultation, quick physical exam) and the collaborative process (consulting with supervising physician, reviewing discussion, returning to discuss next steps). The citations to [D-37] are accurate and match the Gold Answer's references.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the essential elements but lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) the connection to the initial plan stated in [D-1], (2) the patient's agreement [P-37], (3) the observation that no diagnosis or treatment was provided at this stage, and (4) the note that this pattern is consistent with a learner/trainee model. However, it captures all the primary components of the plan and process (approximately 70-75% of key points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-37]. The quotes are accurate ('quick listen to your heart and lungs', 'quick physical exam', 'go get the doctor that I'm working with and go over everything you talked about', 'where to go from here'). No hallucinated content is present. Citations are correct and the paraphrasing is faithful to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: (1) the doctor's stated plan at the end, (2) specified physical examination components, and (3) the process described for determining next steps. The response is focused and contains no irrelevant information. The bullet-point format efficiently organizes the answer to match the multi-part question structure."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a highly accurate and relevant response that directly addresses all parts of the question with correct facts and proper citations. It successfully identifies the physical examination components and collaborative process described by the doctor. While it lacks some contextual enrichment present in the Gold Answer (such as the connection to the opening statement, patient agreement, and educational context), it captures all essential information needed to answer the question. The response is fully grounded in the transcript with no hallucinations and maintains perfect relevance throughout."
