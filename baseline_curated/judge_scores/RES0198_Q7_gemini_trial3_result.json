  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer captures the general timeline but fails on a key factual clarification present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it states the symptoms were 'on and off' based on the patient's first statement [P-1], but it ignores the patient's later clarification in [P-8] that the symptoms have actually been 'pretty constant' when asked directly by the doctor. It also infers that the stuffy nose was the initial symptom based on medication use [P-10] rather than citing the patient's direct confirmation in [P-3].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) The specific quote from [P-3] where the patient directly answers what started first. 2) The crucial clarification in [P-8] regarding the constancy of symptoms. 3) The mention that symptoms had not improved, which prompted the visit.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims are generally grounded in the transcript (using P-1 and P-10), but the reasoning for the 'Initial Symptom' is somewhat circuitous, relying on an inference about decongestants rather than the direct statement provided by the patient earlier in the dialogue [P-3]. It overlooks the most definitive statements in favor of earlier, less precise ones.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the user's prompt (onset, order, shift, and frequency), even if the content is less complete than the Gold Answer."
