  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the mother's suspicion of school as the source [P-2, P-1], no known sick contacts outside school [P-38], and uncertainty about school contacts ('hard to say' [P-38]). It correctly notes lack of specific notification details but slightly misattributes by saying 'does not cite' while [P-39] explicitly states no contact from school; adds unrelated 'knowledge graph' not in transcript. Core facts match Gold, minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: school central to suspicion [P-2/P-1], no sick contacts outside [P-38], hard to say at school [P-38], implies no school notification. Misses explicit [P-39] school no-contact, school test requirement [P-41], no travel/environmental [D-40/P-40, D-37/P-37]. Covers ~80% of Gold's key points focused on question.",
    "faithfulness": "All main claims verifiable: school suspicion [P-2], timeline [P-1], contacts [P-38]; notification inference close to [P-39] but rephrased inaccurately; 'knowledge graph' hallucinated (not in transcript); [D-44] misused for notification. Minor unverifiable details, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around suspected source from school attendance, sick contacts at/ outside school, and lack of notification, perfectly matching question with no tangents."
