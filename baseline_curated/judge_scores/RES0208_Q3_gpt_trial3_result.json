  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer: general infectious process evidence = fevers + fatigue + muscle aches (D-36). COVID cannot be ruled out because of difficulty breathing plus emerging sore throat and cough (D-36). Generated Answer correctly names fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches, but incorrectly also groups difficulty breathing, sore throat, and cough under “general infectious process” rather than identifying them as the additional features driving COVID concern. It further claims loss of taste/smell were the “distinct symptoms” leading to COVID concern; while the patient reported these, the doctor did not cite them in the D-36 assessment as the reason COVID couldn’t be ruled out. The reference to a “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript. Overall, key distinctions are wrong.",
    "completeness": "Covers: fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (general infection) — correct. Misses/misframes: that the doctor’s explicit COVID-not-ruled-out rationale was difficulty breathing + (developing) sore throat and cough; instead it substitutes loss of taste/smell and misclassifies the respiratory symptoms as part of the general infection bucket. Also omits the Gold’s explicit note that taste/smell were not mentioned by the doctor in the assessment summary.",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated reliance on an unspecified “knowledge graph,” and the claim that loss of taste/smell were the symptoms that led the doctor to say COVID couldn’t be ruled out. The doctor did not explicitly cite anosmia/ageusia in D-36. While difficulty breathing/sore throat/cough are in D-36, the Generated Answer’s categorization and causal attribution are not faithful to the doctor’s stated reasoning.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to directly answer which symptoms supported a general infection and which supported inability to rule out COVID. It stays on-topic, though it adds irrelevant/unjustified “knowledge graph” framing."
