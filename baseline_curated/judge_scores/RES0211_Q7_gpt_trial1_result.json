  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the overall illness duration (3–4 days) and that throat/cough symptoms and feeling hot were part of the same episode, with the clinician later summarizing “a little bit of fever.” However, it misstates the initial symptom order: the transcript is explicit that the *scratchy throat came first, then the cough* [P-4], whereas the Generated Answer groups “dry cough and scratchy throat” together as the first symptom(s) and implies cough as equally initial. It also over-interprets timing by saying feeling hot occurred “followed immediately” or “alongside” the throat/cough timeline; the Gold Answer correctly notes the transcript does *not* specify exactly when the hot sensation began relative to throat/cough onset. These are meaningful timeline inaccuracies for a question focused on symptom progression.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements partially covered: (1) duration covered; (2) throat → cough progression only partially captured (not clearly ordered); (3) ‘feeling hot’ described but without the Gold’s important nuance that onset relative to throat/cough is unspecified; (4) missing several symptom progressions emphasized in Gold: malaise/feeling crappy overall [P-1, P-14], fatigue [P-13], and the framing of progression from localized upper-airway symptoms to broader systemic symptoms. The headache is mentioned but not clearly placed as “by the time of the visit” or that it was milder at the visit [P-2]. Overall, it captures some but not most of the key progression details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are traceable to the transcript (3–4 days, scratchy throat/cough, headache mention, feeling hot, clinician summary of fever). However, the claim that feeling hot occurred “followed immediately” after noting cough/throat and that it was “concurrent” in a specific way is not supported by the transcript; the transcript only establishes it occurred during the same multi-day illness without specifying relative onset. This is an inference beyond what is stated.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on symptom order/progression and the relationship of feeling hot to cough/throat timing, which directly addresses the question. Minor extra mention (post-nasal drip) is not central but does not derail the answer."
