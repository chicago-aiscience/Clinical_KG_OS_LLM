  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab order [D-53] and self-isolation for patient and husband [D-53, D-54], matching Gold. It accurately notes further workup and ruling out COVID before considering influenza [D-53, D-54]. However, it omits the specific next steps of proceeding to a physical exam [D-52] and consulting the supervising doctor before returning [D-55]. No contradictions, but minor discrepancies in fully capturing the plan's details.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) COVID swab (covered); 2) self-isolation for patient/husband (covered); 3) physical exam next (missed); 4) consult supervising doctor and return (missed); 5) patient agreement (missed). Covers the test and precautionary measures fully (~50%), partial on next steps with 'further workup', but misses specifics; 50-79% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like swab, isolation, further workup, flu possibility are directly verifiable [D-52-55]. Citations accurate. Minor unverifiable additions: 'clinical guidelines provided' (not in transcript), rationales like 'sick contact likely indicator' (plausible inference from [P-19, D-53] but not verbatim). Mostly grounded, no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around diagnostic testing (test ordered), precautionary measures (isolation), and next steps, perfectly matching question's focus on management plan, test, precautions for patient/husband, and next steps; no off-topic content."
