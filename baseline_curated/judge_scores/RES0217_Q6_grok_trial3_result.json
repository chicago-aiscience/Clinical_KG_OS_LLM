  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is mostly factually accurate compared to the Gold Answer, correctly identifying the three diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick to lab, blood work for serology), prophylactic antibiotics with reasons (72-hour attachment), physician consultation, and preventive advice on ticks' habitat and insecticide. However, it introduces a significant factual error by including 'continue taking statin for cholesterol' as part of the treatment plan, which is not mentioned in the Gold Answer or as part of the doctor's plan in the transcript (it was only patient history noted in D-14/D-15). It also omits explicit mention of geographic risk from Strathroy and the tick's 'waving motion,' but these are minor omissions rather than contradictions. Core facts are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: all three diagnostic tests (100%); prophylactic antibiotics recommendation, rationale (>72 hours [D-6], geographic risk implied but not explicitly Strathroy [D-13]), no specifics on antibiotic (covered); physician consultation (covered); preventive advice on habitat (covered), insecticide for garden (covered). Missed: explicit 'waving motion with their legs' description and precise phrasing of quotes like 'probably safer than not.' Extra cholesterol advice not in Gold. Covers approximately 85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are verifiable: tick ID [D-6,D-18], blood work [D-18], physical exam [D-18], antibiotics [D-6,D-13,D-18], physician talk [D-18,D-22], preventive [D-18]. Citations accurate. Hallucinations: cholesterol continuation as 'treatment' (only history in [D-14,D-15], not planned treatment); 'assess other potential exposures' during physical exam (exposures already verbally checked earlier, physical is for bite site); 'finalize... and proceed with starting antibiotics [D-18]' slightly stretches as antibiotics discussed earlier. 'Knowledge graph' mention not in transcript but minor. Some unverifiable/plausible additions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured and focused on the question's categories (diagnostic tests lab/physical, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice on garden/outdoor), directly addressing the comprehensive plan with no major off-topic content; minor cholesterol addition is a small tangent."
