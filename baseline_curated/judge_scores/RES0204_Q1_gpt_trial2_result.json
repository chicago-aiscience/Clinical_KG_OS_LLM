  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and roughly captures timing (cough ~4–5 days; runny nose past couple of days). However, it contains major inaccuracies by stating the transcript does not specify whether the cough is productive vs. non-productive and does not describe the nasal discharge appearance. In the transcript, the cough is explicitly described as dry and non-productive (no “gunk”/sputum), and the nasal discharge is described as “pretty clear.” These errors directly contradict the source and the Gold Answer, making the response substantially incorrect despite a few correct elements.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) cough present ~4–5 days; (2) runny nose for past couple of days. Key points missed: (1) cough is dry; (2) cough is explicitly non-productive; (3) cough has stayed the same (not worsening/improving); (4) nasal discharge is clear; (5) patient’s comment about never having a dry cough like this and prior runny noses not lasting as long; (6) pertinent negatives (e.g., sore throat, chest pain, no wheeze/SOB). Overall, it captures less than half of the required symptom characteristics.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are based on the transcript (e.g., symptom presence and duration), but the answer repeatedly claims the transcript lacks information that is actually explicitly stated (productive vs non-productive cough; appearance of nasal discharge). This is a form of unfaithfulness to the source. It also references a “knowledge graph provided,” which is not part of the transcript content given.",
    "relevance": "The answer is on-topic (respiratory symptoms and characteristics) but fails to provide the specific characteristics requested (productive vs. non-productive cough and nasal discharge appearance), which are central to the question. Thus it is only partially responsive."
