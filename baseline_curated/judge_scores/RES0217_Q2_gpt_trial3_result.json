  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the patient takes a statin for cholesterol but cannot recall which one (matches [P-14–P-15]). It also correctly reports the clinician’s recommendation to start prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72 hours attachment and repeated statements about moving forward with antibiotics/“safer than not” (matches [D-6], [D-13], [D-18]). It appropriately notes that no specific antibiotic name/dose/duration was given. The only minor issue is the repeated reference to a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript; however, it does not introduce incorrect medication facts.",
    "completeness": "Key items from the Gold Answer that are missing: (1) patient denial of allergies/no drug allergies ([P-16–P-17]); (2) past history of a prior tick bite with bullseye rash and needing antibiotics “for a bit” (~10 years ago) ([P-3]); (3) planned non-medication management steps discussed: sending the tick to the lab for species identification and ordering bloodwork/serology ([D-6], [D-18]); (4) environmental prevention advice (consider insecticide) ([D-18]); and (5) plan to consult the supervising physician before finalizing ([D-13], [D-22]). It covers the two core medication points (statin + prophylactic antibiotics) but not the other discussed treatments/plans.",
    "faithfulness": "Most clinical claims are grounded in the transcript (statin use; prophylactic antibiotics rationale; no specific antibiotic details). However, the answer introduces and relies on an external “knowledge graph” and asserts it ‘confirms’ relationships; this content is not verifiable from the provided transcript. No clear hallucinated medications are added, but the knowledge-graph framing is unsupported.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments discussed, specifically the current statin and proposed prophylactic antibiotics, which directly answers the question. Minor irrelevant content includes repeated mention of a “knowledge graph,” but it does not substantially derail the answer."
