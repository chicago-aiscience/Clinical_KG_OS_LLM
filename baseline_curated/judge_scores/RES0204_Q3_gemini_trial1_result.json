  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with both the Source Transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the duration of the cough (4-5 days), the clinical reasoning for the chest X-ray (persistent nature and needing a better look), and the reasoning for the COVID swab (institutional protocol for similar symptoms).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer and the prompt itself. Specifically, it fails to mention the 'clear nasal discharge' (a present symptom explicitly mentioned in the prompt) and several pertinent negatives requested in the prompt: 'sore throat' and 'muscle aches.' It also omits the details regarding 'travel history' and 'sick contacts' included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are well-supported by the transcript. The use of direct quotes and correct turn markers (e.g., [P-2], [D-37], [D-39]) demonstrates high faithfulness to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the question of why the specific diagnostic tests were ordered based on the patient's presentation, although it omitted a few specific symptoms listed in the question."
