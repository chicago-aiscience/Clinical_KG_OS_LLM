  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline elements from the Gold Answer: 3-month onset [P-2], 1-month sleep disruption [P-19], 3-day productive greenish sputum [P-2, P-9, P-12], and couple-day subjective fevers [P-4]. Minor discrepancies include omitting the dry/intermittent nature initially [P-2], specific 'little coughy' onset during pole dancing [P-13], 'every night' sleep detail [P-21], fatigue [P-19], and acute-on-chronic summary; doctor's summary [D-47] is referenced but not fully echoed.",
    "completeness": "Covers key timeline points: 3mo onset, 1mo sleep disruption, 3d productive sputum, couple d fevers (80-99% of Gold's main points). Misses: pole class onset [P-13], dry/intermittent for 2mo [P-2], 'pretty well every night' [P-21], fatigue [P-19], acute-on-chronic conclusion.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: timelines from [P-2, P-19, P-9, P-4, D-47]. Hallucinations include repeated references to non-existent 'knowledge graph' and its indication of 'respiratory infection', which are not in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures timeline directly addressing onset, sleep disruption, productive sputum, and fevers as specified in question; no off-topic content."
