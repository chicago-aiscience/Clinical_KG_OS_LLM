  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core symptoms (dry cough, fever, loss of taste) and the doctor's diagnostic logic (using fever to differentiate infection from asthma). It accurately quotes the temperature (101°F) and the timeline of the cough. However, it introduces an external 'knowledge graph' and specific labels like [LAB_RESULT] and [SYMPTOM] which are not part of the gold answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all key points from the gold answer, including the triad of symptoms, the specific alignment with COVID-19 mentioned in D-44, and the clinician's use of fever to confirm an infectious process over asthma as explained in D-45.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information and uses structural tags ([KG], [LAB_RESULT]) that do not exist in the source transcript. While the clinical facts themselves are grounded in the text, the attribution to an external knowledge system is a hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant, directly answering both parts of the question regarding the combination of symptoms and the collective use of findings to conclude an infectious process."
