  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the pain quality (sharp/strong, occurs on deep breath) and episode duration (20 minutes). However, it contains a factual error by claiming the pain 'does not happen... outside of episodes involving an anxiety attack.' Per the transcript [P-20 to P-22], the patient associates anxiety attacks with heart fluttering and notes they haven't had one in eight years, whereas the chest pain is a recent development (last 1.5 weeks) occurring during daily activities like walking and studying.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the specific elements requested in the prompt (quality, duration, and triggers). However, compared to the Gold Answer, it misses several descriptive characteristics: the 1.5-week total duration, the initial description of the sensation as 'odd' or 'uncomfortable', the intermittent frequency, the fact that it occurs at rest, the lack of worsening with exercise, and the absence of preceding injury.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is generally grounded in the transcript with clear citations. The main breach of faithfulness is the misattribution of the 'anxiety attack' context from [P-20] (which discussed heart fluttering) to the occurrence of chest pain, which the transcript treats as a separate symptom experienced while walking or studying.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the prompt exactly, addressing quality, duration, and situations of occurrence versus resolution without including extraneous information."
