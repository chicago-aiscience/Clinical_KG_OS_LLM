  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer significantly misidentifies the screening for infectious causes: it lists chest tightness (D-20, an asthma symptom confirmation) and other health problems (D-29, general history) as infectious screening, which contradicts the Gold Answer's specific list (colds/infections D-21, loss of taste/smell D-25, fevers D-26, nausea/vomiting D-27, belly pain D-28, sick contacts D-22/23, travel D-24). It treats presenting symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheezing) as screening responses and lists asthma triggers (pollen, cold air) as exposure history, not infectious exposures. Only the COVID swab plan matches, but core facts are wrong or inverted.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: symptoms screened (colds/infections, anosmia, fever, GI symptoms, dry cough confirmation) - 0% covered; exposures (sick contacts home/frequent/outside, travel) - 0% covered; all denied with citations - 0%; explanation D-29 - not covered; planned COVID swab despite negatives - covered. Covers ~10-20% (only swab), misses nearly all screening details and responses.",
    "faithfulness": "Chest tightness (D-20) and other health problems (D-29) verifiable but wrongly attributed as infectious screening (hallucinated purpose); patient symptoms (P-1, P-15) verifiable but misclassified as screening responses; pollen/cold triggers (P-9/11) verifiable but irrelevant to infectious screening; COVID swab (D-29) accurate. Multiple hallucinations on what constitutes infectious screening; not grounded in transcript's explicit infection questions (D-21 to D-28).",
    "relevance": "Attempts structure matching question (screening symptoms/exposures, responses, planned test) but populates with irrelevant asthma symptoms/triggers instead of infectious screening; partially addresses planned test but largely off-topic with misinterpretations."
