  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all three key management components from the Gold Answer: COVID-19 swab test with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation period, and separation from the younger sister. The facts are accurately presented and consistent with the source material [D-44].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the core management recommendations but omits several important details present in the Gold Answer: (1) emergency room precautions for high fever, neurological symptoms, weakness, dizziness, or fainting, (2) possibility of false-negative results, (3) alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative, (4) no medication prescribed/supportive care approach, (5) school requirement for COVID test, and (6) household composition details. It covers approximately 60% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
