  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core facts: the missed dose of Keppra as the medication-related risk factor and the maternal history of epilepsy as the hereditary risk factor. It accurately links these to the seizure episode and the patient's diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers most key points but misses a few details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific reason for the missed dose (the daughter's birthday celebration) and the patient's statement that seizures are usually infrequent, indicating the condition is normally well-controlled.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer correctly cites the transcript sections [P-9, P-23, P-26]. However, it references an external 'knowledge graph' multiple times, which is not part of the provided transcript or Gold Answer, representing an external hallucination of the source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question: the specific risk factors and the relationship between family history and the diagnosis."
