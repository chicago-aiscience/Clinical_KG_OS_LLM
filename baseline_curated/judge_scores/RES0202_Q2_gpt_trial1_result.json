  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the COVID-19 swab test, the expected turnaround time (24–48 hours), the recommendation to isolate for 14 days, and the specific instruction to isolate from the younger sister—all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [D-44]. No incorrect statements are introduced.",
    "completeness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, it includes the diagnostic test + timing, isolation duration, and the specific household member to isolate from. However, it omits several management measures present in the Gold Answer/transcript: (1) warning/return-to-care instructions to go to the ER for high temperature, neurologic symptoms (seizures), weakness/dizziness, or fainting [D-44]; (2) discussion of possible false negatives [D-44]; (3) possibility of another circulating viral illness if negative [D-44]; (4) supportive/observational approach/no medications and plan to wait for results [D-44]; and (5) the school’s requirement for a COVID test to return [P-41]. Overall, this is substantially incomplete relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript and are correctly attributed to [D-44]. There are no added, unverifiable, or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question’s requested elements (test, isolation duration, and who to isolate from) without irrelevant content."
