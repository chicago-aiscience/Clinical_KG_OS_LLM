  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer regarding the primary symptoms (dry cough, fever, scratchy throat, headache) and the significance of the absent symptoms (sputum, GI issues, joint pain). It correctly identifies the 3-4 day timeline and the clinical implication of a non-productive cough (distinguishing upper from lower respiratory issues).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few elements present in the gold answer: it does not mention 'malaise' or 'fatigue' as contributing symptoms, and it omits the crucial epidemiological evidence of the brother's recent cold, which the gold answer uses to support the assessment of household viral exposure.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer correctly cites the transcript for Jessica's symptoms. however, it hallucinates the existence of a 'provided knowledge graph' which was not part of the source material provided in the prompt. This structural framing is not grounded in the context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the specific symptoms and absences mentioned in the user's question to explain the URI assessment."
