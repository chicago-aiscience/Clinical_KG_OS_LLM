  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as anxiety-induced chest pain, which is consistent with the gold answer. The clinical observations provided (situational triggers, response to distraction, physical manifestations, history, and patient insight) are all factually accurate according to the transcript and the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points including situational patterns, physical signs (breathing), history of anxiety, current stressors, and patient perspective. However, it misses the 'pertinent negatives' section included in the gold answer (no fevers, no exertional worsening, no asthma, etc.), which is a critical component of clinical reasoning for excluding other pathologies.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. The citations provided (P-29, P-19, P-20, P-13, P-8) accurately reflect the patient's statements. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the diagnosis and the specific clinical observations that support it. It remains focused on the clinical reasoning required."
