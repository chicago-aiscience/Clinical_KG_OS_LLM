  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the patient’s medication for epilepsy (matches [P-23], [P-8]). It is also true that the patient missed a dose because they \"forgot\" ([P-9]). However, it does not provide the transcript-supported *specific circumstance* for why they forgot (daughter’s birthday / altered dinner routine), which is central to the question and Gold Answer (but this is more a completeness issue than an outright factual error).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: \n- Keppra prescribed for chronic epilepsy.\n- Patient missed a dose due to forgetting.\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed:\n- The concrete situation causing the missed dose: daughter’s birthday celebration, doing things differently, celebrating earlier, and not having dinner at the usual time which disrupted the normal dosing routine ([P-24]).\n- Context that it was a situational lapse rather than a persistent adherence problem (supported by [D-24], [P-24]).\n- Link made by patient that missed dose likely contributed to seizure (briefly present in Gold; partially implied but not stated).\n\nBecause the question explicitly asks for the *specific circumstance*, omission of the birthday/meal-timing detail is a major gap.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (Keppra; forgot a dose). However, the answer introduces \"knowledge graph\" support and statements like \"knowledge graph supports as a cause for seizures,\" which are not in the provided transcript and therefore are unverifiable additions. This is minor but still reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the two items asked: the prescribed medication and why a dose was missed. It does not add unrelated clinical details."
