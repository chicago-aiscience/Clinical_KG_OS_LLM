  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab and the isolation recommendation. It also correctly interprets the doctor's prioritization of ruling out COVID-19 before considering other possibilities like the flu.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two specific 'next steps' that are present in the Gold Answer and the source transcript: the immediate transition to a physical exam [D-52] and the clinician's plan to consult with the senior doctor before returning [D-55]. It covers the test and the isolation (50% of the key components).",
    "faithfulness": "All points in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript. Citations for the swab and isolation are correct. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question's components: management plan, specific test, precautionary measures, and next steps."
