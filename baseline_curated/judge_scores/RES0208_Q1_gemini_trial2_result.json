  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer has several factual issues. It misinterprets the patient's description of a starting cough (it 'feels dry like it's on its way' [P-8]) as a 'dry throat sensation'. It also incorrectly categorizes 'Headaches' under 'Sensory Changes' while completely omitting the actual sensory changes reported (loss of taste [P-4] and smell [P-6]).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key clinical findings listed in the Gold Answer: loss of taste, loss of smell, subjective fever (wife feeling forehead), and the presence of a mild sore throat. It only covers about half of the reported symptoms beyond the chief complaints.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, but the interpretation of P-8 as a 'dry throat' is a misrepresentation of the patient's discussion about a dry cough. Most other claims align with transcript quotes.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompt's requested categories (sensory, respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional), although the content within those categories is incomplete and occasionally misplaced."
