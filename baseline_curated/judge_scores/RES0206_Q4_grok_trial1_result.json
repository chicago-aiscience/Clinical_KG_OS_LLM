  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the COVID swab as the test, and correctly cites [D-43] for both. The detail about social contacts matches the transcript and Gold Answer's core description from [P-20], with accurate paraphrasing and quoting of key phrases like 'too safe' and 'a little too close'. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: condition (COVID-19), test (COVID swab), core prompting detail (social contacts with sick friend during dog walks, too close despite outdoors). Missed: patient's uncertainty about friend's COVID test [P-21], doctor's screening for COVID symptoms (smell/taste [P-32/P-33], confusion [P-34], muscle aches [P-35]), travel question [P-31], and explanatory rationale despite absent symptoms. Covers core ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: COVID-19 and swab in [D-43], social contacts details in [P-20]. Citations accurate, phrasing faithful to patient's words, no unverifiable or hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "Directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question (condition, test, prompting social detail) with no off-topic content or tangents."
