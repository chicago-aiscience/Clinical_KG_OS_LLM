  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness at the site behind left knee, distinguishing skin from joint) consistent with Gold and transcript [P-1, P-6], but has significant factual errors in systemic symptoms: misinterprets P-1 local description as denial of joint pain (actual denial at P-7); wrongly attributes headaches denial to P-6 with incorrect quote (actual at P-19); falsely claims no explicit fever denial despite P-8 'No, no, I've been fine' to D-8 screening. Misses Gold's emphasis on no bullseye rash denial as key local negative. Overall, significant contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers Gold's local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness, location, skin not joint [P-1, P-6]) but misses 'stuck pretty good', explicit denial of bullseye/target rash [P-6], and statements of being 'totally fine' aside from local tenderness [P-18] and 'pretty healthy' [P-13]. For systemic, identifies all three screenings (fever D-8, joint pain D-7, headaches D-19) and denials but with inaccuracies; covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Local claims verifiable [P-1, P-6]. Systemic has multiple issues: joint pain denial wrongly tied to P-1 (screening P-7); headaches denial hallucinated quote/citation to P-6 (rash denial, actual P-19); fever denial incorrectly stated as absent despite P-8 explicit 'No, no, I've been fine'. Several unverifiable/misattributed claims indicate hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around local symptoms at tick bite site and systemic screenings/denials for fever, joint pain, headaches as per question; no extraneous content."
