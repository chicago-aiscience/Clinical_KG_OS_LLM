  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, discovery and presentation with tick in container) and comparison (prior bullseye rash and antibiotics with more engorged tick vs. current smaller tick, localized redness/tenderness without bullseye). Minor discrepancies include omitting the patient's uncertainty about attachment timing ('don't know when got it', hoping from hiking not garden [P-1]), the soreness specifically prompting discovery 'earlier today' [P-1], doctor's >72-hour estimate [D-6], and exact phrasing of no 'larger circle rash' [P-6]; however, these do not alter core facts.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: hiking Friday [P-1], gardening Saturday [P-1], discovery/presentation with container [P-1], prior ~10 years bullseye rash/antibiotics [P-3], prior tick 'quite swollen' vs current 'pretty small'/'little bit' engorged [P-3,P-4], current localized red/tender without bullseye [P-1,P-3]. Missed/partial: Strathroy location [P-12] (minor), uncertainty/hope from hiking [P-1], soreness-prompted discovery 'earlier today' [P-1], tick in knee crease [P-1], >72hrs estimate [D-6], doctor not 'grape'-engorged [D-4], explicit no 'larger circle rash' [P-6]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., activities [P-1], symptoms/location [P-1], prior history/comparison [P-3], tick size [D-5/P-4]); no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response into timeline (Friday-Saturday-discovery-presentation) and direct comparison of symptoms/engorgement to prior episode, with no off-topic content."
