  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely factually accurate to the Gold Answer, correctly identifying productive cough with yellow sputum and red spots (citing P-6 accurately), fever (P-5 correct, though P-14 is tangential as it mentions Tylenol relief without specifying fever), exertional dyspnea (P-10, P-11), and detailed pleuritic chest pain (P-17-P-19). Minor discrepancies include term 'hemoptytic sputum' (Gold uses 'blood-tinged'), incomplete fever/chills details (misses P-8/P-9 chills), omission of smoking risk factor, and addition of interpretive phrases like 'bacterial infection hallmark' not emphasized in Gold. Core facts align well.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: productive cough/yellow sputum/red spots (100%), fever (partial, misses chills timing), exertional dyspnea (full), pleuritic chest pain details/pleural support (full). Missed: precise fever/chills timeline [P-8,P-9], constant dull pain even at rest [P-20,P-21], smoking history as risk factor [P-37,P-38]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: sputum [P-4,P-6], fever [P-5], dyspnea [P-10,P-11], pain [P-17-P-19]. Minor issues: P-14 cited for fever (Tylenol helps symptoms generally, plausible). Hallucinations: 'Knowledge Graph' references (absent from transcript), 'hemoptytic sputum' (red spots, not frank hemoptysis), 'compromised lung function/consolidation' (inferred, not direct). Mostly grounded with some unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing transcript-specific findings for LRTI/pneumonia (cough, fever, dyspnea, pain) with citations and explaining pleuritic pain's diagnostic support (worsening with breath/cough, pleural inflammation). Minor tangent on knowledge graph, but core content perfectly focused."
