  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline events: seizure the night before (matching Gold's 'later that night'), feeling fine after and going to bed, missed Keppra dose as cause (P-9, P-23), sudden SOB and dry cough upon waking (P-1, P-4), temperature check that morning (P-5), and decision to seek care due to uncertainty (P-1). Minor discrepancies include not specifying the birthday celebration and dinner disruption as the reason for missing the dose (Gold cites P-24), placing seizure before the missed dose factor (slight order reversal vs. Gold's sequence), omitting the ~3-hour onset estimate (P-11), prior lack of SOB (P-3), and uncertainty about seizure relation (P-8). No major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: evening seizure (P-8), fine after/bed (P-8), missed med cause (P-9), morning SOB (P-1), dry cough (P-2/P-4), temp check 37.4°C (P-5/P-6), decision to seek care (P-1). Missed: daughter's birthday celebration disrupting dinner routine leading to missed dose (P-24), respiratory symptoms ~3 hours before consult (P-11), never experienced SOB before (P-3), contributing concern and uncertainty about seizure relation (P-8). Covers ~70% of Gold's detailed points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims are verifiable in transcript (e.g., seizure P-8, missed med P-9, Keppra P-23, SOB P-1, cough P-4, temp P-5). Patient's epilepsy confirmed (P-8/P-22) and inference of missed dose causing seizure plausible (P-9). However, references to 'knowledge graph' and specific KG relationships (e.g., [TREATMENT] Keppra for epilepsy, missed dose --> seizure) are not present in the provided transcript, introducing minor unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly reconstructs the requested timeline from evening before (seizure, missed dose) to morning of consultation (respiratory onset, temp check, decision to seek care), with structured bullet points perfectly focused on the question; minor KG additions do not detract."
