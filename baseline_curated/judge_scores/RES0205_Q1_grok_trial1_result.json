  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the persistent dry cough as the main ongoing symptom (matching Gold's [P-2, P-5, P-6, P-14]), resolved initial mucus/productive phase ([P-5, P-6]), flu-like symptoms early on ([P-14]), and chest soreness with coughing ([P-15, P-16]). Minor discrepancies include not specifying sore throat ([P-13]) or runny nose ([P-14]) separately (though grouped under flu-like), omitting cough details like frequency (3-4x/hour [P-9]), spontaneity/no triggers ([P-10]), and stable intensity/frequency ([P-7, P-8]), and pertinent negatives (no SOB [P-11], fever [P-12], N/V [P-19], abd pain [P-20]). Significant issue: includes chronic anxiety and acid reflux ([P-22, P-25]) as 'Reported Background Conditions,' which are not symptoms of the two-week illness per Gold or question focus. Core facts on acute symptoms are correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: persistent cough 2 weeks ([P-2]), resolved flu-like symptoms incl. sore throat ([P-13]), runny nose ([P-14]), whitish clear mucus first 4-5 days ([P-6]), resolved by 3-4 days except cough ([P-14]); persistent dry cough since ~day 4-5 ([P-5,P-6]), chest soreness w/ coughing ([P-15,P-16]). Partially covers these via broad 'flu-like' and 'mucus.' Missed: explicit sore throat/runny nose; cough frequency [P-9], triggers [P-10], stability [P-7,P-8]; pertinent negatives [P-11,12,19,20]. Covers ~80% of symptom details (main categories but lacks granularity). Extras like chronics not in Gold.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript: flu-like [P-14], mucus earlier/now dry [P-5,P-6], cough persistent/dry [P-2,P-5,P-14], chest soreness [P-15], anxiety/reflux [P-22,P-25]. Citations accurate (e.g., [P-14] for flu-like/cough persistence). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; background chronics are directly quoted.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response around resolved vs. present symptoms of the two-week illness, directly matching question. Minor tangent: 'Reported Background Conditions' section on chronic anxiety/reflux, not part of acute illness symptoms."
