  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reproduces the management elements in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function tests, ABG, COVID swab, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation measurement with supplemental O2 as needed, continuation of bronchodilators, and addition of steroids and antibiotics. It does not introduce any contradictory or incorrect items compared with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It covers the major COPD-exacerbation plan components from the Gold Answer (labs, imaging, O2 sat monitoring, O2 as needed, bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, COVID swab). It omits two items present in the Gold Answer: (1) the stated expected COVID result timeframe (24–48 hours) and (2) the additional note about ongoing blood pressure monitoring mentioned in [D-37].",
    "faithfulness": "All listed tests/interventions are directly supported by [D-52]. The mention that Ventolin and Spiriva are the patient’s current bronchodilators is supported earlier in the transcript ([P-11]) and does not conflict with [D-52]. No clear hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer is tightly focused on the requested categories (labs, imaging, monitoring, and therapies including steroids/antibiotics/O2/bronchodilators) and directly addresses the question."
