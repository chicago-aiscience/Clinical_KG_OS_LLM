  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the attachment duration reasoning based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening leading to >72 hours [P-1, D-6], consistent with Gold. However, it incorrectly states that Strathroy's position on the Lyme map is 'not present' in the transcript, directly contradicting Gold and transcript [D-13], where the doctor explicitly references the map and deems Strathroy concerning, justifying antibiotics. Significant contradictions on the geographic risk component.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered from Gold: hiking Friday, gardening Saturday [P-1]; doctor's >72h estimate [D-6]; prophylactic need. Missed: patient's uncertainty on attachment [P-1]; timing of discovery today [D-1]; doctor's note on time since outdoors [D-2]; Strathroy location [P-12]; map reference and assessment as concerning [D-13]; combination leading to treatment. Covers ~50% (first part well, second absent).",
    "faithfulness": "Duration claims verifiable [P-1, D-6]. But hallucinates map detail 'not present' despite [D-13]; wrongly attributes justification solely to duration and prior rash [P-3, D-6], ignoring map; multiple unverifiable/false claims about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses both parts of the question: explains duration contribution fully; responds to map usage (albeit erroneously denying it). Mostly focused, no major off-topic content."
