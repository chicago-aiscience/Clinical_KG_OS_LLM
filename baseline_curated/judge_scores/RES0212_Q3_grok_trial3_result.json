  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer specifies a precise diagnosis of acute lower respiratory tract infection (likely acute bronchitis with possible bacterial superinfection or early community-acquired pneumonia, superimposed on chronic cough), with detailed pathophysiological explanations for each feature and context from the transcript. The Generated Answer uses a vague 'respiratory infection' diagnosis, inaccurately attributes sputum color to [P-2] (color is only in [P-9]), invents a 'Knowledge Graph' for evidence, and misinterprets [D-47] as concluding a diagnosis (it only recaps symptoms). Core idea of infection is present but lacks specificity and has factual errors in citations and claims.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: specific diagnosis including chronic cough context; productive cough as acute transition atop 3-month history [P-2,P-12]; greenish sputum suggesting bacterial concern [P-9]; subjective fevers as systemic response [P-4]; [D-47] distinguishing from chronic issues via absent symptoms; no vitals/exam. Generated covers basic contributions of three features and [D-47] recap (~60% coverage) but misses diagnosis precision, chronic context, bacterial nuance, symptom distinctions, and lack of confirmatory tests.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly grounded (productive cough [P-2], sputum [P-9/D-47], fever [P-4]) but [P-2] wrongly cited for color; hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' twice as source for sputum/fever indicating infection (absent from transcript); fabricates [D-47] as implicitly diagnosing 'respiratory infection' (it recaps without diagnosing). Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly names diagnosis and explains each of the three features' contributions with transcript ties, staying focused on the question despite vagueness and errors; minor off-topic via invented KG."
