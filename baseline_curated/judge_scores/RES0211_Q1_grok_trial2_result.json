  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies dry cough, scratchy throat, and headache as reported symptoms from [P-1], matching Gold. However, it inaccurately attributes 'fever' directly to Jessica's report via doctor's summary [D-58], whereas Gold specifies her 'feeling really hot' [P-7, P-9]; adds 'post nasal drip' [P-18] as a current symptom, but this relates to allergies, not the 3-4 day illness. For denials, it wrongly claims no explicit denial of sputum (contradicts [P-5, P-6]), implies absence via dry cough but misses direct query responses, and states no information on nausea [P-11], vomiting, diarrhea [P-12], joint pain [P-13], rashes [P-10], directly contradicting Gold. Significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold reported symptoms: dry cough/scratchy throat (covered), headache (covered), feeling hot/feverish (partially/misstated as fever), malaise/crappy/icky (missed), tired (missed). Denied: sputum/phlegm (missed/misstated), rashes/skin changes (missed), nausea/vomiting (missed), diarrhea (missed), joint aches (missed), breathing difficulty (missed). Covers 2-3 of ~11 key points (~20-30%).",
    "faithfulness": "Verifiable: dry cough/scratchy/headache [P-1]. Fever from doctor's inference [D-58], not direct patient report of fever. Post nasal drip [P-18] is allergy-related, not hallucinated but miscontextualized as current symptom. Sputum denial exists [P-5,P-6,D-5,D-6] but claimed not explicit or tied to wrong [D-58]; nausea/joint/rashes denials exist [P-10-13] but claimed absent—multiple inaccuracies and ungrounded claims about denials.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported symptoms over 3-4 days and specific denied symptoms (sputum, nausea, joint pain, rashes), with bullet points matching question format; minor issues with accuracy but no off-topic content."
