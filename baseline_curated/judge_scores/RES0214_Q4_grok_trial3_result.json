  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53], matching the Gold Answer. It includes the key quote from [D-53] on prioritizing COVID due to the husband's symptoms [P-19], aligning with the Gold's emphasis on household transmission. However, it introduces symptoms (fever and sore throat [P-1]) as a primary reason for prioritization, whereas the Gold focuses more exclusively on epidemiological context; the doctor's statement in [D-53] links infectious rule-out to fever/sore throat generally but specifies COVID first due to the husband. This is a minor discrepancy in emphasis, but core facts are consistent. No major errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Test ordered: COVID-19 swab [D-53] - fully covered. (2) Household transmission (husband's prior symptoms [P-19]) and key quote [D-53] - fully covered. (3) Self-isolation instruction reflecting urgency [D-53] - missed. (4) Influenza as secondary possibility after COVID rule-out and no flu shot [P-53, D-54] - partially implied in prioritization but not detailed (no mention of flu shot or sequencing). Covers core test and main rationale (80-90%), misses supporting details on isolation and flu specifics.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are verifiable in transcript: test and quote [D-53]; symptoms fever/sore throat [P-1]; husband symptoms [P-19]; general protocol phrasing from [D-53] ('fever and sore throat... rule out anything infectious'). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or inaccurate citations. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured directly around the question's two parts (diagnostic test and rationale for prioritizing COVID over influenza), with bullet points focused on relevant evidence from transcript. No off-topic content or tangents; symptoms mentioned are pertinent to the doctor's statements."
