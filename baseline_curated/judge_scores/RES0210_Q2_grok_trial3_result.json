  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for high cholesterol based on [P-25, P-26], matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states no OTC medications were taken, missing Tylenol explicitly mentioned in [P-14] ('I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit'), which Gold Answer identifies as OTC for symptom relief with partial effectiveness. It also hallucinates 'knowledge graph data' not present in the transcript. These are significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: (1) Lipitor for cholesterol [covered]; (2) confirmed only prescribed med [missed]; (3) Tylenol OTC for symptoms, 'helps a little bit' [missed entirely]; (4) no other meds; non-med relief noted [missed]. Covers ~25% of key points (only Lipitor).",
    "faithfulness": "Lipitor claim verifiable in [P-25-P-27]. OTC absence claim unverifiable and false, as [P-14] directly states Tylenol use and effect; ignores this. 'Knowledge graph' hallucinated (no such source). Multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response around prescribed/OTC meds, conditions, and OTC effectiveness per question; no off-topic content despite errors."
