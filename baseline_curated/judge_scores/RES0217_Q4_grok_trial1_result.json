  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer's key facts: bullseye rash assessed and absent [D-6/P-6], joint pain [D-7], fever/illness [D-8], headaches [D-19] all denied; proposed tests include tick identification [D-6/D-18], serology/blood work [D-18], physical exam [D-18]. No contradictions or errors, but minor discrepancies in not explicitly noting 'feeling well otherwise' [D-18/P-18], 'no other bites' [P-9], and physician consultation [D-13/D-22]; also specifies '*Ixodes*' which aligns with 'deer tick' but not verbatim.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: bullseye rash (yes), joint pain (yes), fever/systemic illness (yes), headaches (yes), tick to lab for species ID (yes, detailed), blood work/serology (yes), physical exam (yes). Missed/minor: 'feeling well otherwise' [D-18/P-18], no other bites [P-9], physician consult [D-13/D-22], explicit bite site focus for exam, patient bringing tick [P-1]. Covers approximately 80-90% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: inquiries/citations for rash [D-6/P-6], joint [D-7], fever [D-8], headaches [D-19], tick ID [D-5/D-6/D-18], serology [D-18], phys exam [D-18]. '*Ixodes*' is accurate synonym for deer tick (primary Lyme vector) per medical knowledge and context [D-5], no fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question: sections on assessed clinical features (with absence implied by denials) and proposed tests, no off-topic content, directly mirrors question's two parts."
