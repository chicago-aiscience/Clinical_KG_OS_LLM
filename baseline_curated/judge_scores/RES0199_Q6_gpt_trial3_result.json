{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All elements included in the Generated Answer (COVID swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing only if positive, and supportive care: hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches) are consistent with the Gold Answer and supported by [D-52]. No contradictory or incorrect clinical claims were made.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer correctly includes: COVID-19 swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and all listed supportive-care measures. However, it omits several components present in the Gold Answer’s “complete management plan,” including: expected test turnaround time (24–48 hours), the note that if not COVID it could be another viral illness, the explicit statement that management is supportive regardless of result, and the clarification that no prescription medications were ordered beyond supportive measures. Overall coverage is partial rather than near-complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims made are grounded in [D-52]. The answer does not introduce new diagnoses, therapies, or timelines not found in the transcript. Minor paraphrasing (e.g., 'solely') remains faithful to the transcript’s meaning.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what the question asks for (test ordered, isolation duration, conditions for contact tracing, and supportive care recommendations) with no substantive tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, faithful, and highly relevant, but it is not fully complete compared with the Gold Answer because it omits the stated test turnaround time and several additional management-plan details included in [D-52]."
