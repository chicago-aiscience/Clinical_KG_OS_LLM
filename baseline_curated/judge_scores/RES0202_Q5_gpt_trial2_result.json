  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer: it correctly identifies school attendance as the suspected source (mother wondered he could have gotten COVID at school [P-2]) and correctly notes the symptom onset after returning from school Wednesday [P-1]. It correctly reports no known sick contacts outside of school [P-38] and that it was “hard to say” regarding sick contacts at school [P-38]. It also correctly states the school had not contacted the family about exposures [P-39].\nMinor inaccuracies/misattributions: it references “knowledge graph” (not in transcript) and cites [D-44] to support the mother’s motivation for testing; [D-44] is the clinician’s plan, while the mother’s school-related testing rationale is better supported by [P-41].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) school as suspected source, (2) symptoms began after school, (3) no sick contacts outside school, (4) uncertainty about school contacts, (5) no school notification of exposures.\nKey point missed from the Gold Answer that is directly relevant to the question: the mother’s report that the school required a COVID test for return and that this was tied to the school notifying other families about exposures [P-41].\nGold Answer points not included: lack of travel and lack of home environmental exposures; these are less central to the question asked but were included in the Gold Answer context.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references ([P-1], [P-2], [P-38], [P-39]). However, “knowledge graph” is not supported by the transcript, and the use of [D-44] to justify the mother’s reasoning is a mild citation/attribution issue (it is the doctor’s statement, not the mother’s). Overall, only minor ungrounded elements.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on how school attendance factored into suspected source and what was reported about sick contacts at school vs outside of school, including whether the school notified them. Minimal extraneous content."
