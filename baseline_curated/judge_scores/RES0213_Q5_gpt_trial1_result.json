  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns with the Gold Answer’s main causal story (father’s early MI → fear; smoking → perceived risk + stress; psychosocial stress/anxiety → symptom vigilance). It correctly quotes/uses [P-8] and [P-19] and notes symptoms are noticed when alone/studying ([P-29]). However, it contains notable inaccuracies: (1) it states “the transcript does not confirm current active smoking,” but the patient explicitly reports she is still smoking (reduced) ([P-14], [P-18]); (2) it repeatedly references a “knowledge graph” and “diagnosis,” neither of which exist in the transcript or Gold Answer framing; (3) it implies the pain is “likely driven” by anxiety in a more definitive way than the Gold Answer (which presents the patient’s uncertainty and connections rather than concluding etiology).",
    "completeness": "It covers the three required domains (family history, smoking, psychosocial stressors) and gives some illustrative transcript details (father’s MI last year/in his 50s; quitting is hard; thesis/school stress; rapid breathing when nervous; symptoms when alone). Key Gold Answer elements that are missing or under-specified include: father now seeing “a lot of heart doctors” ([P-30]); paternal grandfather history being unknown due to accidental death ([P-30]); detailed smoking timeline (started ~18; up to ~10/day for two years; cut to ~5/day) ([P-14], [P-18]); living alone/limited social contact ([P-26], [P-27]); nervous about running lately ([P-28]); and the explicit point that prior anxiety attacks may be returning ([P-22]).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “knowledge graph,” “heart disease concern diagnosis,” and claims that the graph links stress directly to chest pain. The statement that current active smoking is not confirmed conflicts with the transcript. Most other claims (father’s MI, quitting difficulty, thesis pressure, nervous breathing, symptoms when alone) are supported by cited lines.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with her heart disease concern, and it uses consultation details to illustrate connections. Minor tangents include extraneous ‘knowledge graph/diagnosis’ framing, but overall it addresses the question directly."
