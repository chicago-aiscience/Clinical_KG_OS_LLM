  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the main respiratory symptoms (wheezing, cough, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing) reported at presentation and correctly notes wheezing as the earliest symptom with cough being more recent, matching the Gold Answer's core facts from P-1 and P-2. Minor discrepancies include not mentioning activity-related out-of-breath episodes [P-3], hard time catching breath without cyanosis [P-32], non-productive cough [P-31], or that the child looks fine [P-9], but these do not alter the primary factual content.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: wheezing for 4-5 days [P-1,P-2], slight cough more recent [P-1], shortness of breath/difficulty deep breaths as early symptoms [P-1,P-2], wheezing as earliest. Missed: out-of-breath with activity like playing tag [P-3], straining to breathe but no cyanosis [P-32], non-productive cough explicitly [P-31], looks fine otherwise [P-9]. Covers approximately 80% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: wheezing [P-1,P-2,P-43], cough [P-1], shortness of breath/difficulty breathing [P-1,P-2]; earliest wheezing and recent cough implied by phrasing in P-1 and confirmed in P-2. Citations are accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists the specific respiratory symptoms reported at presentation and clearly identifies wheezing as the earliest symptom four to five days ago, with cough noted as more recent, perfectly addressing both parts of the question without off-topic content."
