  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies fever and sore throat as the specific symptoms cited by the doctor for suspecting infectious etiology [D-53], matching the Gold Answer's explicit identification. It correctly links the lack of flu shot [D-53/P-53] to raising influenza [D-54]. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: fever/sore throat [D-53] (covered), broader symptoms [D-24] (missed), husband's symptoms [D-53] (missed), no flu shot [P-53] leading to influenza [D-54] (covered). Covers core specific symptoms and vaccination info directly answering the question (80-99%), but misses supportive context like broader cluster and epidemiology.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: symptoms from [P-1]/[D-53], flu shot from [D-53]/[P-53], influenza from [D-54]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the two-part question with focused sections on symptoms for infectious/COVID suspicion and vaccination for influenza differential; no off-topic content."
