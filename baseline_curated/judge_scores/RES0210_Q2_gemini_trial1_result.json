  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Lipitor for cholesterol as a prescribed medication. However, it incorrectly states that no over-the-counter (OTC) medications were mentioned. The transcript explicitly mentions Tylenol in [P-14] ('Yeah, I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit'). Note: although the transcript says 'haven't', the context of 'that helps a little bit' and the Gold Answer confirm this is a typo for 'have taken'. By claiming no OTC meds were mentioned, the Generated Answer provides an incorrect factual conclusion.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses a significant portion of the question. It fails to identify Tylenol as the OTC medication, fails to identify the condition it was used for (fever/symptoms), and fails to report its effectiveness ('helps a little bit'). It only covers the Lipitor portion of the query.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer claims 'the transcript does not mention the patient taking any specific over-the-counter (OTC) medications,' which is a hallucinated negative. Tylenol is explicitly named in [P-14].",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in structure, directly attempting to answer each part of the prompt, even though the content provided for the OTC sections is factually wrong based on the source text."
