  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the timeline of activities (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening) and the details of the prior tick bite (10 years ago, bullseye rash, antibiotics). It accurately compares the physical characteristics of the ticks (swollen vs. small) and the skin reactions (bullseye vs. localized redness).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few clinical details present in the gold answer: it does not mention the specific location of the hike (Strathroy), the patient's uncertainty about exactly when the tick attached, the 'earlier today' timing of discovery, or the doctor's specific estimate that the tick had been attached for at least 72 hours.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims regarding the timeline, the description of symptoms, and the comparison to the previous bite are directly supported by the provided text without hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, focusing strictly on the timeline of exposure and the comparison between the current and past episodes as requested in the prompt."
