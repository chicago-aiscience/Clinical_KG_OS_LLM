  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the symptoms (wheezing, cough, shortness of breath). However, it identifies 'Wheezy breathing' as the earliest symptom, whereas the Gold Answer (following P-2) identifies both 'wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths' as the symptoms noticed first. It correctly identifies the cough as appearing more recently.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the primary symptoms but misses some secondary details present in the Gold Answer, such as the cough being non-productive (no phlegm) and the absence of cyanosis (not turning blue). It also omits the specific context of activity (playing tag) mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using direct quotes and accurate citations for the points it includes. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question (symptoms at presentation and earliest symptoms) without irrelevant tangents."
