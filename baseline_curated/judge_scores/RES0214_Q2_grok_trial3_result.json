  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the current medication as multivitamins [P-40], allergy to penicillin [P-37], and specific reaction as rash [P-38], matching the core facts in the Gold Answer with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: multivitamins only [P-40], pre-diabetic with glucose monitoring but no Rx meds [P-33], no HBP [P-34], no cholesterol [P-35], penicillin allergy [P-37], rash reaction [P-38], no breathing trouble [P-39]. Generated covers multivitamins, allergy, and rash (core to question); misses pre-diabetic context, denials of other conditions, no breathing issues, and clinical relevance note (supportive details), but fully addresses the question's three elements, covering ~90% effectively.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (multivitamins [P-40], penicillin allergy [P-37], rash [P-38]) are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations; no hallucinated content or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer uses bullet points to directly and concisely address the exact question elements (medication regimen, drug allergy, specific adverse reaction) with no off-topic content."
