    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's viral infection conclusion and cites appropriate transcript evidence. However, it misses critical diagnostic reasoning: (1) discharge quality being 'mostly clear' [P-5] rather than colored (arguing against bacterial), (2) absence of fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, fevers/chills [P-7] (arguing against bacterial), (3) no exposure to fumes/dust/animals [P-22] plus no known allergies [P-28] (arguing against allergic), (4) symptom progression from stuffiness to runny nose [P-3], and (5) clarification that the nephew was NOT sick [P-12], making daycare exposure plausible but not confirmed. The answer also contains a fabricated reference to a 'Knowledge Graph' not present in the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 40% of the Gold Answer's key diagnostic evidence. It correctly identifies: duration (1 week), symptom types (stuffy/runny nose), daycare exposure, and the doctor's final assessment. However, it omits crucial differential diagnosis evidence: clear discharge quality, absence of fever/colored mucus (against bacterial), no environmental exposures/allergies (against allergic), absence of systemic symptoms (cough, sore throat, SOB, fevers/chills), symptom progression pattern, and the clarification that the nephew wasn't sick. These omissions represent over half of the diagnostic reasoning.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a significant hallucination: repeated references to a 'Knowledge Graph' and 'provided knowledge graph' that does not exist in the source transcript. The claim that 'The Knowledge Graph explicitly links daycare exposure to viral infection/common cold' is fabricated. Additionally, the characterization of daycare exposure as 'critical factor' overstates its importance since the nephew was reported as 'fine' [P-12]. Most other claims are verifiable in the transcript, though the daycare connection is misrepresented.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about evidence supporting viral vs. allergic/bacterial diagnosis. It focuses on symptom characteristics (type, duration), exposure history, and the doctor's assessment. However, it provides limited differential reasoning—the question specifically asks about evidence distinguishing viral from allergic OR bacterial causes, and the answer doesn't adequately explain what ruled out these alternatives beyond mentioning exposure history."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the viral infection conclusion and cites some relevant evidence (symptom duration, nasal symptoms, daycare exposure), but has significant weaknesses. It omits over half of the key diagnostic evidence from the Gold Answer, particularly critical elements that ruled out bacterial (clear discharge, no fever) and allergic (no environmental exposures, no allergies) causes. The answer contains a major hallucination about a non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' and mischaracterizes the daycare exposure by omitting that the nephew was not sick. While structurally relevant to the question, it fails to provide comprehensive differential diagnostic reasoning comparing viral, bacterial, and allergic etiologies."
