  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely consistent with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the diagnostic tests (tick ID, blood work, physical exam), the treatment (prophylactic antibiotics), the consultation plan, and the preventive advice. However, it incorrectly includes the patient's existing cholesterol medication (statins) as part of the doctor's 'clinical plan' when it was simply part of the medical history. It also omits the specific geographic risk factor (Strathroy) mentioned in the gold answer as a justification for treatment.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points (approx. 80%). It includes the three diagnostic steps, the antibiotic treatment, the physician consultation, and the primary preventive advice (habitat and insecticide). It misses the specific detail about the tick's 'waving motion' and the mention of 'Strathroy' as the specific geographic risk location.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. Most claims are directly supported by specific dialogue (e.g., [D-18] for the physical exam and labs). The inclusion of statins as a recommendation is a slight over-inference (hallucination of intent), as the doctor only confirmed the patient was taking them rather than advising their continuation as part of the new plan.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the multi-part question, organizing the response logically into the requested categories (Diagnostic Tests, Treatments, Consultation, and Preventive Advice)."
