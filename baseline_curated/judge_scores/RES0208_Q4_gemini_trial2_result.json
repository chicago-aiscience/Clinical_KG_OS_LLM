  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It identifies 'sore throat' as a negated symptom, but the patient actually confirmed it ('I think so' [P-9]). It claims 'loss of smell' was absent, but the patient confirmed it was affected ('yeah, kind of' [P-6]). It misses the vast majority of the negated symptoms listed in the Gold Answer, such as vision/hearing changes, nausea/vomiting, palpitations, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and numbness/tingling.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete. It fails to list most of the symptoms explicitly mentioned in the prompt (palpitations, nausea) and the Gold Answer (vision, hearing, abdominal pain, etc.). While it mentions chest pain and runny nose in the second section, it excludes them from the primary list of negated symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that loss of smell was absent based on the doctor's summary, ignoring the patient's direct confirmation in the transcript ([P-6]). It also misrepresents the patient's response to the sore throat question.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer follows the requested structure and attempts to answer both parts of the question, but the content provided is largely inaccurate or incomplete based on the source text."
