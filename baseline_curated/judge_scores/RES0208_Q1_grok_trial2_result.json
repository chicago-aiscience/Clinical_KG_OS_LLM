  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer includes some accurate symptoms like overall achiness [P-20], loss of appetite [P-2], and headaches [P-11], but misplaces headaches under sensory changes (Gold categorizes as constitutional), interprets 'dry' feeling as throat sensation rather than cough [P-8], omits key symptoms like loss of taste/smell, fever, sore throat, denial of runny nose, and general weakness under musculoskeletal; significant errors in coverage and categorization contradict Gold's accurate summary.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: loss of taste [P-4], diminished smell [P-6/P-5], early dry cough [P-7/8], mild sore throat [P-9], denied runny nose [P-10], overall achy [P-20/21], weakness [P-2], fever [P-4], decreased appetite [P-2/4/18], headaches [P-11-13]. Generated covers: headaches, partial cough/throat, achy, weakness (debatable as chief), appetite; misses taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose denial, fever (5/10 key points, ~20-49%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., achy [P-20], appetite [P-2], headaches [P-11], dry feeling/cough [P-8]); no hallucinations or fabricated details, though interpretive phrasing like 'Dry Throat Sensation' is still grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response by the question's specified categories (sensory, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional), focuses on patient-reported symptoms beyond chief complaints, with no off-topic content."
