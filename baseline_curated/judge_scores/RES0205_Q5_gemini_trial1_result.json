  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the role of acid reflux (including dietary management), hay fever (airway sensitivity), and occupational risk (hospital clerk, exposure, PPE). It also correctly identifies the post-viral pattern (resolution of flu symptoms while the cough persists).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points including the mechanisms of reflux and hay fever in relation to cough, and the occupational risk factors. However, it misses the specific point in the Gold Answer regarding the patient's anxiety history and the social pressure from coworkers ('scared' colleagues) as context for seeking medical attention.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using specific markers (e.g., [P-14], [P-17]) accurately to support its claims. It correctly identifies the patient's role as a clerk and their use of PPE.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the question, specifically detailing how the medical history (reflux, hay fever) and occupation (hospital clerk) each relate to the cough presentation. It remains focused on the prompt throughout."
