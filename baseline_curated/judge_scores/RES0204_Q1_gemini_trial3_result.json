  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the available information. It claims the transcript does not provide details on the nature of the cough or the appearance of nasal discharge. However, the transcript explicitly states the cough was 'dry' [D-5, P-5] and non-productive ('no gunk') [D-6, P-6], and the nasal discharge was 'pretty clear' [D-12, P-12].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the specific details requested in the prompt (nature of the cough and appearance of discharge), despite this information being present in the source text. It misses approximately 50% of the key points found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a form of negative hallucination by asserting that specific clinical details are missing from the transcript when they are clearly present. It correctly identifies the duration of symptoms but fails on the descriptive characteristics.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question and structure requested, but the content within those sections is incorrect or incomplete."
