  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is fully consistent with the Gold Answer in all factual details about the physical exam, diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), self-isolation instructions, timeline (24-48 hours), and disposition criteria (based on results). It accurately quotes or paraphrases transcript elements matching the Gold, with no contradictions or errors, though it does not explicitly note the absence of numerical thresholds (but does not contradict it).",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: physical exam (chest-focused), diagnostic tests (both specified), self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate), timeline (24-48 hours), disposition criteria (based on results), and progression to exam. Missed: explicit mention of 'public health nurse' contacting if positive.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about the management plan are directly verifiable in [D-36-38] of the transcript with accurate citations. No hallucinated facts in the plan details. Minor issue: introductory reference to a 'knowledge graph,' which is not present in the provided transcript (unverifiable fabrication), but the rest is fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured with headings directly matching the question's elements (physical exam, tests, self-isolation, timeline, criteria), perfectly addressing the query with no off-topic content beyond a brief accurate clinical impression and the minor intro phrase."
