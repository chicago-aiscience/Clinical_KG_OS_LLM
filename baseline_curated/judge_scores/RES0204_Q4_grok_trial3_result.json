  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition ruled out and accurately lists the key symptoms (shortness of breath and wheezing absent even during physical activity) cited by the mother, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. However, it inaccurately attributes the family history report to the patient at [P-13] (which discusses fevers, not family history), whereas the Gold Answer correctly attributes it to the mother at [P-28] specifying grandparents; this is a factual discrepancy but does not alter the main point.",
    "completeness": "Covered: asthma as condition; positive family history; mother cited no shortness of breath, no wheezing even with physical activity; prior workup. Missed: specific mention of grandparents; doctor’s question [D-28] and acknowledgment [D-30]; patient’s report of being healthy otherwise [P-24]; mother’s conclusion 'he doesn't have that'. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about asthma, symptoms absent even with activity, and prior workup are directly verifiable at [P-28]. However, family history 'reported by the patient ([P-13])' is not verifiable—[P-13] is about fevers, and [P-28] is mother's statement; this misattribution introduces an inaccuracy, though the rest is grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly identifies the condition (asthma), notes family history, and specifies the exact symptoms not exhibited (even during activity) as cited by the mother, perfectly addressing the question without off-topic content."
