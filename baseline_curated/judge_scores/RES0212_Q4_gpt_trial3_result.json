  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer does not correctly identify the main constitutional symptoms and exposure risks that were explicitly screened and denied. It largely omits key denied symptoms (night sweats, weight loss/loose clothes, hemoptysis) and key exposure risks (sick contacts, roommate illness, travel, illicit/IV drug use). It incorrectly reframes constitutional screening as “generalized pain/fatigue” and mislabels cats/alcohol as the main exposure risks, which is not what the clinician was screening for in the cough workup. The discussion of TB as a target of screening is directionally correct, but other condition inferences (e.g., bronchiectasis/chronic bronchitis, sepsis, ‘bacterial component’) are not supported by the Gold Answer and are not grounded in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) TB as a serious condition these questions help exclude (partially). \nKey Gold Answer points missed: (1) denial of night sweats, (2) denial of unexplained weight loss/loose clothes, (3) denial of hemoptysis, (4) denial of sick contacts (class/recent/roommate), (5) denial of travel/exotic locales, (6) denial of cocaine/heroin and IV drug use, (7) denial of stiff neck, nausea/vomiting, body pain, and (8) mention that hemoptysis screening reduces concern for TB/lung malignancy and travel relates to endemic infections/TB regions. Overall, far below 50% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not grounded in the transcript and/or misattribute clinical intent: references to a “knowledge graph” are extraneous; cats/alcohol are presented as key exposure risks though they were not asked in the context of infectious exposure screening; claims about ‘green sputum indicates a bacterial component,’ bronchiectasis/chronic bronchitis, and sepsis are not stated in the transcript. While chest pain was asked about, the answer’s synthesis of constitutional symptom screening is not faithful to what was actually asked (night sweats/weight loss/hemoptysis were asked and denied but not reported).",
    "relevance": "The response partially addresses the question by discussing TB and chronic cough, but it fails to list the specific screened-and-denied constitutional symptoms and exposure risks requested. It includes tangential or misfocused content (cats, alcohol, bronchiectasis, sepsis) rather than the transcript-grounded screening items."
