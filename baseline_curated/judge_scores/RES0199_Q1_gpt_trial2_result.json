  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared to the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer correctly identifies the cough as mostly dry and correctly reports two vomiting episodes. However, it contains a clear factual error by stating that the transcript does not provide diarrhea frequency; the transcript explicitly says “five or six times a day” [P-28]. It also fails to provide the requested headache severity rating (7/10 [P-8]) and substitutes non-responsive descriptors (“pretty persistent,” “really sick”) instead of the numeric severity. These issues are significant relative to what was asked.",
    "completeness": "Key points requested vs. covered:\n- Nature of cough: Covered (dry) but misses key specifics from Gold (no sputum/blood; stable over 4 days; no SOB/wheeze/chest pain).\n- Diarrhea frequency: Missed (should be 5–6 times/day) and incorrectly stated as not provided.\n- Vomiting episodes: Covered (two), but misses characteristics (food contents; no blood) and associated nausea timing.\n- Headache severity rating: Missed (should be 7/10); also omits other key characteristics in Gold (location, persistence, no radiation/neck stiffness).\nOverall, it captures only a minority of the required specific characteristics.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded (dry cough; vomiting twice), but the answer includes an unfaithful claim that diarrhea frequency is not provided, which directly contradicts [P-28]. It also implies headache characterization as an alternative to the requested severity rating rather than reporting the transcript’s 7/10. No major invented symptoms are introduced, but the incorrect diarrhea-frequency claim is a notable transcript contradiction.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms and attempts to provide the requested characteristics (cough nature, diarrhea frequency, vomiting count, headache severity). However, it does not actually answer two of the four specific requested characteristics (diarrhea frequency, headache severity rating) and omits several relevant symptom characteristics present in the transcript."
