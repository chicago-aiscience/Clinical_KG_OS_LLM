  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the doctor's concluding remarks and the stated plan are not included in the transcript. This directly contradicts the provided source, which includes the plan in [D-33]. It also omits several clinical facts mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the duration of symptoms (1.5 weeks), specific failed treatments (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer), and pertinent negatives like the absence of fever and asthma.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover the first part of the prompt regarding the stated plan. For the clinical information section, it covers roughly 30-40% of the key points found in the Gold Answer, missing specific durations, treatment attempts, and several negative findings that inform the next steps.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends at [P-29], whereas it actually continues to [D-33]. Furthermore, it repeatedly references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the provided source transcript or context, indicating a reliance on external/hallucinated data structures.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. It addresses the clinical information gathered but fails to address the first half of the user's question due to its incorrect assertion that the closing remarks were missing."
