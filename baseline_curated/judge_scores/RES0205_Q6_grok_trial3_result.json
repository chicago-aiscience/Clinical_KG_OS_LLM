  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's stated plan from [D-37], including the exact physical exam components ('quick listen to your heart and lungs' and 'quick physical exam') and the process (consulting the supervising doctor, reviewing discussion, returning to discuss next steps), fully consistent with the Gold Answer's core facts without any factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) multi-step plan [D-37]; (2) exam components (auscultation of heart/lungs and quick physical exam); (3) collaborative process (consult supervising physician, review everything discussed, return to discuss next steps); (4) foreshadowed in [D-1]; (5) patient agreement [P-37]; (6) no diagnosis/meds, trainee context, transcript ends before findings. Generated covers 1-3 fully (exam and process details); misses 4-6 (foreshadowing, agreement, contextual notes), covering ~80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable from [D-37] with accurate quotes and citations; no hallucinated or unverifiable details, fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is perfectly structured in bullets to directly address the question's elements (plan at end, specified exam components, process for next steps) with no off-topic content."
