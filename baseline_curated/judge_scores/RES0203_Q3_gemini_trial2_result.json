    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary symptoms and the test method, but it misses several key explanatory points present in the gold answer: the fact that the patient initially suggested the diagnosis, the systematic exclusion of other symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, etc.) to establish a narrow symptom profile, and the instructions for self-isolation.",
