  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies the three triggers (exercise at gym/recess, cold air/winter, spring/pollen) and links them to worsening asthma symptoms, consistent with P-9 and P-11.\n- Correctly connects spring/pollen to possible allergic asthma and notes the clinician’s suspicion of allergies (clinician asks about allergies after pollen trigger), broadly consistent with D-12/P-12.\n- Correctly notes family history: sister has asthma (P-32).\n- Minor issues: frames family history as supporting the “diagnosis/likelihood” of asthma, but the child is already diagnosed (P-2), so it’s more about predisposition/atopic tendency than diagnosing.\n- Introduces “knowledge graph” as a source of linkage; this is not in the transcript and is an incorrect framing of evidence.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered:\n- All three triggers listed (exercise, cold air/winter, pollen/spring).\n- Recognizes allergy suspicion is prompted by pollen.\n- Notes sister with asthma.\n- Notes current poor control/increased bronchodilator use (but non-specific).\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed or only partially addressed:\n- The specific magnitude of rescue inhaler escalation: from ~once every two weeks to 5–6 times/week (P-8).\n- The patient said no other triggers (D-10/P-10).\n- The patient suspected allergies but was never formally diagnosed (P-12), and clinician’s explicit affirmation “that would make sense” (D-13).\n- Clinician revisited other allergies and patient denied others (D-31/P-31).\n- Family: no other breathing problems and no known family allergies (P-33/P-34).\n- Clinician suggestion that a medication change/controller therapy may be needed because rescue-only approach is insufficient (D-43).",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements about symptoms (dry cough, SOB, wheeze), triggers, and sister with asthma are supported by the transcript.\n- However, repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and claims that it “explicitly links” pollen to allergies are not present in the transcript and represent hallucinated sourcing.\n- Some interpretive statements (e.g., “solidify the clinical suspicion of asthma”) are loosely grounded but slightly misleading given established diagnosis.",
    "relevance": "- Directly addresses how the three triggers and sister’s asthma relate to the current exacerbation and why allergies are suspected.\n- Minimal tangential content; overall focused on the question."

  "summary": "The answer is relevant and mostly accurate about triggers and allergy suspicion, but it omits several key Gold details (notably the quantified increase in rescue use and specific allergy-history statements) and includes an ungrounded “knowledge graph” framing that reduces faithfulness."
