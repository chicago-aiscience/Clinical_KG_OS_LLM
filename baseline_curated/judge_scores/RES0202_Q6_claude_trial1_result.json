  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with both the Gold Answer and the transcript. All key facts match: COVID swab ordered, 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation, false negative possibility mentioned, alternative viral illness diagnosis if negative, and specific warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting). The mention of asthma being ruled out due to fever presence is also correctly stated.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major elements from the Gold Answer: (1) diagnostic test and turnaround time, (2) isolation period, (3) false negative possibility, (4) alternative diagnosis if negative, (5) specific warning signs with examples. However, it misses one minor detail from the Gold Answer - that isolation should include separation from the younger sister 'if possible.' It also doesn't explicitly mention 'watchful waiting' or note that no medications were prescribed, though these are implied.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The COVID swab order, 24-48 hour timeline, 14-day isolation, false negatives, alternative viral illness, and all warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting) are all present in [D-44] and [D-45] as cited. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses all components of the question: diagnostic test ordered, turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis, false negatives, and warning signs with examples. The organization follows the question structure logically with clear headings. All content is pertinent to answering the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-organized, and comprehensive response that addresses all major components of the question. It correctly identifies the COVID swab test with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation recommendation, possibility of false negatives, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and specific warning signs requiring ER visit. All information is faithfully grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The only minor gap is the omission of the detail about isolating from the younger sister 'if possible' and the explicit mention of 'watchful waiting' approach, preventing a perfect completeness score."
