  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the medication tried (decongestants), the patient's assessment (worked a little bit), and the doctor's recommendation (Tylenol Cold). These facts align perfectly with the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses one specific recommendation made by the doctor: staying 'well hydrated'. It also excludes the contextual information provided in the Gold Answer regarding the expected timeline for recovery (a few weeks) and the classification of treatment as 'supportive care'. However, it covers the primary medications requested by the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript with correct speaker citations. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the three components of the user's question without unnecessary filler."
