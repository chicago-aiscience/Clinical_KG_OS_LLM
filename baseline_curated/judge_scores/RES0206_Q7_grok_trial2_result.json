  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the transcript and aligns fully with the Gold Answer's interpretation. All cited references (e.g., [P-1], [P-26], [P-9], [P-40], [D-43]) are correct, with no contradictions or errors. Minor additions like smoking history are factual and relevant, though not emphasized in Gold. Core evolution and severity claims match.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: baseline manageability [P-1, P-26], lifestyle [P-23 vs P-28], symptom changes (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea [P-1]), exercise tolerance [P-4 implied], fever [P-9]. Missed: explicit progression 'getting a little worse' [P-2]; severity as 'worst that I've had' [P-3]; prior ED visits twice, no hospitalizations [P-5/6]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. No hallucinations; doctor's summary [D-43] paraphrased correctly. Inferences like 'decompensation' and 'respiratory infection' are grounded in patient and doctor statements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structured around baseline, 3-day evolution, and severity comparison, perfectly addressing the question's components with focused sections and no off-topic content, though severity comparison could explicitly reference priors more."
