  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the COVID swab, the 14-day isolation, the positive-test condition for contact tracing, and the supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics/NSAIDs). It retains the transcript's misspelling of 'NSAIDs' as 'anseads', but the factual intent remains correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all specific categories requested in the prompt. Compared to the gold answer, it misses two minor details: the expected 24-48 hour timeframe for test results and the doctor's mention of a possible alternative diagnosis (other viral illness).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is entirely grounded in the transcript, specifically referencing section [D-52]. There is no hallucinated information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured exactly according to the multi-part requirements of the question."
