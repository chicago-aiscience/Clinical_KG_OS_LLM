  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It states the doctor characterized the condition as a 'respiratory infection', which is an inference not present in the transcript. Furthermore, it claims 'subjective fever' guided the next steps, whereas the doctor explicitly stated in the summary [D-47] that the patient had 'no constitutional symptoms' (fever is a constitutional symptom). The Gold Answer correctly identifies that the doctor's assessment was a summary of symptoms and the absence of systemic illness, and that the review with supervising physicians was the guiding factor for next steps.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three parts of the question: the plan, the summary assessment, and the guiding information. However, it misses specific details found in the Gold Answer, such as the total three-month duration of the cough (mentioning only the three-day worsening) and the patient's specific concern about missing exercise.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on faithfulness by repeatedly citing a 'Knowledge Graph' that was not provided in the source context. It also hallucinates the medical diagnosis 'respiratory infection' as being part of the doctor's conveyed assessment, which is not supported by the transcript text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant as it structures its response to directly address each component of the prompt's question."

  "summary": "The answer provides a structured response but suffers from hallucinations regarding a 'knowledge graph' and a specific diagnosis not found in the transcript, while also contradicting the transcript's summary of constitutional symptoms."
