  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the hiking event and the symptoms (loss of taste/smell, cough). However, it introduces a 'Knowledge Graph Link' that is not present in the transcript or the gold answer, which presents a logical structure not grounded in the source. The description of 'brushed shoulders' is a slight variation of the transcript's 'brushed by us' but remains factually acceptable.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer. It fails to mention the patient's lifestyle context (online high school, staying at home), which is crucial for explaining why the hiking event was singled out. It also omits the fact that the patient explicitly stated they had no other possible exposures or sick contacts, and it excludes the detail about living with parents/siblings.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant hallucination in the form of a 'Knowledge Graph Link'. This structured logic (hiking exposure -> indicates -> covid-19) is not found in the transcript. The transcript discusses symptoms as the reason for the suspected diagnosis, while the hiking is just the only possible exposure event identified by the patient.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant to the question, specifically addressing the exposure event and the connection to the diagnosis, although it includes some irrelevant fabricated structural elements (the knowledge graph)."
