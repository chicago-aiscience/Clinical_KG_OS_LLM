  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and their approximate durations (4-5 days for cough, couple of days for runny nose), matching the Gold Answer. However, it contains significant factual errors by stating that the transcript 'does not provide specific information' on the cough being productive/non-productive and the appearance of nasal discharge, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript evidence: cough is described as 'dry' [D-5, P-5] and non-productive with no 'gunk' [D-6, P-6]; nasal discharge is 'pretty clear' [D-12, P-12]. It also omits cough severity staying the same, first-time dry cough, and pertinent negatives, leading to contradictions on core characteristics.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: two symptoms (cough, runny nose), cough duration (4-5 days), runny nose duration (couple days). Missed: cough explicitly dry/non-productive, no sputum/gunk, severity stayed the same, runny nose 'pretty clear', never had dry cough before/past runny noses shorter, pertinent negatives (no sore throat, chest pain, no SOB/wheezing). Covers ~30-40% of key points, primarily basic identification and durations, omitting detailed characteristics central to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about symptoms and durations are verifiable [P-2, P-4, P-11]. However, statements that transcript lacks info on cough nature (productive/non-productive) and nasal discharge appearance are false hallucinations, as these are explicitly discussed [D-5/P-5/P-6 for dry/non-productive cough; D-12/P-12 for clear discharge]. References to 'knowledge graph' are unverifiable (none provided). Multiple hallucinated absences undermine grounding.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured and focused on listing the respiratory symptoms, their characteristics (even if incorrectly claiming lacks details), directly addressing the question without any off-topic content or tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer identifies the correct symptoms and durations but significantly errs by hallucinating the absence of key characteristic details on cough nature and nasal discharge that are present in the transcript and Gold Answer, resulting in low correctness, completeness, and faithfulness."
