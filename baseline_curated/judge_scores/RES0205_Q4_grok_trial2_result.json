  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition and the 'covid test' [P-35] with accurate citation, matching Gold. However, it incorrectly claims the transcript 'does not explicitly state the exact time lag' between symptom onset and test, contradicting [P-36] ('test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago') and Gold's precise timing. Workplace concerns partially match (scared coworkers [P-35], hospital setting), but miss details like job as clerk [P-34], PPE [P-17], staying home, return eagerness [P-36], and medication motivation [P-35]. Additional 'knowledge graph' reference is extraneous. Some factual errors but core facts mostly correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: COVID-19 (100%), covid test [P-35] (100%), negative result (implied). Partial: timing (cites cough [P-2] but misses/denies [P-36] detail, ~50%). Workplace concerns: scared coworkers [P-35] (partial), hospital inferred; misses clerk [P-34], PPE [P-17], staying home/return/meds [P-35,P-36] (~30%). Overall covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: COVID-19/test/scared coworkers from [P-35], cough timing [P-2]. Incorrect claim 'does not explicitly state exact time lag' is not grounded (directly contradicted by [P-36]). 'Knowledge graph [PROCEDURE]' hallucinated, not in transcript. Hospital setting plausible inference from [P-34,P-17]. Some unverifiable/hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured with bullets directly addressing the four question elements (condition, test, timing, concerns); no off-topic content."
