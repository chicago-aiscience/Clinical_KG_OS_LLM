  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer regarding management measures. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with 24-48 hour results, the 14-day isolation period, and the specific mention of the younger sister. All citations reference [D-44], which is correct. The Generated Answer does not include the emergency warning signs or acknowledgment of possible false negatives/other viral illnesses, but these were not errors - just reduced comprehensiveness.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of the Gold Answer's key points. It includes: (1) COVID swab test with timeline, (2) 14-day isolation period, (3) separation from younger sister, and (4) appropriate citations. However, it omits: (1) return-to-ER precautions (high fever, neurological symptoms, weakness, dizziness, fainting), (2) discussion of false negatives and alternative viral illness, (3) no medications prescribed/supportive approach, (4) school's testing requirement, and (5) the 'if possible' qualifier on separating from sister. The three most critical management points are present, but important safety and contextual information is missing.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-44]. The COVID swab recommendation, 24-48 hour timeline, 14-day isolation period, and specific mention of the younger sister are all accurately cited and grounded in the source material. No hallucinated or fabricated information is present. The answer stays strictly within what was documented in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's three components: (1) diagnostic tests - COVID swab identified, (2) isolation instructions and duration - 14 days specified, (3) who to isolate from - younger sister named. The answer is well-organized using bullet points matching the question structure, and contains no irrelevant information. Every statement directly responds to what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually correct and highly relevant information that directly addresses all components of the question with proper citations. Its main limitation is completeness - while it captures the three core management measures requested (diagnostic test, isolation duration, and household member to isolate from), it omits important additional details present in the Gold Answer, particularly the return-to-ER precautions and discussion of false negatives/alternative diagnoses. The answer demonstrates perfect faithfulness to the source material and strong relevance, but achieves only moderate comprehensiveness by focusing narrowly on the explicit question components while excluding valuable contextual management information."
