  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the timeline and symptoms described in the transcript and gold answer.

    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few details found in the gold answer: it does not mention the 'runny nose' (P-16), the explicit mention of 'fatigue' on Friday (P-25), nor the clarification where the mother corrected the doctor's initial assumption of a 5-day illness to a 3-day illness (P-4).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims regarding the timing of the cough, fever, and appetite are directly supported by the provided text with accurate citations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, focusing exclusively on the day-by-day evolution of the illness as requested by the prompt."
