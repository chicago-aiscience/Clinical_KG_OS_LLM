  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core triad of symptoms (dry cough worsening over days, fever ~100-101°F on Friday, possible loss of taste) and the doctor's reasoning from D-44 (alignment with COVID) and D-45 (fever indicates infection over asthma), matching the Gold Answer's facts. Minor discrepancies include imprecise phrasing (e.g., '101 or something' vs. Gold's 'approximately 100.1 or 101°F') and addition of non-Gold elements like 'knowledge graph' references, which are not in the Gold Answer but do not alter core facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold fully covered: triad of dry cough [P-1,P-5,P-12 equivalents], fever details [P-1,P-2], loss of taste [P-17]; D-44 COVID alignment; D-45 fever distinguishing infection from asthma; collective use for viral/COVID prioritization. Systemic aspects (fatigue/decreased appetite implied via symptoms) and acute onset (3 days) addressed. 100% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (P-1, P-2, P-12, P-17, D-44, D-45). However, multiple hallucinations: repeated 'knowledge graph', 'KG', 'LAB_RESULT', 'SYMPTOM' references not present in transcript, fabricating external validation.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around the specified symptom combination (respiratory, temperature, taste) and doctor's collective reasoning for COVID alignment and infectious conclusion, with no off-topic content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly complete, relevant, and mostly correct in recapping the Gold Answer's key facts and transcript-grounded reasoning, but is undermined by multiple hallucinated 'knowledge graph' references."
