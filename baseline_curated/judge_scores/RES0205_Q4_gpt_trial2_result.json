  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Condition ruled out: Matches Gold (COVID-19).\n- Test used: Matches Gold (a “covid test”).\n- Timing: Incorrect versus Gold/transcript. The transcript explicitly states the test was done at symptom onset: “when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago” [P-36]. The Generated Answer instead claims the transcript does not specify the time lag, which directly conflicts with the provided evidence.\n- Workplace-related concerns: Partly correct (coworkers scared when patient coughs), but omits other key workplace-related facts in Gold (hospital clerk role, PPE/infection-control context, staying home awaiting improvement, desire to return without coughing).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements:\n1) COVID-19 ruled out — Covered.\n2) Specific test: COVID test — Covered.\n3) When performed relative to onset: at onset (~2 weeks before visit) — Missed/incorrectly stated as unspecified.\n4) Workplace-related concerns: hospital workplace context + coworkers fear + PPE awareness + staying home and wanting to return without coughing — Partially covered (only coworkers fear).\nOverall coverage is ~50–70% of key points, with a major miss on timing and partial workplace context.",
    "faithfulness": "- The main claims (COVID test, coworkers scared) are supported by [P-35].\n- However, the statement that timing is not explicitly stated is contradicted by [P-36], making this a notable unfaithful claim.\n- The mention of a “knowledge graph [PROCEDURE]” is not in the transcript and is an extraneous, unverifiable detail (minor hallucination).",
    "relevance": "The answer is generally focused on the asked items (ruled-out condition, test, timing, workplace concerns). It does not go off-topic, but it fails to correctly answer the timing component and incompletely addresses the workplace-related concerns."
