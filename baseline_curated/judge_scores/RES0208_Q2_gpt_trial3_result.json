  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tums as a current medication and correctly states it is used for reflux. It also correctly describes the patient’s independent change: he stopped his prior reflux medication after identifying helpful/trigger foods and managing symptoms with diet. However, it omits Avodart (dutasteride) entirely, which is a key current medication in the transcript, and therefore the list of “current medications” is not factually correct as a complete answer to the question.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Avodart for enlarged prostate/BPH, (2) Tums PRN for reflux, (3) stopped prior reflux medication after dietary modification, (4) denial of allergies (optional/extra in Gold). Generated Answer includes (2) and (3) but misses (1) and (4). This is about half of the main required content and misses a major medication/indication pairing.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements about Tums for reflux and stopping prior reflux medication due to dietary management are supported by the transcript [P-27]. The inclusion of a “[Knowledge Graph]” citation is not supported by the provided transcript and is an unverifiable reference, but it does not add new clinical facts beyond what is in [P-27]. No other clear hallucinated clinical details are present.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on medications and the reflux-medication change, which is what was asked. However, it fails to answer the full question because it does not list all current medications and their indications (missing Avodart/BPH)."
