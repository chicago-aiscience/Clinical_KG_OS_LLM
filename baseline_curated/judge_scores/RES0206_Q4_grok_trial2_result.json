{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out [D-43], the COVID swab as the test [D-43], and accurately paraphrases/quotes the key social contact detail from P-20 (meeting friends for dog walks outdoors, one sick, walking too close despite feeling safe outside). All facts match the Gold Answer and transcript with no errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) COVID-19 condition [D-43]; (2) COVID swab test [D-43]; (3) social contacts detail - meets friends for dog walks outside, one sick 'a bit sick for a bit', sometimes too close, false safety outdoors [P-20]; (4) unsure if friend got COVID test [P-21]; (5) screening for COVID symptoms (smell/taste/confusion/aches denied) [P-32/33/34/35]; (6) no recent travel [P-31]; (7) rationale despite absent symptoms. Generated covers 1-3 fully (80-99% of core question-answering points), misses 4-7 (supplementary details).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: COVID-19 and swab from [D-43]; social contacts details/quotes from [P-20] (e.g., 'friends to walk dogs', 'sick', 'too safe', 'little too close'). No hallucination, citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by stating the condition, test, and prompting social contact detail directly, with no off-topic content."
