  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and correctly states the testing was negative. It accurately links the investigation to hospital employment and a persistent cough after viral/flu-like symptoms. Minor inaccuracy: it implies the cough “worsened into a dry cough,” whereas the patient described the cough intensity as “kind of the same” and only the character shifted from initially productive to later dry.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: COVID-19 investigated; hospital worker/occupational context; viral/flu-like symptoms (runny nose/sore throat) with persistent cough; coworkers’ fear as contextual pressure; test result negative. Missing or under-specified: that the COVID test was performed at symptom onset ~2 weeks ago, that the patient has stayed home awaiting symptom resolution, and that the patient emphasized PPE use/being careful (which the Gold Answer includes as part of the context).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are supported by the transcript (hospital worker, initial flu-like symptoms resolving while cough persisted, coworkers scared, negative COVID test). The main weak point is the wording suggesting worsening, which is not supported. Otherwise, no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question (diagnosis investigated, why it was investigated, and what testing showed) without extraneous content."

  "summary": "The answer is largely accurate and well-focused, capturing the main rationale and negative COVID-19 result, but it omits some contextual details (test timing/home isolation/PPE) and slightly overstates symptom worsening."
