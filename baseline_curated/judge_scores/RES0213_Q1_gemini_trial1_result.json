  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the 'sharp and strong' quality and the '20 minutes' duration. However, it incorrectly suggests that the pain only occurs during anxiety attacks based on P-20, whereas the transcript context for P-20 refers to heart palpitations ('fluttering'), not the chest pain itself. The patient mentions the pain occurs while walking or studying, which are not necessarily anxiety attacks.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: the 1.5-week overall duration of the symptoms, the initial descriptions of the pain as 'uncomfortable' and 'odd', the fact that the pain can occur at rest, and the negative findings (no worsening with exercise, no preceding injury, and no prior history).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a direct causal link between the chest pain resolution and 'outside of episodes involving an anxiety attack' using P-20. In the transcript, P-20 specifically addresses heart fluttering/palpitations, not the resolution of the chest pain. Other claims are well-grounded in P-3, P-6, and P-29.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing each sub-part of the question (quality, duration, occurrence, and resolution) using a clear, structured format."
