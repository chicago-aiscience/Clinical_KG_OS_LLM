  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer on key points: no current prescribed medications overall (implied), dietary management for acid reflux with specifics matching [P-25], no medications for cough (with desire expressed [P-35]), and no current anxiety treatment. Minor discrepancies: omits explicit past anxiety medication history [P-24], does not mention hay fever [P-27] or its lack of treatment, and does not emphasize the overall 'zero medications' summary. Core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: no prescribed meds [implicitly via sections], past anxiety meds omitted but current status noted, full coverage of acid reflux management [P-25], no reflux meds; cough no meds but wants them [P-35]; misses hay fever entirely and the doctor's plan [D-37]; partial on anxiety history. Covers ~70% of key points (strong on reflux/cough, partial anxiety, misses hay fever/exam plan).",
    "faithfulness": "All clinical claims are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-25] for reflux, [P-35] for cough/COVID). Symptom details for cough/chest soreness grounded [P-2,P-5,P-15]. Minor hallucination: references 'provided knowledge graph' not present in input/transcript. Otherwise fully grounded, no fabricated facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response by conditions (cough, reflux, anxiety) addressing current medication/treatment status, explicitly covers acid reflux management and lack of prescribed meds as per question. Minor extra symptom details for cough are relevant to treatment context; no off-topic content."
