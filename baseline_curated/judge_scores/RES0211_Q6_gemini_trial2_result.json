  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly attributes 'scratchy throat' and 'post-nasal drip' to the doctor's summary in [D-58], whereas these were discussed earlier in the visit ([D-4], [D-18]). It also misses several key negative findings recapped in the summary: that the patient is not bringing anything up (no sputum), has no history of asthma, and is not taking medications other than Claritin.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses approximately 50% of the specific points mentioned in the doctor's summary (the negative findings). Regarding the patient's goals, it mentions the general 'next steps' but misses Jessica's specific goal of wanting to know if she needs medicine [P-60] and her desire to go home and rest [P-61], both of which are present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates that the doctor recapped 'scratchy throat' and 'post-nasal drip' in [D-58]. While these symptoms were mentioned earlier in the transcript, they were not part of the specific summary requested by the prompt.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant as it attempts to list clinical findings and goals, but its focus on general symptoms rather than the specific content of the doctor's recap reduces its utility."
