  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misses the Avodart (dutasteride) medication for enlarged prostate (BPH), which is explicitly stated in the Gold Answer and transcript [P-25, P-26] as a current medication. It correctly identifies Tums for reflux and the change to the reflux regimen (stopped previous prescription after dietary modifications), matching the Gold Answer. However, the inclusion of '[Knowledge Graph]' as a citation is inaccurate and not present in the transcript or Gold Answer, introducing a factual discrepancy. Overall, significant omissions make it not fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Avodart for BPH/enlarged prostate [P-25,P-26] - completely missed; (2) Tums as-needed for reflux [P-27] - covered; (3) independently discontinued previous reflux prescription after figuring out helpful foods/dietary changes [P-27] - covered; (4) doctor's positive response [D-28] - missed; (5) no allergies [P-28] - missed. Covers only ~40% of key points (reflux-related only).",
    "faithfulness": "Tums for reflux verifiable in [P-27]; change to regimen (stopped prior med due to diet) verifiable in [P-27]. However, '[Knowledge Graph]' is not in the transcript and appears hallucinated/invented as a citation source. No other major fabrications, but omission of Avodart doesn't count as hallucination. Claims are mostly grounded with one unverifiable detail.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses current reflux medication (Tums), its condition, and the specific change to prior reflux regimen with reason, which are core to the question. Misses the other current medication (Avodart) and its condition but stays on-topic with no irrelevant content or tangents."
