  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, correctly states that a COVID swab was ordered, and accurately attributes the concern to the patient’s report of walking with friends outdoors where one friend was sick and they sometimes walked “a little too close.” These points align with the Gold Answer and the transcript (notably D-43 and P-20). No contradictory or incorrect statements were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) test ordered = COVID swab, (3) prompting exposure detail = sick friend during dog-walking and sometimes too close outdoors. \nKey Gold Answer points not included: the doctor’s follow-up about whether the friend had a COVID test (D-21/P-21), and the additional COVID screening context (travel question and symptom screening: smell/taste, confusion, myalgias). While not strictly necessary to answer the question, these are included in the Gold Answer and thus represent missing coverage relative to it.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript: ruling out COVID and ordering a swab (D-43), and the sick friend/close outdoor contact detail (P-20). No apparent hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on exactly what was asked: condition to rule out, test ordered, and the exposure/contact detail prompting consideration. No irrelevant content."
