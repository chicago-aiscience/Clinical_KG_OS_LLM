  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as Asthma. However, it incorrectly asserts that the transcript evidence 'focuses' on cold weather and allergies over physical activity. In reality, the transcript explicitly mentions physical activity as a trigger in multiple places ([P-3], [P-6], [P-41]), which the Gold Answer correctly emphasizes. It also includes an external reference to a 'knowledge graph' not found in the source text.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key supporting points from the Gold Answer: the specific exercise triggers (tag, running), the resolution with rest (reversibility), the occurrence across multiple settings, and the pertinent negatives (lack of fever, phlegm, etc.) which help rule out infections. It covers approximately 40% of the evidence points identified in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains hallucinations regarding the source material. It references a 'knowledge graph' and a tag '[MEDICAL_HISTORY]' that do not exist in the provided transcript. Furthermore, it claims the transcript lacks a focus on physical activity, which is factually contradicted by the text in [P-3] and [P-41].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant as it directly attempts to answer the specific diagnosis question and identifies supporting evidence, even though some of that evidence identification is flawed or incomplete."
