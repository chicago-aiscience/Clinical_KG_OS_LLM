    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer lists specific evidence like absent cough [P-4], sore throat/SOB/fever/chills [P-7], post-nasal drip [P-6], clear discharge [P-5], duration details [P-2, P-8], progression [P-3], no allergies/exposures [P-22, P-28], no prior episodes [P-9], no fever/headache [P-7, P-14], and daycare exposure [P-11, P-12]. Generated correctly identifies basic symptoms [P-1], duration [P-1], doctor's conclusion [D-39], and daycare [P-11], all consistent with Gold/transcript. No direct contradictions, but introduces non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' links, a minor discrepancy as it fabricates source for evidence Gold derives from transcript alone. Core facts accurate. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) symptom type/absent features (congestion/rhinorrhea, no cough/SOB/etc.); (2) clear discharge; (3) 1-week duration/constant/progression; (4) against allergic (no exposures/allergies/priors); (5) against bacterial (no fever/headache/clear discharge); (6) daycare exposure; (7) doctor's conclusion. Generated covers: basic symptoms, partial duration, daycare exposure, doctor's conclusion (~4/10 points, partial). Misses absent features, discharge, progression, explicit differentiations vs. allergic/bacterial. Covers ~30-40%. Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims verifiable: symptoms/duration [P-1], daycare [P-11], doctor's statement [D-39]. But hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph' links daycare to viral diagnosis and treatments to KG, neither in transcript. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements (KG references). Misquotes P-11 slightly. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for evidence from symptoms (type/duration/discharge/absent) and exposure supporting viral vs. allergic/bacterial. Generated structures around symptoms/duration, exposure, doctor's assessment, directly addressing. KG tangent minor/off-topic but core focused on evidence for conclusion. Score: 4."
