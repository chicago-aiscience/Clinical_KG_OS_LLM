  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer’s main diagnosis of asthma aligns with the Gold Answer (pediatric asthma/exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in an atopic child). However, it incorrectly downplays/discounts physical activity as a trigger despite clear transcript evidence (e.g., out of breath playing tag [P-3], recurrent with activity and improves with rest [P-6], running in backyard [P-41]). It also frames the support as mainly cold weather/allergies, which is incomplete and partially misleading relative to the transcript and Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer support that IS covered: wheeze/cough/SOB symptoms [P-1, P-2]; cold weather worsens [P-38]; seasonal allergies/Reactine use [P-35, P-36]; intermittent/episodic nature with spontaneous improvement (partially, via [P-43]).\nKey Gold Answer support that is MISSING: explicit exercise-triggered pattern [P-3, P-6, P-41]; relief with rest [P-6, P-33]; occurs across multiple settings [P-38] (explicitly); nocturnal symptoms detail [P-43, P-44] (noted only indirectly); pertinent negatives arguing against infection (no fever [P-7], no runny nose [P-8], no sick contacts [P-10], no phlegm [P-31]). Also missing the more specific label “exercise-induced bronchoconstriction” and the ‘atopic predisposition’ framing.",
    "faithfulness": "Most cited elements are present in the transcript (wheeze/cough/SOB [P-1], difficulty deep breaths [P-2], cold worse [P-38], seasonal allergies/Reactine [P-35, P-36], nocturnal episode resolved [P-43]). However, the statement referencing “knowledge graph information… [MEDICAL_HISTORY]” is not in the transcript and is an ungrounded addition. The note implying the transcript does not really support physical activity triggers is contradicted by the transcript (so while not a hallucinated *fact*, it is an unfaithful interpretation of the provided evidence).",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the requested diagnosis and provides transcript-supported findings. It remains focused on respiratory diagnosis, but it does not fully address the question’s emphasis on exercise-triggering, multi-setting occurrence, and resolution with rest."
