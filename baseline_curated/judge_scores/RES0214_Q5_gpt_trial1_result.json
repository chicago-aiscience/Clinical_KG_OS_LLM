  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly captures the core epidemiologic reasoning in the Gold Answer: the husband’s week-long similar illness increases suspicion for COVID-19 and leads the doctor to prioritize ruling out COVID-19 first (consistent with D-53), and the lack of a flu shot keeps influenza on the differential (consistent with D-53–D-54). However, it contains a notable inaccuracy by implying the patient was “likely spreading them to her husband,” whereas the transcript indicates the husband was ill first (P-19–P-20), suggesting the opposite direction of transmission. Other statements (e.g., symptom overlap) are broadly true but are not the main epidemiologic focus of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points:\n1) Husband with similar symptoms for a week suggesting household transmission and prompting COVID-first rule-out: COVERED.\n2) Limited outside contacts (work from home, mainly at home together, no other sick contacts, only hiking exposure) supporting household transmission rather than independent exposures: MISSED.\n3) No flu shot increasing susceptibility and keeping influenza in differential: COVERED.\nOverall, it captures ~2 of the 3 central epidemiologic factors and misses the limited-exposure context emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Several claims are not grounded in the provided transcript: references to a “Knowledge Graph” and “[KG]” links are hallucinated/unverifiable, as no knowledge graph exists in the source. The statement implying the patient likely infected her husband conflicts with the transcript timeline (husband sick first). Most other claims are supported by cited transcript lines (P-19, D-53, D-54), but the presence of multiple ungrounded elements reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on how epidemiologic factors steer the COVID vs influenza differential (household sick contact; lack of flu vaccination). It adds some tangential material (general symptom overlap, isolation as containment) that is related but not strictly the epidemiologic comparison asked. Still, it remains mostly on-topic."
