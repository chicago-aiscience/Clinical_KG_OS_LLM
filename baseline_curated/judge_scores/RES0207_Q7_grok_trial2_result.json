  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core timeline events: seizure the previous night (P-8), feeling fine after and going to bed (P-8), missed Keppra dose as a contributing factor (P-9, P-23), sudden shortness of breath and dry cough upon waking (P-1, P-2, P-4), temperature check of 37.4°C that morning (P-5, P-6), and decision to seek care due to respiratory symptoms (P-1). It aligns with the Gold Answer on these facts. Minor discrepancies include not specifying the daughter's birthday celebration as the reason for missing the dose (P-24), lack of the ~3-hour symptom onset detail (P-11), omission of prior lack of shortness of breath (P-3), and uncertainty about seizure relation (P-8). References to a 'knowledge graph' and specific relationships (e.g., [TREATMENT] Keppra) are not in the Gold Answer but do not contradict it.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: evening missed dose leading to seizure (partially, without birthday details), seizure and post-seizure status (P-8, P-9), morning SOB and cough onset (P-1, P-4), temperature check (P-5, P-6), decision to seek care (P-1). Missed: daughter's birthday celebration disrupting routine (P-24), symptoms started ~3 hours before consultation (P-11), never experienced SOB before (P-3), uncertainty if seizure related (P-8). Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims (P-8, P-9, P-23, P-1, P-4, P-5) are directly verifiable in the transcript. The inference of missed dose causing seizure is plausible from P-9. However, references to a 'knowledge graph' and structured relationships (e.g., [MEDICAL_HISTORY] missed medication dose --[CAUSES]--> [SYMPTOM] seizure) are not present in the provided transcript, introducing unverifiable details that appear fabricated or assumed externally. No major hallucinations in core events.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly reconstructs the requested timeline from evening before (seizure, missed dose) to morning of consultation (respiratory symptoms, temp check, decision to seek care), structured chronologically with bullet points. Extra KG details are minor tangents but do not detract from focus on the question."
