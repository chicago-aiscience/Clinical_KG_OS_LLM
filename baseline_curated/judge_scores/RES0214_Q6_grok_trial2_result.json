  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the COVID-19 swab order [D-53] and self-isolation recommendation for patient and husband [D-53, D-54], matching Gold Answer facts. It correctly notes rationale from symptoms [P-1] and husband [P-19, D-53], and influenza possibility [D-54]. However, it omits the physical exam as next step [D-52] and consulting the supervising doctor [D-55], which are key parts of the Gold Answer's management plan, representing minor discrepancies while keeping core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID-19 swab (100%), self-isolation for patient and husband (100%). Missed: physical exam as immediate next step [D-52], consulting supervising physician and returning [D-55], patient agreement [P-54]. Covers approximately 50-60% of key points, focusing on test and precautions but incomplete on next steps.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in transcript: swab [D-53], self-isolation [D-53], husband symptoms [P-19], further workup/rule out COVID/influenza [D-53,D-54]. Symptoms rationale [P-1] grounded. No hallucinations; minor mention of 'clinical guidelines' not central or fabricated from transcript.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around diagnostic testing (test ordered), precautionary measures (isolation for patient/husband), and next steps (workup, rule out COVID), perfectly mirroring question components with no off-topic content."
