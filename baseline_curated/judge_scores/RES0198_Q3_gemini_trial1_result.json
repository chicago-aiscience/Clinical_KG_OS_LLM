  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the patient's symptoms (stuffy/runny nose), duration (one week), and the doctor's final diagnosis from the transcript. However, it references a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the context, though the facts it attributes to the transcript are correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly incomplete compared to the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the discharge quality ('mostly clear'), the absence of systemic symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat) used to rule out bacterial/viral severity, and the specific negative history (no allergies, no exposure to dust/fumes) used to rule out an allergic cause. It covers approximately 30-40% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates the presence of a 'provided knowledge graph' and attributes its reasoning to this non-existent source. While the specific fact about the nephew in daycare is in the transcript, the claim that a graph 'explicitly links' these points is a hallucination of the instructions/context.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the doctor's conclusion of a viral infection but largely ignores the second half of the question regarding why allergic or bacterial causes were excluded. It provides some relevant evidence but misses the differential diagnostic logic requested."
