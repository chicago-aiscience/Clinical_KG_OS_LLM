    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies asthma as the top differential, mentions the physical exam with lung auscultation, describes the rescue puffer trial as initial treatment, and outlines the contingency plan. The main discrepancy is the Generated Answer states 'asthma exacerbation' as the assessment, while the Gold Answer more cautiously states 'asthma reoccurring in some capacity' - this is a minor interpretive difference but both convey similar meaning. The Generated Answer also correctly notes cardiac ischemia being lower on the differential, consistent with D-36.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components from the Gold Answer: (1) overall assessment with asthma as top differential, (2) physical exam plan including lung auscultation, (3) rescue puffer trial as initial intervention, and (4) contingency plan to reassess if initial treatment fails. However, it omits two minor details: the doctor's statement about consulting 'the doc' (supervising physician) mentioned in D-35 and D-37, and the specific note that rescue inhalers are not currently available to the patient (though it mentions past use). These are relatively minor omissions that don't significantly impact the core clinical plan understanding.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript. All claims are verifiable: asthma as top differential is in D-35, physical exam/lung auscultation in D-35, rescue puffer recommendation in D-35, contingency plan in D-35/D-36, cardiac ischemia being lower on differential in D-36, and salbutamol use in P-25. The characterization as 'asthma exacerbation' is a reasonable clinical interpretation though not explicitly stated in those exact words - the transcript says 'reoccurring in some capacity' which could encompass exacerbation. No significant hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: overall assessment (asthma as primary consideration), physical examination plans (lung auscultation), first-step treatment (rescue puffer trial), and contingency approach (reassess if no improvement). The answer stays focused on these specific elements without significant tangential content. The additional context about cardiac ischemia being ruled out is relevant as it explains the reasoning behind the assessment."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and comprehensive response that addresses all major components of the question. It correctly identifies the clinical assessment, physical examination plan, initial treatment intervention, and contingency approach, all well-grounded in the transcript. Minor points include: (1) slight interpretive difference in characterizing the assessment as 'exacerbation' versus 'reoccurring in some capacity', and (2) omission of the detail about consulting the supervising physician. Overall, this is a high-quality response that faithfully represents the clinical plan outlined in the transcript."
