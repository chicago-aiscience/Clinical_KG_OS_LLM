{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core timeline for most symptoms. However, it contains a factual error regarding the cough; it states the patient did not explicitly vocalize the symptom, whereas in the transcript [P-7, P-8], the patient explicitly mentions feeling like they are 'starting one' and that 'it's on its way.'",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer: reduced appetite (present from onset [P-2]), diminished sense of smell (recent [P-6]), and headaches (emerging/current [P-11]). It also moves muscle aches to the 'emerging' category based on the doctor's summary, whereas the Gold Answer places them earlier.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are well-grounded in the transcript with citations. The main issue is the claim that the patient did not vocalize the cough, which contradicts [P-7] and [P-8].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the specific structure requested in the prompt (onset, recent, emerging)."
