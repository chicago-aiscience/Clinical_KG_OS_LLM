  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the dry cough, the specific temperature range (over 100°F/101°F), and the loss of taste as the key symptoms. It correctly captures the doctor's logic that the presence of fever differentiates the case from non-infectious conditions like asthma, aligning with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all parts of the question: it lists the three specific symptoms and explains how the doctor used them collectively (specifically using the fever to conclude an infectious process rather than asthma) to reach a diagnosis of suspected COVID-19.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is grounded in the transcript regarding the clinical details (D-44, D-45, P-1, P-17). However, it hallucinates references to an external 'knowledge graph' and includes metadata tags like [LAB_RESULT] and [KG] which are not present in the provided source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address the multi-part question asked by the user."
