{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's identification of the three primary symptoms (loss of smell, loss of taste, dry cough) and the specific test method (swab). It correctly cites the doctor's reasoning from the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the core requirements (symptoms and test method) but is less complete than the Gold Answer. It omits the patient's initial suggestion of COVID-19 (P-1) and the doctor's systematic process of ruling out other symptoms (fever, sore throat, etc.) to arrive at a 'narrow symptom profile,' which is a key part of the 'how' in the prompt's request.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is entirely faithful to the transcript. There are no hallucinations, and the citations provided (P-1, D-39) are accurate reflections of the conversation.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant and stays focused on the question without including unnecessary information."
