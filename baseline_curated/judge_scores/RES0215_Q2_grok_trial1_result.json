  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient takes Reactine (OTC antihistamine) occasionally for seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36], with no prescribed medications [P-36], which is fully consistent with the Gold Answer. No factual errors or contradictions; minor terminology issue ('patient mentions/states' refers to mother, not child), but core facts match perfectly.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) no meds/treatment for current respiratory episodes, resolves on own [P-33,34]; (2) occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies [P-35,36]; (3) no prescribed meds [P-36,46,47]; (4) past viral infections no antibiotics [P-16]. Generated covers (2) and (3) fully, misses (1) and (4) entirely (~50% coverage).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: seasonal allergies [P-35], Reactine sometimes OTC no prescribed [P-36]; citations accurate. Minor issues: 'patient mentions/states' (mother speaking); 'knowledge graph' not in transcript (slight hallucination/unverifiable). Mostly verifiable, no major fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications/treatments (Reactine for allergies/other condition) and no prescribed meds; focused on question with no off-topic content, though misses explicit 'no treatment for current episodes' aspect."
