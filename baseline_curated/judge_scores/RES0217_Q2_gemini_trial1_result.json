  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the current use of a statin for cholesterol and the proposal of prophylactic antibiotics for the tick bite. It correctly notes the patient could not remember the specific statin name and identifies the reasoning for antibiotics (attachment time >72 hours).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key details present in the Gold Answer: 1) The patient's lack of drug allergies. 2) The patient's past history of taking antibiotics for a tick bite 10 years ago. 3) The doctor's suggestion to use insecticide as an environmental treatment. 4) The mention that the doctor would consult a supervising physician before finalizing the plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is faithful to the transcript. While it references a 'knowledge graph' which was not explicitly provided in the source text block, the information derived (statin for cholesterol, antibiotics for Lyme) is fully supported by the transcript dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on the medications and treatments requested in the prompt without including unnecessary tangents."
