  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab as the diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. It also accurately identifies 'another viral illness' as the alternative diagnosis. All core facts align with the Gold Answer with no contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer: the condition (COVID-19), the test (swab), turnaround time (24-48 hours), and alternative diagnosis (viral illness). However, it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer such as the 14-day isolation instruction, public health contact tracing if positive, and the supportive management approach being the same regardless of diagnosis. These are relevant but not central to answering the specific question asked.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [D-52]. The reference to a 'knowledge graph' appears to be an artifact of the system that generated the answer rather than hallucination, as the core medical information presented (symptoms linked to COVID-19, supportive management) is consistent with the transcript content. No fabricated facts are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: (1) condition to rule out, (2) diagnostic test and turnaround time, and (3) alternative diagnosis. The structured format with bullet points makes it easy to identify each answer component. The additional context about symptoms and knowledge graph references, while potentially extraneous, does not detract significantly from relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and highly relevant response to the three-part clinical question. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab test with 24-48 hour turnaround, and viral illness as the alternative diagnosis, all with proper citations. While it omits some contextual details from the Gold Answer (isolation period, contact tracing, management approach), it fully addresses the core question components with no factual errors or hallucinations."
