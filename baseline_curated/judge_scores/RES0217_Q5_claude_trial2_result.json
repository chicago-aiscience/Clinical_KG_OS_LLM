  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the Friday hiking and Saturday gardening timeline and accurately quotes the doctor's 72-hour calculation [D-6]. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating that geographic mapping details are 'not present in the provided transcript segments,' when in fact the doctor explicitly discusses Strathroy's position on the Lyme disease distribution map at [D-13], stating 'Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.' This directly contradicts the Gold Answer's accurate representation of this geographic risk justification.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 50% of the key points. It adequately addresses the attachment duration reasoning (Friday hiking, Saturday gardening, 72-hour calculation), but completely omits the critical second component about Strathroy's geographic risk assessment using the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map [D-13]. It also fails to mention the doctor's conclusion that 'we will be moving forward with antibiotics' based on both factors combined [D-13].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major faithfulness violation. It explicitly claims that geographic mapping information is 'not present in the provided transcript segments,' which is demonstrably false. The doctor clearly states at [D-13]: 'I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up' and concludes 'Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.' This represents fabricated denial of transcript content rather than hallucination of new content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is partially relevant. It directly addresses the first part of the question about attachment duration calculation but fails to address the second part about geographic mapping justification. The statement denying the presence of geographic information is not only incorrect but also irrelevant to properly answering the question, as this information does exist in the transcript and is central to the question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question by correctly explaining the 72-hour attachment duration calculation based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening. However, it contains a critical factual error by claiming that Strathroy's position on the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map is not discussed in the transcript, when this geographic risk assessment is explicitly present at [D-13]. This omission represents both a completeness failure (missing 50% of required content) and a faithfulness violation (denying verifiable transcript content). The answer scores lowest on faithfulness due to the explicit false claim about missing information."
