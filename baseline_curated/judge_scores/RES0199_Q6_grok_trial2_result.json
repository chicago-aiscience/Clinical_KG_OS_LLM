  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the management plan from [D-52], including the COVID swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and all listed supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, rest, Tylenol for fever if develops, Tylenol/anseads for aches). Minor discrepancies include omitting the expected results timeline (24-48 hours), the alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative, and the explicit note of no prescription medications beyond supportive care; however, no factual errors or contradictions exist.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: COVID swab ordered, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, supportive care (well hydrated, nutritious food, sleeping well, antipyretics/Tylenol for fevers if any, Tylenol or NSAIDs/anseads for muscle aches/joint pains). Missed: results expected in 24-48 hours, alternative diagnosis if negative (another viral illness), and statement that no prescription medications were ordered beyond supportive measures. Covers approximately 80-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript, including exact phrasing for isolation duration, contact tracing condition, and supportive care recommendations (e.g., 'well hydrated', 'nutritious food', 'sleeping well', 'antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any', 'Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains'). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; 'anseads' matches transcript verbatim (likely transcription error for NSAIDs).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured precisely around the question's requested components (diagnostic test, self-isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), using clear headings and bullets with no off-topic content, directly addressing the query without extraneous information."
