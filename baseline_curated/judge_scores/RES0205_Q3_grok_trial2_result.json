  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and the negative test result, consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript [P-35]. Evidence points like hospital worker [P-17], persistent cough [P-2, P-5], initial flu-like symptoms [P-14], and coworker fear [P-35] align well. Minor discrepancy: states cough 'worsened into a dry cough,' but transcript indicates intensity stayed 'kind of the same' [P-7], though it did transition to dry [P-6]; core facts remain accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: diagnosis (COVID-19), hospital worker [P-17 vs. P-17/34], persistent cough, flu-like symptoms resolving [P-14], coworker fear [P-35], test negative/timing implied. Missed or partially covered: specific citations for sore throat/runny nose [P-13/14], PPE use/caution [P-17], exact test timing at onset [P-36], staying home post-test [P-36]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable in transcript: hospital work [P-17/34], cough details [P-2/5/6/7/14], test [P-35/36], coworker reaction [P-35]. Citations accurate. Minor issue: 'worsened' not directly supported (intensity same [P-7]), but transition to dry is factual [P-6]; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses all question parts: specifies diagnosis (COVID-19), lists prompting evidence (hospital role, symptoms, persistence, coworker fear), and test result (negative), with no off-topic content."
