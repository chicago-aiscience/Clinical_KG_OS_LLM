  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the Gold Answer: it states the clinician felt symptoms were consistent with COVID-19, planned a COVID swab and chest X-ray, instructed isolation until results return, and noted continued isolation may be needed despite a negative result if symptoms persist. No contradictory or incorrect clinical claims are introduced.",
    "completeness": "It covers the key elements asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) assessment consistent with COVID-19, (2) diagnostic tests: COVID swab and chest X-ray, (3) isolate until results, and (4) continue isolating if still symptomatic even if negative. It omits the additional contextual plan detail from the Gold Answer that the clinician would consult with the supervising physician and return to discuss next steps, which is part of the broader ‘management plan’ but not explicitly required by the question’s specified subparts.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly grounded in the transcript, especially [D-43]. The answer does not add unsupported details (e.g., no invented vitals, diagnoses, or treatment).",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested items: overall assessment, specific tests, isolation instructions, and the condition for continued isolation after results."
