  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns closely with the Gold Answer in factual content: both identify eczema as atopic marker increasing risk for airway disease, cat allergy supporting atopy and hyperresponsiveness, vaping as irritant causing inflammation and impaired defenses, and their combination lowering threshold for chronic inflammation leading to acute symptoms. Minor discrepancies include Generated Answer assuming more direct 'cat exposure' and chronic irritation without noting lack of documented exposures (as Gold does), adding 'sinus congestion' not explicitly in Gold or transcript, and generalizing immune hyper-responsiveness slightly differently; core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: atopic eczema [P-22] → risk airway disease/chronic cough (covers 3mo cough indirectly); cat allergy [P-27] → atopy/aeroallergen sens/hyperresp; vaping [P-36/37] → irritants/inflam/impair defenses; combo atopic+irritant → lower threshold chronic inflam → acute productive cough/sputum [P-9]. Missed/partial: explicit link to preceding 3-month intermittent cough; note on no specific cat exposures [P-13-15]; no formal testing/diagnosis. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims grounded in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., eczema P-22/23, cat P-27, vaping P-36, sputum P-9, cough P-2, sleep P-19). Explanations of mechanisms (atopy, irritants) are plausible inferences from facts, not hallucinations. Minor issue: '[KG]' appears erroneous/unverifiable (not in transcript); 'sinus congestion' inferred but not stated. Overall, verifiable and grounded.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly and comprehensively addresses how the three specified factors (marijuana vaping, cat allergy, eczema) collectively contribute to susceptibility to chronic/recurrent respiratory symptoms, using structured analysis with no off-topic content."
