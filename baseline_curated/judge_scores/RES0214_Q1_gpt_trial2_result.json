{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The four reported symptoms are correctly identified as fever (3 days), sore throat (persistent), stuffy nose (preceding fever), and muscle aches. However, the answer is incorrect in stating that the transcript does not contain explicit denials of cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing. The transcript clearly includes denials: nausea/vomiting [P-5], neck stiffness [P-7], headaches [P-8], cough [P-10], and difficulty swallowing [P-24–P-26]. It also introduces an unsupported claim about “ear pain,” which is not asked about in the provided transcript.",
    "completeness": "It fully covers the four positive symptoms, but completely fails to list the explicitly denied clinically significant symptoms (cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea/vomiting, difficulty swallowing) that the question specifically requests. Therefore, it covers only part of what was asked and misses all key negatives in the prompt’s list.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript: (1) the claim that denials of the listed symptoms “cannot be verified” directly contradicts multiple explicit denials in the transcript; (2) mention of “ear pain” is hallucinated/unsupported. The symptom positives are grounded, but the negative-symptom section is unfaithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the question (reported symptoms and denials). There is minimal tangential content, but it still attempts to address the requested denials (albeit incorrectly)."
