  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies three of the four symptoms (fever, sore throat, stuffy nose) but incorrectly states that the patient's explicit denials cannot be verified. The transcript clearly shows explicit denials at [P-5] for nausea, [P-7] for neck stiffness, [P-8] for headaches, [P-10] for cough, and [P-24] for difficulty swallowing. This is a significant factual error contradicting the Gold Answer and the actual transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only 3 of 4 reported symptoms correctly and completely fails to address the second part of the question about explicit denials. The Gold Answer provides detailed citations for all four symptoms and all five denials. The Generated Answer claims these denials 'cannot be verified' which is demonstrably false, making it severely incomplete.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is partially faithful to the transcript for the symptoms reported, but makes a critical factual error by claiming the denials 'cannot be verified' when they are explicitly present in the transcript at [P-5], [P-7], [P-8], [P-10], and [P-24]. This constitutes a failure to accurately represent information that is clearly documented in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address both parts of the question (reported symptoms and denied symptoms) but provides an incorrect conclusion for the second part. While it stays on topic, the erroneous claim that denials cannot be verified when they are explicitly documented makes the response partially irrelevant to what was actually asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies three of four reported symptoms but contains a critical error by claiming that the patient's explicit denials of cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing 'cannot be verified' when these denials are clearly documented in the transcript at [P-5], [P-7], [P-8], [P-10], and [P-24]. This represents both a significant factual error and severe incompleteness, as it fails to address half of what the question asked. The response is grounded in the transcript for the symptoms portion but demonstrates a failure to accurately read and represent the denial information that is explicitly present."
