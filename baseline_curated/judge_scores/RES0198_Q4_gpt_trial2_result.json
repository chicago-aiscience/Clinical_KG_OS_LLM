  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, specifies a COVID swab test, gives the expected 48-hour turnaround time, and accurately reports the isolation instruction while awaiting results. These align with the Gold Answer and the transcript. No factual contradictions noted.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points: (1) COVID-19 to be ruled out, (2) COVID swab ordered, (3) results expected in 48 hours, (4) isolate at home/avoid others. It omits one Gold Answer element: that after results return the patient would receive further instructions from public health.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript citations ([P-1], [D-39]). No apparent hallucinations or unsupported additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question (condition, test, turnaround, instructions) with no tangential material."
