{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and the gold answer. It correctly identifies the cough as persistent and dry, the mucus as resolved, and the chest soreness as present.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific details found in the gold answer. It summarizes sore throat and runny nose as 'flu-like symptoms' rather than naming them explicitly. It omits the specific characterization of the cough (frequency of 3-4 times per hour, lack of triggers, and stable intensity) and fails to mention any of the pertinent negatives (no fever, no shortness of breath, no GI symptoms) which are standard in clinical reporting of symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations for the points it includes. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question. While it includes 'Background Conditions' which are chronic rather than part of the acute two-week illness, these are clearly labeled as such and provide context to the patient's overall health reported during the consultation."
