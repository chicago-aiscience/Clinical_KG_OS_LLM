  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the two main physical examination components (heart and lungs auscultation, quick physical exam) and correctly describes the consultative process (consulting with supervising physician, reviewing discussion, returning to discuss next steps). All facts align with the Gold Answer and are directly supported by the transcript at [D-37].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the essential elements but lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) the foreshadowing at [D-1] that established this collaborative structure, (2) the patient's agreement to the plan [P-37], (3) the note that no diagnosis or medication was provided at this stage, and (4) the observation that the transcript ends before findings are shared. These missing elements provide important context but don't represent core factual omissions about the stated plan itself.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically at [D-37]. The citations are accurate and appropriate. No hallucinated content or unsupported claims are present. The answer stays grounded in what was explicitly stated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all aspects of the question: physical examination components and the process for determining next steps. It is focused and concise without irrelevant tangents. The structured format with bullet points enhances clarity and relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, faithful, and highly relevant response to the question, correctly identifying both physical examination components and the collaborative process for next steps. While it covers all essential facts from the Gold Answer, it lacks some contextual details (the foreshadowing at the beginning, patient agreement, and note about no diagnosis being provided) that would make it more complete. The answer demonstrates strong correctness and faithfulness with minor incompleteness."
