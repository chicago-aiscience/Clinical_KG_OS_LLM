  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the screening for palpitations/arrhythmias using correct citations [D-20, D-32, P-20], which aligns with elements in the Gold Answer (part of cardiac disease and inherited arrhythmias). However, it incorrectly states that the asthma patient response is not in the provided transcript (it is in [P-23, P-24]), introducing a factual error, and frames only this condition as specifically screened, understating the broader screening in Gold. Core facts on the listed condition are correct, but minor discrepancies exist. Score: 4.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers 6 key conditions (trauma, cardiac angina, infection, asthma, dyspnea, inherited arrhythmia) with specific questions/citations. Generated fully covers only palpitations/arrhythmias (overlapping Gold #2 and #6 partially), mentions asthma but dismisses it incorrectly. Covers ~20% of key points (1 main condition out of 6). Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about palpitations/arrhythmias are fully verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [D-20, D-32, P-20]. The statement that asthma response is 'not included in the provided transcript segments' is incorrect (full transcript includes [P-23, P-24]), representing a minor hallucination/misreading. Overall mostly grounded. Score: 4.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists screened conditions ruled out with specific questions and patient responses, mirroring the question's structure; no irrelevant content or tangents. Score: 5."
