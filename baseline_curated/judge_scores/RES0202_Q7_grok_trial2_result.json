  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the timeline: cough onset Wednesday night (dry, little), worsening slightly Thursday, further worsening Friday; fever first on Friday with approximate temperatures matching transcript/Gold; fatigue ('really tired') correctly placed on Thursday per P-1; decreased appetite and suspected loss of taste on Friday. Minor discrepancies include not noting runny nose on Friday (Gold/P-16), phrasing loss of taste as definite rather than suspected (P-17), and omitting mother's stepwise summary (P-12) and 3-day correction (P-4), but core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: Wed cough onset [P-1]; Thu cough worse + tired [P-1]; Fri cough worse + fever debut/temps [P-1,P-2] + dec appetite/loss taste [P-15,P-17]. Misses: mild runny nose Friday [P-16]; significant fatigue explicitly Friday [P-25]; mother's summary [P-12] and 3-day correction [P-4]. Covers ~85% of Gold's key points, strong on core progression.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in cited transcript sections: P-1 for timeline/cough progression/tired; P-2/P-1 for fever/temps; P-15/P-17 for appetite/taste. No hallucinations; minor interpretive phrasing (e.g., 'losing sense of taste' vs. mother's 'wonder if') but grounded and cited accurately.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured day-by-day from Wednesday evening to Friday, directly detailing cough onset (Wed night), severity progression (mild Wed -> worse Thu -> worse Fri), fever emergence (Fri), and symptoms like fatigue (Thu) and decreased appetite (Fri), with no off-topic content."
