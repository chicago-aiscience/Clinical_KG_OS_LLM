  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the timeline: cough onset Wednesday night (dry, little), worsening Thursday (a bit worse, tired), further worsening Friday with new fever (over 100°F, approx 101 or 100.1°F). It correctly places decreased appetite on Friday and references suspected loss of taste. Minor discrepancies include phrasing 'observed losing sense of taste' (transcript has mother 'wondering' [P-17]), omission of mild runny nose [P-16] and explicit Friday fatigue [P-25] (though Thursday tired is covered), and no mention of mother's summary [P-12] or 3-day correction [P-4]. Core facts align with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: Wed fine then dry cough night; Thu cough worse + tired; Fri cough worse + fever first time + dec appetite/loss taste suspicion. Missed: mild runny nose [P-16] on Fri, significant fatigue explicitly on Fri [P-25], mother's P-12 summary, 3-day correction [P-4]. Covers core progression and specified symptoms (cough timeline/severity, fever Fri, fatigue Thu, dec app Fri) ~85-90%.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Wed/Thu/Fri details [P-1], fever [P-1/P-2], appetite [P-15], taste [P-17]. Citations accurate. Slight overstatement on 'observed losing taste' (mother speculates), but grounded in transcript; no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured day-by-day from Wed eve to Fri, directly details cough onset/severity progression, fever emergence Fri, fatigue Thu, dec appetite Fri; no off-topic content."
