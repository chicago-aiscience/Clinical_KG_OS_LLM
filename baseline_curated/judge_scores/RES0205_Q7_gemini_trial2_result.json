  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript and the gold answer regarding the two-week duration, the 4-5 day window for mucus production, the 'whitish clear' description of the mucus, and the 3-4 day window for the resolution of other flu-like symptoms. It correctly identifies the transition to a dry cough.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key components from the gold answer and the prompt. Most significantly, it fails to address the prompt's specific requirement to describe how the cough's intensity and frequency changed over time (gold answer notes they stayed the same). It also omits specific symptoms like sore throat and runny nose, the absence of fever, the negative COVID test, and the specific frequency (3-4 times per hour).",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript. The use of patient markers like [P-6] and [P-14] aligns correctly with the source text. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question asked; however, because it completely ignores the final clause of the prompt regarding intensity and frequency changes, it is not perfectly focused on the complete set of instructions."
