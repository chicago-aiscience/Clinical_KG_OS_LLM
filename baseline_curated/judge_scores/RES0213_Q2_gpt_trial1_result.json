  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three OTC products the patient tried for chest discomfort (Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer) and accurately summarizes the patient’s statement that they did not help much. It also correctly identifies the multivitamin as the only routine supplement. No statements contradict the Gold Answer or transcript.",
    "completeness": "Includes: Tylenol, Advil, Alka‑Seltzer; that they were not very effective; routine multivitamin. Missing compared with the Gold Answer: the explicit clarification that the patient takes no other medications (no prescription meds) besides the multivitamin. (Gold also mentions stress-management habits and smoking reduction, but these are not OTC meds/supplements and are less central to the question.)",
    "faithfulness": "All included items are directly supported by the transcript citations ([P-6] for OTC trials and ineffectiveness; [P-25] for multivitamin). No hallucinated medications, supplements, or effects.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by listing OTC medications/supplements and reporting effectiveness, with no notable tangents."
