  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab as the diagnostic test and accurately cites [D-53]. The rationale section correctly identifies the household transmission pattern (husband with similar symptoms) and uses the exact quote from [D-53] about prioritizing COVID-19. However, it does not mention the self-isolation instructions or the flu shot discussion that provided additional context in the Gold Answer. The facts presented are accurate but slightly less comprehensive.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main key points: (1) COVID-19 swab test ordered, (2) household transmission pattern with husband having similar symptoms, and (3) the doctor's explicit statement about prioritizing COVID-19. However, it omits important contextual details present in the Gold Answer: (a) the self-isolation instructions given in [D-53] and [D-54], (b) the specific quote 'we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what', (c) the urgency of containing potentially transmissible infection, and (d) the fact that influenza was only mentioned after discussing COVID-19 and learning about no flu shot. Coverage is approximately 70% of Gold Answer key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The COVID-19 swab order is cited to [D-53], the husband's similar symptoms to [P-19], and the prioritization rationale quote is accurate from [D-53]. The symptoms mentioned (fever, sore throat) are correctly cited to [P-1]. No hallucinated information is present, though the presentation is somewhat simplified compared to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: what test was ordered and why COVID-19 was prioritized over influenza. It stays focused on these specific aspects without introducing irrelevant information. The structure clearly separates the diagnostic test from the rationale, making it easy to follow and perfectly aligned with what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate and well-grounded in the transcript, correctly identifying the COVID-19 swab test and the primary rationale (household transmission). It receives full marks for faithfulness and relevance. However, it lacks some important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, particularly the self-isolation instructions, the complete quote about ordering the swab 'no matter what,' and the temporal relationship between COVID-19 discussion and influenza mention. These omissions affect completeness, though the core facts remain correct."
