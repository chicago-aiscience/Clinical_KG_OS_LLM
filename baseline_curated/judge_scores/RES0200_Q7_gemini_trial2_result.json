  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the timeline. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the duration of the chronic cough, whereas [P-3] explicitly mentions 'the last 10 years.' It also identifies the COPD diagnosis as occurring 'a couple years ago' [P-1], failing to include the patient's clarification in [P-2] that it was 'probably five years ago.'",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it misses the 10-year onset of the cough and the 5-year COPD diagnosis milestone. While it correctly identifies the one-week and 'last few days' milestones, the missing historical context makes the timeline incomplete based on the question's specific requirements.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript but contains a 'false negative' hallucination by claiming the cough duration is not specified. This contradicts the source text [P-3].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to address every specific point mentioned in the prompt. However, its utility is diminished by the factual omissions."
