  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer and transcript. It correctly identifies the test (COVID swab), the turnaround time (24-48 hours), the isolation period (14 days), the differential diagnosis (other viral illness/infection), the ruling out of asthma due to fever, the possibility of false negatives, and the specific ER warning signs (high temperature, seizures, dizziness, fainting).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all components of the gold answer. It provides all the specific details requested in the prompt. It omits the minor detail of isolating from the younger sister and the summary statement that no medications were prescribed (watchful waiting), both of which are present in the gold answer's description of the 'complete' plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is entirely faithful to the transcript. Every claim made is supported by specific dialogue from the doctor, and citations (e.g., [D-44], [D-45]) are used accurately.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address each part of the user's multi-part question, making it easy to read and understand."
