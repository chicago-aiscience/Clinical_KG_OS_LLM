  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer: it correctly identifies no current prescribed medications for the cough, dietary management only for acid reflux with matching details (avoiding acidic foods and chocolates), and no current treatments for anxiety. Additional details like chest soreness, COVID test, and symptom descriptions align with the transcript and do not contradict the Gold. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) no prescribed meds overall [P-23]; (2) past anxiety med stopped 2-3 years ago [P-24]; (3) acid reflux managed by diet avoiding acidic foods/chocolates, helped a lot [P-25]; (4) no reflux meds; (5) hay fever no treatment [P-27]; (6) cough: wants meds [P-35], none prescribed, exam/consult planned [D-37]; (7) zero meds across anxiety/reflux/hay fever/cough. Covered: no meds for cough/reflux/anxiety, reflux diet details, cough desire for meds (~70% coverage, misses explicit overall no meds, past anxiety med timing, hay fever entirely, doctor's plan).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., cough [P-2][P-5][P-15][P-35], reflux [P-25], anxiety [P-22]). Minor unverifiable detail: mentions 'provided knowledge graph' not present in source transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by detailing current medication/treatment status across conditions (cough, acid reflux, anxiety), including reflux management and no prescribed meds; symptom details are directly relevant to treatment status."
