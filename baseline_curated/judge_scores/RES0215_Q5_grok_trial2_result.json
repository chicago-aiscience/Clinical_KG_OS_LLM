  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links the factors to an atopic/environmental profile suggesting hyperresponsive airways and asthma-like symptoms triggered by exercise and cold air, with citations and notes on other negatives. Generated Answer correctly identifies and links each factor (allergies [P-35/36], virals [P-15/16], carpets [P-54], cold [P-38]) to respiratory symptoms, with plausible medical reasoning matching Gold's core ideas of predisposition and triggers. Minor discrepancies: adds un-cited details like VOCs/dust mites (Gold says 'potential irritant' without specifics), KG reference (not in sources), less emphasis on exercise/rest resolution and other env negatives; core facts consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: atopic from allergies/OTC; virals trigger inflammation; carpets irritant (no temporal link); cold trigger; other env ok (no smoke/pets etc.); exercise [P-3/41]/rest [P-6] → hyperresponsive atopic child. Generated covers all four queried factors with links to symptoms/hyperresponsiveness; includes OTC use, cold/nighttime, virals history; infers convergence. Misses: explicit asthma/atopy association, other env assessments [P-53-57], no temporal note for carpets, full exercise/rest pattern emphasis. Covers ~85% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: citations accurate for allergies [P-35/36], cold [P-38/43], virals [P-15], carpets [P-54], presentation [P-1/2/3]. Hallucinations/minor unverifiable: 'KG & Transcript Correlation' and causal arrow graph (no KG in transcript/prompt); VOCs/dust mites for carpets plausible but not stated (Gold infers irritant generically). Overall mostly grounded with some added plausible inference.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how the four specified factors collectively relate to exercise-induced wheezing/distress: structures breakdown by factor, links to current symptoms (exercise from [P-3] implied), summarizes synergy. Intro on presentation relevant; no major off-topic content."
