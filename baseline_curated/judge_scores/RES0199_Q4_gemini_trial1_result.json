{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies all the primary components requested: COVID-19 as the condition, the swab as the test, the 24-48 hour turnaround, and a generic viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. These facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all parts of the specific question asked. However, compared to the Gold Answer, it omits the doctor's instructions regarding the 14-day isolation period and the mention of contact tracing by public health if positive. These details were included in the Gold Answer to provide a comprehensive response.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer attributes some information to a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source context. While the facts themselves (like symptoms and hydration) are present in the transcript, the reference to an external knowledge graph is a hallucination of the source format.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address each part of the user's multi-part question without unnecessary filler."
