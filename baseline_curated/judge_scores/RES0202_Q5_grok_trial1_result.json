  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the mother's suspicion that the child contracted COVID at school [P-2], the symptom onset after returning from school [P-1], no known sick contacts outside school [P-38], and uncertainty about school contacts ('hard to say') [P-38], matching Gold's core facts. Minor discrepancies include not explicitly stating the school had not notified them [P-39] (implied instead) and referencing [D-44] for testing motivation (while Gold cites [P-41]), but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: school as central suspected source, concern of COVID from school [P-2], symptoms post-school [P-1], no sick contacts outside school [P-38], hard to say at school [P-38]. Key points missed: explicit school non-notification [P-39], school COVID test requirement for return [P-41], no recent travel [D-40/P-40], no home environmental exposures [D-37/P-37]. Covers approximately 80% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-2, P-38]; no hallucinations. Reference to [D-44] for test motivation is grounded (doctor's plan aligns with mother's concern), though mother's school policy mention is in [P-41]. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured around the question's elements: school attendance's role in suspected source, mother's reports on sick contacts at school vs. outside, and lack of school notifications. No irrelevant content or tangents."
