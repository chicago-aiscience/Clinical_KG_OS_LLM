  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer regarding the diagnostic test (COVID swab) and the primary rationale for prioritization (the patient's husband being sick first, indicating household transmission).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points, including the specific test and the rationale concerning the husband's symptoms and the infectious nature of the presentation. However, it misses the Gold Answer's point about the sequence of the conversation (influenza being mentioned only after the flu shot query) and the specific emphasis on containment/isolation as a driver for prioritizing COVID-19.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. Every claim made, including the mention of fever/sore throat [P-1] and the husband's symptoms [P-19], is directly supported by the text provided.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly focused on the question asked, providing a clear section for the test and a clear section for the rationale without unnecessary information."
