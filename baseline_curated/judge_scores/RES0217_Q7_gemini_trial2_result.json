  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the source transcript and the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the activities on Friday and Saturday, the location of the current bite, the symptoms, and the comparison to the prior episode 10 years ago.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few specific details found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the geographic location (Strathroy), the patient's uncertainty/hope regarding the source of the tick (hiking vs. gardening), and the doctor's specific estimation that the tick had been attached for 'longer than at least 72 hours.'",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All claims regarding symptoms, timing of activities, and the physical state of the tick (small vs. swollen) are supported by the provided text with correct speaker tags.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and exclusively addresses the question's requirements concerning the timeline of exposure and the comparison between the current and prior clinical presentations."
