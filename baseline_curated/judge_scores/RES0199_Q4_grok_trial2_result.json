  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab as the test, 24-48 hours as TAT, and another viral illness as the alternative, all matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. Symptoms mentioned (headache, dry cough, loss of smell) are verifiable in transcript (e.g., [P-1], [P-11/P-12], [P-24]). No factual errors or contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: COVID-19 to rule out, swab test, 24-48 hours TAT, alternative viral illness if negative, supportive management noted indirectly. Missed: explicit mention of 14-day isolation, public health contact tracing if positive, and full 'either way supportive' phrasing.",
    "faithfulness": "Core claims (condition, test, TAT, alternative) verifiable in [D-52]. Patient symptoms verifiable in transcript. However, references to 'knowledge graph' and specific KG links (e.g., symptoms linked medically, hydration treatment) are not in transcript, representing hallucinated additions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address question elements (condition, test+TAT, alternative if negative) with bullet points; extras like symptoms are directly supportive and not tangential."
