  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the doctor calculated tick attachment duration based on Friday/Saturday outdoor activities and correctly quotes the '72 hours' threshold [D-6]. However, it contains a critical factual error by stating that geographic mapping data is 'not present' in the transcript. The transcript clearly shows the doctor discussing Strathroy's position: 'I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario' [D-12] and 'Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point' [D-13]. This directly contradicts the Generated Answer's claim that this detail is 'not present.'",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the Gold Answer's key points. It adequately addresses the attachment duration calculation but completely fails to address the second major component about geographic risk justification. The Gold Answer explicitly describes how the doctor used the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map to assess Strathroy's risk level [D-13] and how this geographic concern combined with attachment duration to justify antibiotic treatment. The Generated Answer incorrectly dismisses this entire dimension as 'not present.'",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination by claiming geographic mapping information is 'not present' when it clearly exists in the transcript at [D-12] and [D-13]. The doctor explicitly references checking 'a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario' and determines that 'Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.' This is a major departure from the source material, representing fabricated content about what is or isn't in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is partially relevant. It directly addresses the first part of the question about attachment duration calculation but actively dismisses the second part about geographic mapping as not being present in the transcript. This makes approximately 50% of the response off-topic or misleading, as it fails to address a key component of what was explicitly asked in the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly explains the 72-hour attachment duration calculation based on Friday/Saturday activities but contains a critical factual error by claiming geographic mapping data is 'not present' in the transcript. This contradicts clear evidence at [D-12] and [D-13] where the doctor explicitly discusses using the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map to assess Strathroy's risk level. The response covers only half the question's requirements, omitting the geographic justification component entirely while incorrectly stating it doesn't exist in the source material. This represents both incomplete coverage and a significant hallucination about transcript content."
