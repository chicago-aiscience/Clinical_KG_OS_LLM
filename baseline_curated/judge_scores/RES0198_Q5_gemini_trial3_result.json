  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the nephew's daycare as the exposure source and the patient's type 1 diabetes as the chronic condition. However, it incorrectly references a 'Knowledge Graph' which does not exist in the provided source materials. It also fails to note that the nephew was reported as 'fine' (not sick), which is a key nuance in the gold answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer: 1) the specific detail that the nephew was not currently sick, 2) the fact that the doctor never explicitly linked diabetes to immune function in the transcript, and 3) the duration of symptoms (one week) as a factor for the visit.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates a source called a 'Knowledge Graph' to justify the causal relationship between daycare and viral infections. This information, while medically plausible, is not grounded in the provided transcript text. Other claims regarding the patient's condition and the doctor's questions are faithful.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the two-part question regarding infectious exposure and the chronic medical condition."
