  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer provides precise chronology (Day 1: sore throat worsens progressively; shortly after: fatigue/muscle aches; Day 3: reduced taste constant; Day 4: breathing difficulty starts, constant and worsening) with specifics like swallowing issues, failed self-treatment, and overall progression. Generated Answer gets sore throat onset correct (4 days ago) but vaguely describes severity as 'remained distressing' without noting explicit worsening [P-4]; omits swallowing food difficulty; places systemic symptoms (fatigue/aches) without 'immediately after' timeline [P-26]; wrongly attributes total smell loss (transcript [P-19] indicates smell unaffected, only 'maybe taste a little bit'); no timeline for taste (2 days [P-20]) or breathing (yesterday [P-8]); misses constant nature [P-10, P-21], newness [P-11, P-22], and progressive accumulation. Significant factual discrepancies and contradictions (e.g., smell loss).",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: sore throat Day 1 worsens, swallow food issue/fluids ok [P-2,P-4]; aches/fatigue immediately after, tired not weak [P-25,P-26]; taste Day 3 constant/new, smell unaffected [P-19-22]; breathing Day 4 constant/worsening/new [P-8-11]; failed Rx [P-6]; overall progression. Generated covers sore throat onset/failed Rx; mentions aches/fatigue and taste/smell issue; breathing as last. Misses: all specific timelines except sore throat, swallowing details, 'immediately after'/constant/worsening/newness, smell unaffected, progression summary. Covers <50% of detailed key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Sore throat claims verifiable [P-2,P-6]; systemic symptoms verifiable [P-25] but timeline claim 'not quantified' ignores [P-26] 'immediately after'; sensory timeline vague, misinterprets [P-19] 'not smell' as total smell loss (hallucination, actually unaffected) and ignores [P-20] 'two days ago'/constant [P-21]; breathing onset not cited as yesterday [P-8], worsening [P-9]/constant [P-10] omitted, cites irrelevant [D-7,D-43]; adds 'medical knowledge' unwarranted. Multiple hallucinations (smell loss, vague timelines contradicting transcript) and unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly attempts chronological symptom order starting with sore throat and notes some severity changes; structured list matches question focus without off-topic content or tangents, though incomplete in details."
