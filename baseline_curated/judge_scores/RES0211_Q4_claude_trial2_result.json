    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and misrepresentations. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain responses about eczema, EpiPen use, and night sweats, when these are clearly present (D-9/P-9 for night sweats, D-21/P-21 for EpiPen, D-32/D-33/P-33 for eczema). It misattributes statements to [D-58] which is actually the doctor's summary, not screening questions. The answer also invents reasoning about differential diagnosis that is not explicitly present in the transcript. The Gold Answer correctly identifies multiple screening areas with accurate citations, while the Generated Answer covers only a fraction and does so inaccurately.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key screening conditions mentioned in the Gold Answer. It omits: night sweats screening and response, productive cough/sputum screening, severe allergic reaction screening (breathing difficulty/facial swelling), EpiPen confirmation, family history of asthma details, eczema screening in family, rashes/skin changes screening, GI symptoms screening, and joint pain screening. It only partially addresses asthma (personal history only) and makes vague references to medication history.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains multiple hallucinations and citation errors. It cites [D-58] as containing screening questions when this is actually a summary statement. It claims the transcript 'does not contain patient responses regarding these specific conditions' when they clearly do exist. The answer fabricates interpretive reasoning about 'differentiation from allergies' and 'exclusion of asthma' that goes beyond what is stated in the transcript. The clinical reasoning presented is plausible but not grounded in the actual transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question about systematic screening but does so incompletely and inaccurately. It focuses heavily on asthma and medication history while largely ignoring the other specific conditions mentioned in the question (eczema, EpiPen, night sweats). The added clinical reasoning about narrowing differential diagnosis, while medically sound, is not what the question asked for - it asked for what was screened and what the responses were, not interpretive analysis."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors, including incorrect claims that certain screenings are absent from the transcript and misattribution of citation sources. It covers less than 20% of the screening conditions identified in the Gold Answer, omitting night sweats, productive cough, severe allergic reactions, EpiPen status, family asthma history details, eczema, skin changes, GI symptoms, and joint pain. The answer includes hallucinated clinical reasoning not grounded in the transcript. While it attempts to address the question's focus on systematic screening, it does so incompletely and with poor accuracy, making it of limited clinical value for understanding the actual screening process documented in the encounter."
