  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as asthma and the specific negative findings (shortness of breath and wheezing) during physical activity. However, it incorrectly attributes the family history report to turn [P-13] (which discusses fevers) and incorrectly states it was reported by the patient, when the transcript indicates the mother provided this information in turn [P-28].",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all key points required by the prompt: the condition (asthma), the context of the ruling out (worked up), and the specific symptoms cited by the mother (shortness of breath, wheezing) especially during physical activity.",
    "faithfulness": "The citation [P-13] is a hallucination/error as that turn contains no mention of family history or asthma. The rest of the information is accurately grounded in turn [P-28].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question without unnecessary information."
