  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The main conclusion—anxiety/stress-related (non-cardiac) chest pain—is consistent with the Gold Answer. The situational pattern (worse when alone, better when distracted) and the presence of major academic stress support this. However, the Generated Answer contains a notable inaccuracy: it states the patient said the *pain* “has felt like that before” during anxiety episodes and cites [P-20], but in the transcript [P-20] refers to palpitations/heart flutter during past anxiety attacks, not chest pain. This weakens factual accuracy of the supporting evidence, though the overarching diagnosis remains correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) situational pattern/alone vs distracted [P-29]; (2) current stress load and stress as possible cause [P-13, P-8]; (3) anxiety-related physiologic response with faster breathing/difficulty deep breath due to nervousness [P-19].\nKey points missed from Gold Answer: explicit references to symptom relief when at school/talking to people [P-9] and occurrence while walking/studying [P-4] (only partially captured via [P-29]); the prior anxiety history details (teenage anxiety, discussed with doctor, untreated ~8 years, worried it may return) [P-21, P-22] were not accurately represented; and multiple pertinent negatives supporting anxiety over cardiopulmonary disease (no fever [P-12], not worse with exertion [P-10], occurs at rest [D-11, P-11], no palpitations outside anxiety [P-20], no asthma [P-23, P-24]).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (alone-with-thoughts trigger [P-29], distraction improves symptoms [P-29], stress/thesis pressure [P-13, P-15, P-16], stress considered as cause [P-8], nervous hyperventilation sensation [P-19]). However, it misattributes prior similar *chest pain* to anxiety and cites [P-20], which in context is about palpitations during anxiety, not chest pain. It also introduces a psychosomatic ‘mechanism’ statement not explicitly in the transcript (plausible but uncited).",
    "relevance": "Directly answers both parts of the question: provides the likely diagnosis (anxiety-induced/stress-related chest pain) and lists consultation observations supporting that inference, with minimal irrelevant material."
