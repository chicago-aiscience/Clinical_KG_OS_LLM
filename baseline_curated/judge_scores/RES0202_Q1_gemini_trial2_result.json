  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer (GA) is correct regarding the reported symptoms (cough, fever, fatigue, etc.). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the symptoms asked about and denied. The GA explicitly states that 'None of the specific symptoms from the examples provided (e.g., wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, GI complaints) were explicitly asked about by the doctor.' This directly contradicts the transcript where the doctor asks about wheezing [D-7], chest pain [D-13], sore throat [D-14], chills [D-19], and GI complaints [D-22, D-23].",
    "completeness": "The GA covers the first part of the question (reported symptoms) well, matching most points in the Gold Answer. However, it fails completely on the second part of the question. Because it wrongly claims these questions weren't asked, it misses all the 'pertinent negatives' listed in the Gold Answer (sputum, wheezing, chest pain, sore throat, chills, GI issues, etc.).",
    "faithfulness": "The GA's claim that the doctor did not ask about the specific symptoms mentioned in the prompt is a hallucination of absence. It ignores the entire segment of the transcript from [D-7] to [D-26] where the doctor conducts a review of systems. It also incorrectly attributes the denial of neurological symptoms to a broad statement in [P-32] rather than the specific responses in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The GA is highly relevant in structure, as it directly attempts to answer both parts of the multi-part question. However, the accuracy of the relevant content is poor in the second half."
