  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient tried 'decongestants' [P-10], matching the Gold Answer. The assessment of effectiveness as 'working a little bit' with nose still runny aligns closely with the Gold's description of it being ambiguous but noting it 'worked a little bit' due to transition from stuffy to runny [P-10]; no factual errors or contradictions. The doctor's OTC recommendation of 'Tylenol cold' [D-39] is correct, consistent with Gold. All facts fully match Gold and transcript.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) patient tried 'decongestants' [P-10] - covered; (2) assessment ambiguous/'worked a little bit'/reasoning stuffy to runny [P-10] - mostly covered but simplifies without full ambiguity nuance; (3) rec supportive care/hydrated/OTC 'Tylenol Cold' [D-39], viral takes weeks/not much beyond supportive - partially covered (Tylenol only, misses hydration, weeks, viral context). Covers core question elements (~85% of Gold's points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'decongestants' and 'worked a little bit'/runny nose in [P-10]; 'Tylenol cold' in [D-39]. Citations accurate, no unverifiable or hallucinated details; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question's three parts (med tried, assessment, OTC rec) in bullet-point structure with no off-topic content or tangents."
