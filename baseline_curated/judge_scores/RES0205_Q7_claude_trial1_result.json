  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains all the key factual information from the Gold Answer. The timeline is accurate: flu-like symptoms started 2 weeks ago, sore throat and runny nose lasted 2-3 days (first 3-4 days per patient), productive cough with whitish clear mucus for first 4-5 days, then transition to dry cough. The intensity remained stable throughout. All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses several details present in the Gold Answer: (1) explicit mention that sore throat lasted 2-3 days specifically (only mentions 3-4 days for all symptoms), (2) cough frequency of 3-4 times per hour, (3) spontaneous occurrence with no triggers, (4) no fevers at any point, (5) negative COVID test at onset, (6) patient has been home awaiting resolution. These are meaningful clinical details that affect completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The mucus description, timeline phases, and symptom progression are directly supported by patient statements. No hallucinated information is present. Citations to specific patient statements [P-2], [P-6], [P-14], etc. are accurate and appropriate.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about timeline progression, including initial symptoms, mucus production duration/appearance, transition to dry cough, symptom resolution, and cough characteristics. The response is well-organized chronologically and stays focused on the requested information without tangential content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-organized timeline of symptom progression that is fully faithful to the source transcript. All factual claims are correct and relevant to the question. However, it lacks several important details present in the Gold Answer, including specific timing of sore throat resolution (2-3 days), cough frequency quantification (3-4 times/hour), absence of triggers, lack of fever, and COVID test information. These omissions reduce completeness despite the response being factually sound and clinically useful."
