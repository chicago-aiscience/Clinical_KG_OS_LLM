  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript and Gold Answer that the only medication used is occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36], and that there are no prescribed medications involved [P-36]. It does not introduce incorrect facts.",
    "completeness": "It covers: (1) occasional OTC antihistamine/Reactine use for seasonal allergies, and (2) no prescribed medications. It misses a key Gold Answer point directly relevant to the question: for the current wheezing/SOB episodes, the mother does not give the child anything and episodes resolve with rest [P-33, P-34]. It also omits the Gold Answer’s note that she has no regular medications aside from occasional Reactine [P-46, P-47] and the past-viral-infections/no-antibiotics detail [P-16] (less central but still part of medication history).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made are supported by the transcript with appropriate references (Reactine/OTC use and no prescribed meds). No clear hallucinations or unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on medications/treatments and whether prescribed meds are part of management. However, it only partially addresses treatments for the current respiratory episodes (fails to state that nothing is given for them), which is part of the question."

  "summary": "Accurate and well-grounded regarding OTC Reactine and absence of prescriptions, but incomplete because it omits that no treatment/medication is given for the current wheezing episodes (and other minor medication-history details)."
