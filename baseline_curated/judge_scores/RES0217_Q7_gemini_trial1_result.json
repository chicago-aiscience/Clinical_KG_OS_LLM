  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns well with the gold answer and the transcript. It correctly identifies the activities (hiking, gardening), the location of the bite (behind the left knee), and the specific symptoms/engorgement levels for both current and prior episodes.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but misses a few specific details found in the gold answer: the location of the hiking (Strathroy) and the doctor's estimate that the tick had been attached for 'longer than at least 72 hours.' It does include the comparison of symptoms and engorgement as requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, using specific citations [P-1, P-3, D-5] to support its claims without hallucinating external information.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly and exclusively addresses the components of the question: the timeline of exposure/discovery and the comparison between episodes."
