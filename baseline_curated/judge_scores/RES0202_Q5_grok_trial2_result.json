  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the mother's suspicion that the child contracted COVID at school [P-2], symptom onset after returning from school on Wednesday [P-1], no known sick contacts outside of school [P-38], and uncertainty about school contacts ('hard to say') [P-38]. It correctly notes no school notification cited, aligning with [P-39]. Minor discrepancies include not explicitly quoting the school's lack of contact [P-39], omitting the school's COVID test requirement for return and informing others [P-41], and not mentioning no travel [P-40] or environmental issues [P-37] that Gold uses to narrow the source, but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: school as central suspected source [P-2, P-1]; no known sick contacts outside school [P-38]; hard to say for school [P-38]; no school notification [implied via P-38/P-39]. Missed: explicit school non-notification phrasing [P-39]; school policy requiring COVID test to inform other families [P-41]; no recent travel [D-40/P-40]; no home environmental exposures [D-37/P-37]. Covers ~80% of Gold's key points, focusing on core question elements.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-2, P-38, D-44]. Mother's desire for COVID test aligns with [P-41, P-2]; no fabricated details. Reference to 'knowledge graph' is not in transcript but does not introduce ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by breaking down school attendance's role in suspected illness source, contrasting mother's reports of sick contacts at school (uncertain) vs. outside (none), and noting lack of school notifications, with structured, focused response and no tangents."
