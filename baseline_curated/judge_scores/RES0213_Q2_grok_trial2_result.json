  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the three OTC medications (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) tried for chest pain from [P-6], matching the Gold Answer. It correctly states their ineffectiveness with a near-verbatim quote from [P-6] ('hasn't really helped very much'), aligning with Gold's description. The regular supplement (multi vitamin) from [P-25] is included precisely as in Gold. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: three OTC remedies for pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) [P-6]; ineffectiveness [P-6]; daily multivitamin as only regular supplement [P-25]; confirmation of no prescription meds implied in structure [D-25, P-25]. Gold's additional context on stress management and smoking (not meds/supplements) is omitted but not required by question focus, covering 100% of core med/supplement points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer, and ineffectiveness from [P-6]; multi vitamin from [P-25]. Citations accurate to transcript. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by categorizing OTC meds for pain, their effectiveness, and regular supplements with citations; no off-topic content or tangents."
