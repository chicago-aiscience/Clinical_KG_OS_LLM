  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several major factual errors. First, it completely omits 'difficulty breathing,' which was a primary concern for the patient (starting yesterday and worsening). Second, it states that cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, and chest pain were 'not mentioned' in the transcript, whereas the transcript shows the doctor specifically asking about each of these and the patient explicitly denying them [P-15 to P-18, P-23]. Third, it provides a contradictory description of the taste symptom, claiming the patient 'denied a loss of taste' while the transcript indicates a partial loss ('maybe taste a little bit').",
    "completeness": "The response is highly incomplete. It misses the most significant symptom (difficulty breathing) and fails to list almost all the explicitly denied symptoms requested by the prompt (cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, chest pain). It also omits details about the duration and progression of the symptoms provided in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source text. It claims that several symptoms were not mentioned when they were clearly discussed in the dialogue. This is a hallucination of absence. Furthermore, it mischaracterizes the patient's statement regarding the loss of taste.",
    "relevance": "While the generated answer attempts to follow the structure of the question, it fails to provide the relevant information requested. Specifically, the prompt asks which commonly screened symptoms the patient denied; the generated answer fails to list them, incorrectly asserting they were not in the transcript."
