  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly focuses on positive findings (difficulty breathing) to explain the differential diagnosis section, despite the prompt specifically asking for how 'negative findings' (denied symptoms) help. It also suggests that anosmia (loss of smell) is a primary symptom of the common cold used to differentiate it from COVID-19, which is medically counter-intuitive as anosmia is a hallmark of COVID-19. It misses nearly all the negative findings listed in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is highly incomplete. It only identifies one negative finding (loss of smell) out of at least ten mentioned in the Gold Answer (cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, prior breathing issues, sick contacts, and travel).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms mentioned in the transcript, but it fails to accurately represent the relationship between the findings and the diagnostic reasoning requested.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer spends a significant portion of the response discussing symptoms the patient *did* have (sore throat, difficulty breathing) rather than focusing on the symptoms the patient *denied* and how those specific negative findings influenced the differential diagnosis."
