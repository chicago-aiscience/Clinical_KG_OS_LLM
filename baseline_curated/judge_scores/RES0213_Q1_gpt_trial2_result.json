  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly captures key features: sharp/strong pain with deep breath (P-3), ~20-minute episodes (P-6), occurring when walking alone or studying (P-29), and less noticeable when engaged with others or hands-on tasks (P-9, P-29). However, it introduces a notable inaccuracy by implying the chest pain relates to “episodes involving an anxiety attack” and cites P-20 for that; P-20 discusses palpitations/heart flutter during anxiety attacks, not chest pain. It also somewhat overstates stress/anxiety as a trigger (“linked to stress and anxiety”), whereas the transcript shows the patient is unsure and only speculates it could be stress (P-8).",
    "completeness": "Includes: quality (sharp/strong, pleuritic with deep breath), episode duration (~20 minutes), occurs when alone walking/studying, improves/goes unnoticed when talking to others/doing tasks. Missing several Gold Answer elements: (1) symptom timeframe of ~1.5 weeks, (2) initial description as ‘uncomfortable/odd’ rather than pain, (3) intermittent recurrence ‘here and there’ throughout the day, (4) occurs at rest (explicitly confirmed), and (5) not worse with exercise/unchanged with walking and no strenuous exercise recently. Also omits ‘walking to school’/‘sitting and studying’ wording (though partially implied).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript, but there are two faithfulness issues: (1) the claim about non-occurrence “outside of episodes involving an anxiety attack” is not supported and misuses P-20, and (2) describing the pain as ‘linked to stress and anxiety’ goes beyond what is stated (patient speculation rather than confirmed trigger).",
    "relevance": "Largely addresses the asked characteristics (quality, duration, when it occurs vs resolves). The added discussion of nervousness/rapid breathing and father’s heart attack is somewhat tangential but still connected to the context of when symptoms occur/are noticed."

  "summary": "The answer captures the main pain quality, typical 20-minute episodes, and the pattern of occurring when alone and being less noticeable when distracted, but it omits several key Gold details and includes an unsupported anxiety-attack-related claim."
