  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is completely incorrect. It claims that the transcript contains only patient statements (P-1 through P-35) and no doctor statements, which is factually false. The provided transcript contains 38 turns, including several statements by the doctor (D-1 through D-38).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points from the Gold Answer because it incorrectly asserts that the information is missing from the source text. It fails to mention the consultation with the other doctor, the potential for tests, or the plan to return shortly.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not faithful to the provided transcript. It hallucinates that the transcript is incomplete and lacks doctor dialogue, when the dialogue is clearly present in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question. Instead of answering what next steps were communicated, it provides a summary of patient symptoms and incorrectly states that the doctor's communication is undocumented."
