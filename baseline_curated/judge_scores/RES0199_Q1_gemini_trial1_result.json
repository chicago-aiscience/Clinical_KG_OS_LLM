  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the availability of information in the transcript. It states that the frequency of diarrhea is not provided, whereas the patient explicitly states 'five or six times a day' in [P-28]. Furthermore, for the headache severity, it provides a qualitative description ('pretty persistent') instead of the numeric rating of '7' explicitly mentioned in [P-8].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include several specific details requested by the prompt. It missed the frequency of diarrhea episodes and the numerical severity rating of the headache. It also omitted clinical details present in the Gold Answer such as the lack of blood in stool/vomitus, the 'liquid' nature of stools, and the 'food contents' description of the vomit.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes an inaccurate claim about the source material by stating that the frequency of diarrhea is not mentioned. This is a form of hallucination/omission of a clear fact present in the text (P-28).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to address every specific component of the multi-part question, although it fails to provide the correct information for two of those components."
