  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the Gold Answer: (1) planned quick physical exam, (2) sending the tick for lab species identification, (3) sending blood work for Lyme titres/serology, (4) starting prophylactic antibiotics due to likely >72h attachment and geographic risk, (5) consulting/speaking with another physician, and (6) preventive advice about tick habitats and using insecticide. Minor inaccuracies/additions: it states the physical exam would assess “other potential exposures,” which is not explicitly stated as part of the exam in the transcript; and it implies the patient was advised to continue the statin—this was discussed in history but not included as part of the end-of-visit plan in the transcript/Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: quick physical exam; tick sent to local lab for identification; blood work for Lyme titres/serology; prophylactic antibiotics with no specific drug/dose/duration stated; planned discussion with/assessment by a physician; prevention advice re: long grass/wood-field edges, tick behavior, and possible insecticide. No major Gold Answer elements are missing. The only extra content is the statin continuation, which is not part of the Gold plan.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (D-6, D-13, D-18, D-22). However, the answer introduces at least one plan element not supported by the transcript: advising continuation of the statin. Also, “assess other potential exposures” as part of the physical exam is not directly supported. These are minor but represent some ungrounded elaboration.",
    "relevance": "The response is strongly focused on the requested clinical plan (tests, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice). The inclusion of cholesterol/statin continuation is a minor tangent not asked for and not part of the documented plan."
