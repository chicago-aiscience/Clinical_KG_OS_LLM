  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies decongestants as the medication tried, accurately captures the patient's assessment ('working a little bit'), and correctly identifies Tylenol Cold as the recommended OTC treatment. All core facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main components required: prior medication, effectiveness assessment, and doctor's recommendation. However, it lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the patient's reasoning about the nose transitioning from stuffy to runny (showing why they thought it 'worked a little bit'), the broader supportive care recommendations (staying hydrated), and the timeline expectations (few weeks for resolution). Covers approximately 75% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer quotes P-10 for prior medication and assessment, and D-39 for the doctor's recommendation. No hallucinated content or unverifiable claims present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what medication was tried, the patient's assessment, and the doctor's recommendation. The response is focused and contains no irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately addresses all three components of the question with factually correct information grounded in the transcript. It correctly identifies decongestants as the prior medication, captures the patient's 'worked a little bit' assessment, and accurately notes Tylenol Cold as the recommended OTC treatment. While missing some contextual details present in the Gold Answer (patient's reasoning about symptom transition, hydration advice, timeline expectations), the core facts are complete and accurate. The answer demonstrates excellent faithfulness to source material and perfect relevance to the question asked."
