{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct and aligns with the transcript and gold answer regarding the patient's cough, breathing difficulties, wheezing, and the frequency of symptoms. It accurately quotes the patient's descriptions.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points present in the gold answer. Specifically, it fails to mention 'chest sensations' (chest tightness), which was explicitly requested in the prompt. It also omits the two-week duration of the cough, the fact that the cough is non-productive (no gunk), and the detail that wheezing occurs more frequently than bronchodilator use.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, providing accurate citations for all claims and avoiding any hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly relevant but fails to address the specific part of the prompt requesting information on 'chest sensations.' Otherwise, it remains focused on the clinical questions asked."
