  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as anxiety-induced chest pain, aligning with the Gold Answer's 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' Core supporting facts like situational triggers, distraction relief, stress, breathing linked to nervousness, and patient's suspicion of stress are accurate. Minor discrepancies include using P-20 for history of anxiety (which discusses palpitations, not chest pain directly; Gold uses P-21/P-22) and omitting pertinent negatives, but no major factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: situational pattern (alone walking/studying, resolves with distraction; partial via P-29, Gold has P-4/P-9/P-29), history of anxiety (partial/mis-cited), current stress (partial via P-13 school/smoking; Gold specifies thesis P-15/P-16), nervous breathing (P-19), patient considers stress (P-8). Missed: detailed stress from thesis deadline, all pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional, rest pain, no palps outside anxiety, no asthma). Covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are grounded in transcript with accurate citations except minor issues: P-20 misattributed to chest pain history (actually palpitations in anxiety); P-19 slightly overstated as 'hard time breathing' (transcript clarifies not otherwise). No major hallucinations; psychosomatic mechanism is inferred but plausible. Citations verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by stating diagnosis and listing specific supporting observations with transcript citations; no off-topic content."
