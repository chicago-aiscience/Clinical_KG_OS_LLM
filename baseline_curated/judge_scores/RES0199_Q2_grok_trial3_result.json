  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the home medication for headache relief, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-3, P-4]. It accurately describes the headache location from [P-5], though cites [P-5] incorrectly for Tylenol usage (actual usage in [P-3, P-4]). Doctor's recommendations for hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, and Tylenol for aches are correct, but omits NSAIDs option, COVID test, isolation, patient's prior hydration efforts [P-30], and explicit note of no prescriptions. Core facts align, with minor discrepancies in omissions and citation.",
    "completeness": "Covered: Tylenol for headache; doctor's supportive measures (hydration, nutritious food, sleep); Tylenol for fever and aches. Missed: precise citations [P-3/P-4]; patient's self-hydration [P-30]; NSAIDs alongside Tylenol; no prescription meds; COVID swab and 14-day isolation [D-52]. Covers ~85% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript: Tylenol usage [P-3/P-4], location [P-5], doctor's plan verbatim from [D-52]. Minor issue: [P-5] citation inaccurate for Tylenol (usage elsewhere). No 'NSAIDs' but doesn't fabricate; omits but doesn't contradict. 'Adequate sleep' paraphrases 'sleeping well'. Citations mostly accurate, no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response to question: patient's medication/symptom, then doctor's plan with bullet points. No tangents or off-topic content."
