  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold answer: patient tried nothing OTC/self-care; takes no regular meds; doctor recommended COVID swab test; results may take 1–2 days; self-isolate until results and longer if symptomatic; may need other tests and will review with supervising physician.\n\nGenerated answer correctly identifies the main points: no self-treatment tried and COVID swab + self-isolation instructions. However, it introduces alcohol and edible use under “Self-Treatments/History,” which is not a treatment for the presenting symptoms and could be misleading in the context of the question (though it is mentioned in the transcript). It also omits the explicit “No, I haven’t tried anything” phrasing and the “no regular medications” confirmation, and it does not mention the expected turnaround time for results.",
    "completeness": "Included: (1) patient did not try anything for symptoms (in general terms), (2) doctor recommended COVID swab, (3) self-isolation until results and longer if symptoms persist.\n\nMissed from gold: (1) explicit note that patient confirmed no regular medications, (2) results may take a day or two, (3) mention of possible additional tests and plan to review with supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "All stated items are traceable to the transcript: the patient’s lack of trying anything is supported by P-9; the swab and isolation instructions are supported by D-39. Alcohol/edibles are mentioned in P-33/P-34, but their inclusion as part of “self-treatments” is not grounded in the transcript as being related to symptom management and is contextually misleading rather than fabricated.",
    "relevance": "The answer mostly addresses what was tried before the visit and what the doctor recommended. The alcohol/edibles detail is a minor tangent and not responsive to the medication/treatment question."

  "summary": "The generated answer captures the core plan (no self-treatment, COVID swab, isolate) but omits several gold details (no regular meds, result timing, possible further tests) and includes a mildly misleading tangent about alcohol/edibles."
