  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All stated elements match the Gold Answer and transcript: she takes multivitamins [P-40], reports a penicillin allergy [P-37], and the reaction is a rash [P-38]. No incorrect or contradictory information is introduced.",
    "completeness": "Covers the core items requested and present in the Gold Answer: current regimen (multivitamins only), drug allergy (penicillin), and adverse reaction (rash). It does not include the Gold Answer’s additional clarification that she has no trouble breathing with the reaction [P-39] and does not explicitly state she is on no prescription medications (though this is implied by “multivitamins”).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript with appropriate bracketed citations. No hallucinated medications, allergies, or reactions.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question (med regimen, allergy, and specific reaction) without unrelated content."
