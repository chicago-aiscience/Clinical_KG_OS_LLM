  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the management plan stated in the transcript and Gold Answer: COVID-19 swab ordered, isolate for 14 days, contact tracing if positive, and supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). No contradictions or incorrect additions are present.",
    "completeness": "It covers all elements explicitly asked in the question (test ordered, 14-day isolation duration, contact tracing condition, and supportive care recommendations). However, compared with the Gold Answer’s “complete management plan,” it omits two additional points included there: expected test turnaround time (24–48 hours) and the clinician’s note about an alternative diagnosis if COVID-negative (another viral illness).",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by [D-52]. The answer does not introduce new, unsupported recommendations or details.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested management-plan components and does not include irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate, well-grounded, and directly responsive, but it is slightly less complete than the Gold Answer because it omits the stated 24–48 hour turnaround time and the mention of an alternative viral illness if the swab is negative."
