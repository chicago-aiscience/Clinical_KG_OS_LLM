  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and correctly states timing for each (cough ~4–5 days; runny nose past couple of days). However, it contains major factual errors by stating the transcript does not specify whether the cough is productive vs. non-productive and does not describe the nasal discharge appearance. In the transcript, the cough is explicitly described as dry and non-productive (denies bringing up any “gunk”), and the nasal discharge is described as “pretty clear.” It also omits that the cough stayed the same (neither worse nor better). Because the question specifically asks for these characteristics, these errors are significant.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer that are missing: (1) cough characterized as dry; (2) explicitly non-productive/no sputum; (3) cough has stayed the same since onset; (4) nasal discharge described as clear; (5) additional context/negatives mentioned in the Gold (no sore throat, no chest pain, no wheeze/SOB). The Generated Answer includes only the presence and duration of cough and runny nose, so it covers well under half of the required details.",
    "faithfulness": "While the answer’s included statements about duration are grounded in the transcript, it makes multiple unfaithful claims by asserting that the transcript lacks information on cough productivity and nasal discharge appearance—details that are clearly present. These are not just omissions; they directly contradict the transcript content, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked respiratory symptoms (cough and runny nose) and attempts to address characteristics. There is no major off-topic content, though it fails to provide the specific characteristics requested."
