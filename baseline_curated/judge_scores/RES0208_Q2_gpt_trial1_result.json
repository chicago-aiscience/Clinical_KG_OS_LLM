  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that the patient currently uses Tums for reflux and that he stopped his prior reflux medication after identifying dietary triggers that controlled symptoms (matches [P-27]). However, it omits the other current medication (Avodart) and its indication (BPH), which makes the overall medication list inaccurate/incomplete compared with the Gold Answer. It also labels the prior reflux medication as “prescription,” which is not explicitly stated in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Tums used PRN for reflux; (2) he discontinued prior reflux medication because dietary modification helped. Key points missed: (1) Avodart (dutasteride) as a current medication; (2) Avodart’s indication—enlarged prostate/BPH; (3) denial of allergies (included in Gold Answer). Overall this is roughly about half of the required content.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in [P-27]. However, the citation “[Knowledge Graph]” is not part of the transcript, and “previous prescription medication” is an inference (the patient only said “a medication”). No other clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the medications and the patient’s independent change to his reflux regimen, which directly addresses the question. It is partially responsive because it omits one of the patient’s current medications and its indication."
