  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains major factual errors. It claims that the transcript does not contain information regarding recent travel, which is incorrect; the patient explicitly mentions traveling to Sarnia [P-23]. It also claims the negative response to weight loss is not detailed, but the patient explicitly says 'No, not really' [P-22]. It also states that the chemical exposure response 'maintains' the differential, whereas the Gold Answer (and transcript [P-34]) suggests it makes it less likely because the patient is on the engineering side and not directly exposed.",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the general types of diseases being screened for (occupational lung disease, TB/cancer, travel-associated diseases, contagious infections). however, it misses the specific details from the patient's responses (Sarnia, the engineering role) that the Gold Answer uses to narrow the differential.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer suffers from significant 'hallucinations of omission.' It claims information is missing from the transcript (travel and weight loss) that is clearly present in the text provided. This shows a lack of grounding in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is structured correctly to address the prompt's requirements, but the content provided is largely invalid due to the errors mentioned above."
