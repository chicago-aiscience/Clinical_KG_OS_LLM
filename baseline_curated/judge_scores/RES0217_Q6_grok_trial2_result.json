  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the Gold Answer: diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick to lab, blood work for serology), prophylactic antibiotics with correct rationale (>72 hours attachment), physician consultation, and preventive advice (ticks in long grass/woods-fields, insecticide). Minor accurate details like deer tick reference from [D-5]. However, it introduces a factual error by including 'Medication for Cholesterol: Implicitly, the patient was advised to continue taking their statin' as part of the clinical plan, which is not mentioned in the Gold Answer or as a proposed action in the doctor's end-of-consultation plan (only historical note in [D-14-16]). This is a significant extraneous addition not part of the tick bite plan.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: all three diagnostic tests (physical exam [D-18], tick lab ID [D-6,D-18], blood serology [D-18]); prophylactic antibiotics with >72h and intent to start [D-6,D-13,D-18]; physician consultation/talk to doctor [D-13,D-18,D-22]; preventive advice on ticks' habitat, waving legs (implied in inspection), and insecticide for garden [D-18]. Geographic risk [D-13] implied but not explicitly listed. Extra cholesterol point not in Gold. Covers 90-95% precisely, with full diagnostic/treatment/consult/prevention structure.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: citations [D-5,D-6,D-18] accurate for tick ID, serology, physical exam, antibiotics, preventive advice. Prophylactic rationale grounded in [D-6] 72h and [D-18]. Physician talk [D-18,D-22]. However, minor hallucinations: 'knowledge graph' not in transcript; cholesterol 'advised to continue' not stated (only noted); physical exam to 'assess other potential exposures [D-18]' – D-18 only says 'quick physical exam', exposures covered earlier verbally; no waving legs in preventive verbatim but implied in description. Mostly grounded with minor additions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to match question categories (diagnostic tests lab/physical, treatments, physician consultation, preventive advice on garden/outdoors). Directly addresses comprehensive plan at end of consultation. Single irrelevant cholesterol addition is a minor tangent in treatments section."
