    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually correct. It accurately states that the patient had not tried any specific treatments for their symptoms and correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test and self-isolation instructions recommended by the doctor. It does not contain any false information.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary points (no treatments tried, COVID-19 test, isolation instructions). However, it misses several specific details present in the Gold Answer: the fact that the patient takes no regular medications, the expected timeframe for test results (1-2 days), the possibility of further tests, and the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is faithful to the transcript. The inclusion of alcohol and edibles is supported by the text, although they are miscategorized as treatments or medications tried for the current illness.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant. However, the question asks for medications or treatments the patient tried 'on their own' (implying for the illness), while the generated answer includes social history (alcohol/edibles) that were not used as treatments, which is slightly off-topic for the specific query regarding interventions for the current symptoms. It focuses well on the doctor's recommendations otherwise. (The Gold Answer is much more precise on this).', 'faithfulness': '5', 'relevance': '4'}"
