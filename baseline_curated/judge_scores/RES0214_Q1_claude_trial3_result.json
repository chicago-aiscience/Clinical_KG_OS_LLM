  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies 3 of the 4 symptoms (fever, sore throat, stuffy nose) but makes a critical error regarding the denials. The transcript clearly shows explicit denials for all five symptoms mentioned in the question: cough [P-10], headache [P-8], neck stiffness [P-7], nausea [P-5], and difficulty swallowing [P-24, P-25, P-26]. The claim that 'the patient's specific transcript responses focus solely on confirming symptoms' and that 'specific denials cannot be verified' is factually incorrect and contradicts the transcript evidence.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the four reported symptoms adequately (though it lists muscle ache which wasn't emphasized as prominently in Gold Answer). However, it completely fails to address the second part of the question about denied symptoms, claiming they cannot be verified when they are explicitly documented in the transcript. This represents a major omission of approximately 50% of the required content.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is partially faithful to the transcript for the reported symptoms section. However, the claim that denials 'cannot be verified' based on the provided text is a significant error, as the transcript clearly contains these denials ([P-5], [P-7], [P-8], [P-10], [P-24-P-26]). This suggests the evaluator either didn't review the full transcript or misinterpreted it.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the first part of the question about reported symptoms. However, it fails to properly address the second part about denied symptoms, instead deflecting by claiming insufficient information when the information is clearly present in the transcript."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies three of the four reported symptoms but makes a critical error in the denials section. It incorrectly claims that the patient's explicit denials of cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing 'cannot be verified' when these denials are clearly documented in the transcript at [P-5], [P-7], [P-8], [P-10], and [P-24-P-26]. This represents a significant factual error and incomplete coverage of the question requirements."
