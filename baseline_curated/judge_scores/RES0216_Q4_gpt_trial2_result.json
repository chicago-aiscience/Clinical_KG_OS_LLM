  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies the deprioritized diagnosis as a “cardiac ischemic picture/cardiac ischemia,” consistent with D-36.\n- Correctly notes the clinician’s reasoning that symptoms were more “tightness” than “pain” and that there wasn’t classic exertional shortness of breath (D-36; supported by patient denying pain at P-5).\n- However, it overstates the inference by saying these findings “rule out” cardiac ischemia; the transcript supports “lower on the differential,” not exclusion.\n- It also fails to incorporate other symptom-based evidence explicitly referenced in the encounter (e.g., screened-and-denied autonomic/panic-like red flags).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered:\n- Condition placed lower: cardiac ischemic picture (covered).\n- Chest complaint characterized as tightness rather than pain (covered).\n- Lack of classic exertional dyspnea emphasized by clinician (mostly covered).\n\nKey Gold Answer points missed:\n- Pertinent negatives: denial of anxiety, sweating, and feeling of impending doom (P-6) that the clinician specifically screened for (D-6).\n- The Gold Answer’s framing that the clinician used a combination of symptom quality + absence of associated red flags to lower ischemia likelihood (partially captured, but missing major elements).",
    "faithfulness": "- Most claims are grounded in D-36 and P-5/P-1.\n- The statement “This conclusion is supported by the Knowledge Graph…” is not supported by the provided transcript and introduces an external, unverifiable element.\n- The phrasing “rule out cardiac ischemia” is not faithful to the clinician’s stated level of certainty (they lowered it on the differential rather than ruling it out).",
    "relevance": "- Directly answers what condition was lowered on the differential and cites symptom features used as justification.\n- Minor irrelevant/unsupported add-on about a “Knowledge Graph,” but overall remains focused on the asked content."

  "summary": "The answer correctly identifies cardiac ischemia and cites tightness without pain and lack of classic exertional dyspnea, but it omits key screened-and-denied red-flag symptoms (anxiety/sweating/impending doom) and includes an ungrounded “Knowledge Graph/rule out” claim."
