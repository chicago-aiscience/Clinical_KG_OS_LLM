  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient took Tylenol (acetaminophen) at home and that it was used for headache relief. It also correctly lists supportive measures (hydration, nutritious food, sleep) and the doctor’s recommendation to use Tylenol for fever if it develops. However, it is slightly inaccurate/overly restrictive in implying Tylenol alone for myalgias/arthralgias, whereas the clinician recommended “Tylenol or NSAIDs.” It also omits the COVID swab/isolation instructions (not incorrect, but missing).",
    "completeness": "Covered key points: Tylenol taken at home; symptom targeted = headache; supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep); Tylenol as antipyretic.\nMissed key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the option to use NSAIDs for muscle/joint aches, (2) COVID-19 swab testing, (3) isolation for 14 days while awaiting results (and related public health/contact tracing mention), and (4) patient’s self-initiated hydration effort prior to visit.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript (Tylenol use for headache; supportive care recommendations; Tylenol for fever). The only issue is citation specificity: it attributes Tylenol use to [P-5], which discusses headache location rather than Tylenol use (which appears in [P-3]/[P-4]). No clear hallucinated medications or measures.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the asked elements (home medication + targeted symptom + recommended medications/supportive measures). It does not add irrelevant content, though it omits some management-plan components (testing/isolation)."
