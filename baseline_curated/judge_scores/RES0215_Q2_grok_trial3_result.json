  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine as occasional OTC for seasonal allergies with accurate citations [P-35, P-36] and confirms no prescribed medications [P-36], consistent with Gold. Minor discrepancies: attributes statements to 'the patient' (actually the mother/parent P), references non-existent 'knowledge graph', and omits no treatment for current episodes or past no antibiotics; core facts match Gold.",
    "completeness": "Covers: occasional OTC Reactine for allergies, no prescribed meds (key points from Gold). Misses: no medications/treatments for current respiratory episodes (resolves on own [P-33,P-34]), past viral infections required no antibiotics [P-16]. Covers ~50-60% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine, seasonal allergies, and no prescribed meds are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-35,P-36]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: reference to 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript); misattributes speech to 'patient' instead of parent (P). Mostly grounded with some issues.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications for other conditions (allergies) and confirms no prescribed meds, but omits coverage of current respiratory episodes (no meds given). Mostly relevant to question with no off-topic content."
