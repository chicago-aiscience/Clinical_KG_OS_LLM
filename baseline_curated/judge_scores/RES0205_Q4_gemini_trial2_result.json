{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19) and the test (covid test). However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly mention the timing relative to symptom onset. Transcript [P-36] explicitly states the test was done 'when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago'.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific job role (hospital clerk), the mention of PPE usage, and the patient's desire to return to work once the cough subsides. Most importantly, it fails to provide the timing information requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the transcript does not state the timing of the test is a failure of grounding, as the information is present in [P-36]. By stating the information is missing, the model fails to faithfully represent the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each component of the multi-part question, although its answer for the timing component is incorrect."
