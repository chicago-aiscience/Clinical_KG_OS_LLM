  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four symptoms (fever, sore throat, stuffy nose, muscle ache) matching the Gold Answer with accurate citations. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain explicit denials of cough [P-10], headache [P-8], neck stiffness [P-7], nausea [P-5], and difficulty swallowing [P-24-P-26], directly contradicting the Gold Answer and the full transcript provided. This is a significant factual error.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: four symptoms (stuffy nose, sore throat, fever, muscle aches) - fully covered; explicit denials of cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea/vomiting, difficulty swallowing - completely missed (0%); additional details like no joint pain or temporal alignment partially echoed but not fully. Covers ~50% of core key points (symptoms yes, denials no).",
    "faithfulness": "Symptoms claims are verifiable with correct citations [P-1, P-13]. Denial claims ('do not contain... cannot be verified') are not grounded in the transcript, as all specified denials are explicitly present (e.g., [P-5], [P-7], [P-8], [P-10], [P-24-P-26]); this hallucinates an absence, with multiple unverifiable false statements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the question's two parts (reported symptoms and specific denials), uses bold headings, citations, and clinical tone; minor issue is incorrect content on denials but no off-topic tangents."
