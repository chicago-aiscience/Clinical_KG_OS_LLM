  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains mostly accurate information from the transcript. It correctly identifies the sharp pain quality with deep breathing [P-3], the 20-minute duration [P-6], and the situations of occurrence/resolution [P-29]. However, it contains a factual error by stating the patient 'attributes the pain to feelings of nervousness' when actually the patient says nervousness makes them breathe faster but doesn't attribute the pain itself to nervousness [P-19]. The Generated Answer also omits the initial description of 'very uncomfortable' and 'odd' feeling [P-2] that was present for a week and a half before becoming sharp pain.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer but misses several important details: (1) the initial 'uncomfortable' and 'odd' sensation description before it became sharp pain, (2) the intermittent nature ('here and there') versus constant pain, (3) the specific mention of sitting while studying in addition to walking, (4) the doctor's confirmation that pain occurs at rest [D-11, P-11], (5) no worsening with exercise [P-10], (6) no preceding injury [P-5], and (7) no prior occurrence before this episode [P-17]. It covers approximately 60-70% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is largely faithful to the transcript with one significant issue: it incorrectly interprets [P-19] by suggesting the patient attributes the chest pain to nervousness, when the patient actually says nervousness makes them breathe faster as a response to the pain, not that nervousness causes the pain. The statement about the father's heart attack is accurately cited [P-8]. The descriptions of when pain occurs and resolves are properly grounded in [P-29]. The sharp pain with deep breathing is accurately cited from [P-3], and the 20-minute duration from [P-6].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by organizing information into the requested categories: quality, duration, and situations of occurrence versus resolution. All content provided is relevant to answering the specific question asked. The structure matches what was requested, making it highly focused and on-topic."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a well-structured response that addresses the question's components (quality, duration, situations) and is highly relevant. However, it has moderate issues with correctness (misinterpreting P-19 regarding nervousness), completeness (missing ~40% of key details from Gold Answer including initial symptom description, rest occurrence, no worsening with exercise, no injury, and first-time occurrence), and faithfulness (one significant misinterpretation of the nervousness-pain relationship). The answer covers core facts correctly but lacks the comprehensive detail and nuance present in the Gold Answer."
