  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition as asthma and lists the correct negative symptoms (shortness of breath and wheezing) associated with physical activity. It also correctly notes the patient was 'worked up' for the condition. However, it incorrectly attributes the family history report to the patient in turn [P-13]. In the transcript, [P-13] discusses fevers, and the family history is discussed in [P-28] by the mother.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the core components of the question (condition, symptoms, and activity context). It misses the specific detail about the grandparents (though mentioned in the prompt) and the patient's general health status mentioned in the Gold Answer (e.g., that he had never had a dry cough like this before), which served as further evidence for ruling out asthma.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a hallucination regarding the content of turn [P-13], claiming it contains the family history report when it actually contains information about the patient's fever history. The attribution of this report to the patient instead of the mother is also a minor faithfulness issue given the context of the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's requirements without unnecessary information."
