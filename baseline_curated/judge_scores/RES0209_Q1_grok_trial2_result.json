  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the dry cough (nonstop daytime), shortness of breath, and frequent wheezing from the transcript and Gold Answer, with correct citations. However, it omits chest tightness (D-20, P-20), cough duration of two weeks (P-13), detailed breathing difficulty ('hard time breathing', P-19), and wheezing frequency exceeding bronchodilator use (D-17, P-17). These are minor to moderate discrepancies, but core symptoms and frequencies align well with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: dry cough details and daytime persistence (partial, misses 2-week duration and 'no gunk' confirmation), breathing difficulties (partial, only 'short of breath', misses 'hard time breathing'), wheezing ('a lot'), frequency differences (day prominent, night less frequent/every other day). Missed entirely: chest tightness, full breathing episode details, wheezing more than reliever use. Covers ~70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (P-1 for cough/SOB/daytime, P-15 for wheezing, P-18 for nighttime frequency). Specifies 'nighttime symptoms, specifically wheezing' which aligns with context (discussion of wheezing/cough before P-18). No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around reported symptoms (cough character, breathing, wheezing) and day/night frequency differences, precisely matching the question's focus, with no off-topic content."
