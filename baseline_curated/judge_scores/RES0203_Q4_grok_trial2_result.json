  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies some negative findings like no fever (P-10), no headaches (P-12), no chest pain (P-22), but introduces factual errors by claiming no explicit denial of difficulty breathing/dyspnea (explicitly denied in P-11 'No') and sore throat (explicitly denied in P-13 'No'); it uses vague 'likely absent' for chills/night sweats (P-14 'No') and muscle aches/weakness (P-15 'Uh no'), misses key negatives like no sputum/blood (P-7), no cough triggers (P-21), and the D-16 summary; explanation has similarities but adds unsubstantiated COVID 'knowledge graph'; significant errors and omissions compared to Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 9 ROS negatives (fever, dyspnea, headaches, sore throat, chills/night sweats, muscle aches/weakness, chest pain, sputum/blood, cough triggers), D-16 summary, no chronic conditions/meds/surgeries/allergies/family history, and explanation of clinical implications. Generated covers fever, headaches, chest pain, sore throat (partially), chills/muscle (vaguely), chronic conditions/allergies (~50-60%), misses dyspnea explicit, sputum, triggers, D-16, some history, partial explanation; covers 50-79%.",
    "faithfulness": "Some claims verifiable (fever P-10, headaches P-12, chest pain P-22, chronic D-23/P-23, allergies P-26), but multiple inaccuracies/hallucinations: dyspnea not explicit (false, P-11), sore throat not explicit (false, P-13), 'likely absent' for explicit denials (P-14, P-15), 'knowledge graph' and inferences like 'lack of reported sweating' not in transcript; cough as suggesting no distress plausible but stretched; multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists negative findings from ROS and explains clinical significance (e.g., no distress, differentiates infections), addresses question core (symptoms absent like fever/dyspnea/sore throat informing picture), minor tangents like knowledge graph but mostly focused."
