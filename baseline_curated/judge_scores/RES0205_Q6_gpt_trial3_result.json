  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated plan in the transcript: (1) a quick listen to heart and lungs, (2) a quick physical exam, (3) then consulting the doctor they are working with, reviewing what was discussed, and returning to the patient to discuss next steps. These elements align with [D-37] and do not contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core end-of-visit plan components from the Gold Answer (heart/lung auscultation, quick physical exam, consult supervising doctor, review discussion, return to discuss next steps). It omits additional contextual points included in the Gold Answer: that this structure was foreshadowed at the start ([D-1]), that the patient agreed ([P-37]), and the explicit note that no diagnosis/medication was provided and the transcript ends before findings/treatment. Thus it is mostly complete but not fully comprehensive relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically [D-37]. No added, unverifiable, or hallucinated details are present.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on what the question asks: the plan at the end, the specified exam components, and the process for determining next steps. No irrelevant tangents."
