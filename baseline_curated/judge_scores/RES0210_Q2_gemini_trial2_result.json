  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Lipitor for cholesterol. However, it incorrectly states that no over-the-counter (OTC) medications were mentioned, whereas the Gold Answer and transcript [P-14] identify Tylenol. Consequently, the Generated Answer fails to provide the effectiveness of the OTC medication, contradicting the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a significant portion of the Gold Answer. It omits the identification of Tylenol, its purpose (symptom relief/fever), and its reported effectiveness ('helps a little bit'). It covers about 50% of the requested medication information.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript does not mention any OTC medications. This is a failure to ground the answer in the provided text, as [P-14] explicitly mentions Tylenol. While the transcript contains a likely typo ('haven't' instead of 'have'), the context 'and that helps a little bit' indicates use, which the Gold Answer correctly captures and the Generated Answer ignores.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in terms of structure, directly addressing each part of the prompt (Prescribed, OTC, Effectiveness), even though it provides incorrect 'Not applicable' conclusions for the latter sections."
