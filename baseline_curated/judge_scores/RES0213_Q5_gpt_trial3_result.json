  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns with the Gold Answer on the central causal framing: father’s MI in his 50s heightens perceived cardiac risk; smoking history contributes to worry as a modifiable cardiac risk factor; and current stress/anxiety can both provoke symptoms and increase vigilance/interpretation of symptoms as cardiac.\n\nHowever, it contains a notable factual discrepancy: it states “the transcript does not confirm current active smoking,” but the patient explicitly reports she is still smoking (cut down to ~5/day; previously ~10/day) and is “trying to quit” [P-14, P-18]. It also introduces non-transcript concepts (“knowledge graph,” “diagnosis”) that are not part of the consultation record. These issues prevent a perfect score, though the core facts remain mostly correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points covered:\n- Father had a heart attack last year in his 50s; patient explicitly scared/worried chest pain is a “heart thing” [P-8] (covered).\n- Smoking contributes; quitting is hard amid school stress [P-13] (covered).\n- Stress from Masters/thesis time crunch [P-15, P-16] (covered).\n- Anxiety-type physiology/interpretation: nervousness and faster breathing during episodes; anxiety attacks may be returning; symptoms noticed more when alone/studying [P-19, P-22, P-29] (mostly covered).\n\nKey Gold details missing or under-specified:\n- Father now sees “a lot of heart doctors” [P-30] (missing).\n- Smoking trajectory details (started ~18, ~10/day for 2 years, cut down to ~5/day) [P-14, P-18] (partially mentioned but not specified accurately/fully).\n- Living alone/limited social contact in London [P-26, P-27] (missing).\n- Nervous about running lately [P-28] (missing).\n- Paternal grandfather history unknown because he died young in an accident [P-30] (missing).\n\nOverall, it captures the main structure but omits several illustrative consultation details highlighted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded in the transcript:\n- References to a “knowledge graph” and a “heart disease concern diagnosis” are not in the provided consultation.\n- The claim that active smoking is not confirmed contradicts patient statements [P-14, P-18].\n\nMost other claims (father’s MI, fear, school stress, symptoms more noticeable when alone, anxiety-related breathing changes) are supported by cited transcript segments. Because there are multiple non-transcript additions and one contradictory claim, faithfulness is moderate rather than high.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with the patient’s heart-disease concern, and it cites transcript examples (e.g., [P-8], [P-13], [P-19], [P-29]). Minor irrelevant framing (“knowledge graph/diagnosis”) slightly detracts but does not derail the answer."
