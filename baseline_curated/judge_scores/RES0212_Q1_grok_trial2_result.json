  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has some factual inaccuracies compared to the Gold Answer: cough duration is understated as 'at least a month' instead of approximately three months [P-2]; misses initial dry, intermittent, recurrent nature and onset during pole dancing [P-2, P-13]; sputum misses explicit no blood [P-10] and no foul smell noticed [P-11]; includes eczema as an associated symptom, which is a past history not related to the current respiratory complaint; cough pain is correctly noted but Gold specifies 'discomfort only when coughing'; denials are incomplete and only partially match (body pain ok, blood ok but cited wrongly); misses exercise impairment [P-47]. Core respiratory symptoms like recent productive greenish sputum and sleep disruption are correct, but significant omissions and errors in details.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: chronic cough (partial), recent productive greenish gross sputum (partial), cough pain/discomfort, sleep disturbance/fatigue (partial), subjective fever. Missed: exact 3-month duration, initial dry/intermittent/recurrent characteristics, onset at pole dancing, sputum no blood/no foul smell, nightly awakening specifics last month, exercise impairment, most denied symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, loose clothes, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, body pain fully contextualized, sick contacts). Covers approximately 40-50% of key points, especially weak on denials and cough history details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are verifiable in transcript: cough worsening and gross gunk [P-2, P-12], greenish sputum [P-9], cough pain [P-3], sleep disruption [P-19-21], fever [P-4], fatigue [P-19], eczema [P-22-23], no body pain [P-19], no blood [P-10 though cited D-47]. Minor issues: 'more frequent' not explicitly stated (plausible from context); cough duration 'at least a month' from P-19 (sleep context) but total 3 months in P-2; D-47 citation is doctor's summary not patient denial. No major hallucinations, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum characteristics), associated symptoms (sleep, fever, fatigue, pain), and denied symptoms with structured format matching question. Minor tangent: includes eczema history, which is not a current respiratory/associated symptom for this consultation."
