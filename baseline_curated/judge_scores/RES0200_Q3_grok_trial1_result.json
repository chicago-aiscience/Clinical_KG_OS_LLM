  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (worsening cough [P-1], sputum changes [P-6], increased dyspnea [P-1]) matching the Gold Answer's description, correctly attributes the diagnosis to the patient's established COPD history, and faithfully quotes the doctor's linkage in [D-52] about symptoms 'getting worse' in the context of COPD; minor differences in citation precision (e.g., Gold uses [P-5, P-8] for added detail on cough and dyspnea) and omission of details like exact timing or inhalers do not introduce errors, keeping all facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: three cardinal symptoms (worsening cough, sputum changes to yellow, increased dyspnea) with citations; COPD history as context; doctor's synthesis in [D-52]. Missed: detailed triggers (e.g., stairs [P-5]), precise timings (week for cough, few days for dyspnea [P-8]), COPD duration (~5 years [P-2]), and inhalers (Ventolin/Spiriva [P-11]); covers core ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: symptom quotes from [P-1, P-6] accurate; doctor's assessment paraphrase and citation [D-52] precise; no unverifiable details, hallucinations, or external 'knowledge graph' reliance impacting content (transcript suffices); fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing exact symptom combination (worsening cough, sputum changes, increased dyspnea) with COPD history and detailing doctor's linkage via progression and history in [D-52]; structured response perfectly focused, no tangents."
