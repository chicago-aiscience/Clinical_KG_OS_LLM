  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors regarding the systemic symptoms. It incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain an explicit denial of fever, whereas in [P-8] the patient clearly responds 'No, no, I've been fine' to the doctor's query about being feverish [D-8]. It also incorrectly attributes the headache denial to [P-6], which is actually a response about the lack of a bullseye rash; the headache denial occurs in [P-19].",
    "completeness": "The answer identifies the three primary local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness) but omits the patient's report of the tick being 'stuck pretty good'. It also misses the specific denial of the bullseye (target) rash, which is a key clinical finding mentioned in the Gold Answer. Most importantly, it fails to confirm the denial of fever, which was a specific requirement of the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer 'hallucinates' an absence of information by claiming the transcript lacks a fever denial. It also misrepresents the content of [P-6] by linking it to headaches when that turn is clearly about the local rash.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to answer both parts of the prompt (local and systemic symptoms) directly, though its internal accuracy is flawed."
