  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states the symptoms began about a week prior and that congestion/stuffiness was the initial symptom (consistent with P-3). It also captures that rhinorrhea became more prominent by the time of the visit, though it relies on P-10 rather than the clearer statement in P-3 (“now it’s mostly running”). A major factual error is the frequency/pattern: it concludes symptoms were “on and off” rather than constant, directly contradicting the patient’s later clarification that symptoms have been “pretty constant for the past week” (P-8). Because the question explicitly asks whether symptoms were constant or intermittent, this is a significant correctness issue.",
    "completeness": "Covered: ~1 week duration; initial congestion; later prominence of runny nose.\nMissed/insufficient: the explicit shift statement from P-3 (“felt pretty stuffy at first, but now it’s mostly running”); the key clarification that overall symptoms were pretty constant for the week (P-8) despite the initial “on and off” description (P-1); the fact that symptoms were not improving prompting the visit (P-1); the nuance that OTC decongestants helped “a little bit” and may have influenced perceived change (P-10).",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not well-grounded in the transcript: referencing a “knowledge graph” is not supported by the source. The reasoning that decongestants were taken “before the interview progressed to discussing the runny nose” is speculative and not established by the dialogue. The frequency conclusion selectively uses P-1 while ignoring the direct clinician question/answer in P-8, making the overall representation not faithful to the full transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the requested chronological progression (onset, first symptom, change in predominant symptom, and pattern). Minor irrelevant/unsupported framing (e.g., “knowledge graph”) does not substantially detract from topical relevance."
