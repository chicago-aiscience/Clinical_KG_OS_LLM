  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the only medication as a bronchodilator puffer and that the patient does not use a daily controller medication, aligning with the Gold Answer's core facts. However, it contains significant factual errors: it falsely claims the transcript 'does not contain a specific dialogue where the doctor asks about a daily controller medication' (contradicting D-5/P-5 where the doctor asks about a medication 'taken every day no matter what'), misattributes evidence (P-12 is about allergies, not medications), and specifies 'inhaled corticosteroid' which is plausible but not stated in the Gold or transcript. These discrepancies undermine accuracy on the third question part.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) sole medication is bronchodilator (rescue inhaler) used as-needed (D-4,P-4,D-6); (2) administered via 'puffer' (D-7,P-7); (3) no other medications (D-6,P-6,D-30,P-30); (4) doctor asked about 'one that you take every day no matter what' (daily controller/maintenance, D-5), patient does not have (P-5). Generated covers bronchodilator puffer (1+2), no daily controller (4 partially), but misses explicit as-needed/rescue distinction, multiple confirmations of sole medication, and precise type/phrasing of doctor's question. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like 'Knowledge Graph categorizes' are fully hallucinated (no such element in transcript). P-1 citation verifies bronchodilator mention. P-12 irrelevant (allergies diagnosis) and misused for no controller. Falsely states no specific dialogue on daily medication despite clear D-5/P-5 exchange. Inference of sole reliance plausible but evidence not fully grounded. Multiple hallucinations and inaccurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Answer is structured directly around the three question components (medication, administration, daily controller), with bullet points matching each part precisely; minor evidence issues do not detract from focus on the query."
