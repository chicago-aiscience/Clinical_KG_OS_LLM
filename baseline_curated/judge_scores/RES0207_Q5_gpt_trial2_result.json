  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main contributing factors in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose) and (2) hereditary predisposition (mother with epilepsy). It accurately cites the patient’s statements about forgetting medication [P-9] and taking Keppra [P-23], and the maternal history [P-26].\nMinor issues: it overstates causality by saying a missed dose is “directly causative” and that family history “causes” the underlying condition; the transcript supports “likely precipitated” and “predisposes,” not definitive causation.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: missed dose of Keppra as precipitant; epilepsy in mother/family history; explanation that family history indicates genetic predisposition relevant to the patient’s epilepsy diagnosis.\nKey points partially/fully missed: the specific reason for missing the dose (daughter’s birthday disrupting dinner routine) [P-24]; the note that seizures are usually infrequent (suggesting good control when adherent) [P-9]; the clinician’s framing of family history question [D-26].",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (missed medication [P-9], Keppra [P-23], maternal epilepsy [P-26]). However, repeated references to a “knowledge graph” establishing causal links are not in the transcript and introduce unsupported assertions. Also, the claim of direct causation is stronger than what the patient said (“I think that might have”).",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on hereditary and medication-related risk factors and explicitly addresses how family history relates to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis. No meaningful off-topic content beyond the unnecessary “knowledge graph” mention."
