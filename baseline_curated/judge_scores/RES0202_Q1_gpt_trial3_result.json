  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly lists several reported symptoms (dry cough with worsening course, fever ~100.1–101°F, fatigue, runny nose, reduced appetite, possible loss of taste) that match the Gold Answer. However, it is substantially incorrect about the doctor’s explicit symptom questions/denials: the doctor *did* explicitly ask about (and the mother denied) wheezing [P-7], sore throat [P-14], chest pain/heart racing [P-13], chills/night sweats [P-19], and multiple GI complaints (bowel changes, diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool, nausea/vomiting) [P-21 to P-23], among others. The Generated Answer also incorrectly claims denials of seizures/neurologic symptoms and dizziness/fainting were given via [P-32], which is actually about medication/allergies—this is a clear misattribution. It also treats “trouble swallowing” as a symptom rather than correctly noting uncertainty (the Gold specifies the mother was uncertain, not denying) [P-15].",
    "completeness": "Reported symptoms: mostly covered (dry cough, worsening, fever, fatigue, runny nose, decreased appetite, possible taste change), but it omits/does not clearly characterize the uncertainty around shortness of breath and the nuance that swallowing difficulty was uncertain rather than present/denied.\nDenied/asked symptoms: largely missing. It fails to include key Gold negatives: no sputum/blood [P-6], no wheeze [P-7], no chest pain/heart racing [P-13], no sore throat [P-14], no chills/night sweats [P-19], no rash/skin changes [P-20], no diarrhea/constipation/blood in stool [P-22], no nausea/vomiting [P-23], no urinary changes [P-24], no dizziness/fainting [P-25], no confusion/memory loss [P-26], and vision/hearing fine [P-18].",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not supported by the transcript and/or are mis-cited: claiming none of the example symptoms were explicitly asked about contradicts the transcript; attributing denial of seizures/dizziness/fainting to [P-32] is fabricated/misattributed. While some symptom statements are grounded in cited lines, the answer contains several hallucinated or incorrectly referenced claims.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (symptoms reported and symptom questions/denials), but it fails to provide the requested list of explicitly asked-and-denied symptoms and instead asserts (incorrectly) that they were not asked. Aside from an unnecessary mention of a “knowledge graph,” it stays within the clinical symptom domain."
