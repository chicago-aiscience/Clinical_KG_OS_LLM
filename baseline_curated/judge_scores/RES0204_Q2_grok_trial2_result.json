  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately quotes and cites the proposal for the COVID swab and its exact rationale from [D-39], which fully matches the corresponding facts in the Gold Answer and transcript. It does not introduce any incorrect facts, contradictions, or fabrications regarding the COVID swab. However, it completely omits the chest X-ray proposal from [D-37], which the Gold Answer identifies as a proposed diagnostic procedure. Since all stated claims are factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer, with no errors in the covered content, this scores high.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) confirmation of no medications/history; (2) chest X-ray proposal [D-37], explanation as internal body picture [D-39]; (3) COVID swab proposal; (4) specific rationale as institutional protocol for respiratory symptoms [D-39]; (5) swab discomfort and reassurance; (6) plan to arrange and discuss with supervising doctor. Generated covers only (3) COVID swab proposal and (4) rationale (~30-40% coverage), missing chest X-ray entirely, no-med confirmation, explanations, discomfort/plan details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (COVID swab proposal and rationale) are directly verifiable in transcript [D-39] with accurate citation. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's second part (rationale for COVID swab) perfectly and partially addresses the first part (diagnostic procedures, listing one of two). No off-topic content; focused and relevant to the query."
