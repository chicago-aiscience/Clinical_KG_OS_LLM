  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient's asthma history [P-16], symptoms of chest tightness and breathing difficulty [P-1, P-7], lack of rescue inhaler refill [P-17], and doctor's assessment of asthma recurrence [D-35]; these align with Gold. It also notes symptoms feel different [P-16] and lowers cardiac risk [D-36], consistent with Gold. No direct contradictions. However, it omits the key self-directed skip of evening maintenance dose [P-19, P-20], a core relation in Gold and question, and introduces 'knowledge graph' not in Gold or transcript, a minor discrepancy. Core facts accurate, minor issues: score 4.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: asthma history [P-16], feels different [P-16], no rescue refill [P-17, P-18], symptoms tightness/breathing on exertion [P-1, P-4, P-9 partially], doctor asthma top differential [D-35]. Missed: well-controlled for years [P-29], maintenance dose reduced to mornings only [P-19], skipping evening rationale [P-20], doctor's summary of limiting meds [D-34], phlegm/hoarseness [P-11], explicit lack of immediate symptom mitigation and plan for rescue [D-35]. Covers ~60% of points, especially misses central medication non-compliance details: score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like symptoms [P-1], asthma history [P-16], no rescue [P-17], doctor diagnosis [D-35, D-36] verifiable in transcript. However, repeated references to 'knowledge graph' (definition of exacerbation, links to rescue) not present in transcript—hallucinated. Interpretive summary of vulnerability plausible but adds unverifiable escalation detail. Some hallucination but mostly grounded: score 3.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses relation of asthma history and lack of rescue inhaler to current symptoms as exacerbation, matching question's core. Structured response focuses on clinical evidence, history, and medication lapse. Minor tangent on cardiac differentiation relevant. Omits maintenance skip but still on-topic: score 4."
