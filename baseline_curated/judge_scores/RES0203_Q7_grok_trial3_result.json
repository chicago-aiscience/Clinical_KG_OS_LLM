  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies that all three symptoms began approximately two days prior based on [P-1], aligning with Gold. It notes no worsening or fluctuation, which matches the 'consistent' reports in transcript, though without specific citations. However, it fails to explicitly state simultaneous onset with confirmation for cough [D-6, P-6], inaccurately cites [D-23, P-33] for prior symptoms (actual direct denial at [D-3, P-3]), and omits partial nature of symptoms and their persistence. Some factual errors in details and citations, but core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: simultaneous onset ~2 days (implied), no worsening/fluctuation (vaguely), no prior similar symptoms. Missed: explicit cough same-time confirmation [D-6,P-6], specific 'consistent' for sensory [D-5,P-5] and cough [D-8,P-8], no intermittent/variable, partial sensory losses persisting [P-4], doctor's COVID note [D-39]. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Onset claim verifiable [P-1]. No worsen/fluctuation inferred from lack of reports, but transcript has direct 'consistent' statements not cited. Prior symptoms: claim correct (no prior per denial), but citation [D-23,P-33] inaccurate ([D-23] chronic conditions, [P-33] alcohol; direct [D-3,P-3]). Minor inaccurate citations and unverifiable specifics, mostly grounded, no major hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom onset timing (relative implied same), lack of worsening/fluctuation, and no prior experience, perfectly matching question focus with no off-topic content."
