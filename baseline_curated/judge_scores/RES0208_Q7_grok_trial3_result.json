  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer, including misplacing 'difficulty breathing/shortness of breath' (from onset in Gold [P-1] and transcript) into the 'emerging' category; incorrectly citing sore throat to [P-6] (which is smell) instead of [P-9]; falsely claiming the patient 'does not explicitly vocalize' the cough (contradicted by [P-7,P-8]); attributing muscle aches primarily to the doctor [D-36] while Gold notes patient report [P-20,P-21]; omitting loss of smell entirely (Gold [P-6]); core timeline structure aligns but key misplacements and contradictions exist.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: onset SOB/fatigue/weakness ([P-1,P-2]), fever yesterday ([P-4]), loss of taste morning ([P-4]); partially covers emerging sore throat/cough. Missed: reduced appetite, diminished smell (new, [P-6]), headaches ([P-11,P-12]), laborious breathing detail ([P-3]), body aches explicitly in onset context; misplaces SOB and body aches to emerging; covers ~60% accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements: mentions non-existent 'provided knowledge graph'; wrong citation [P-6] for sore throat (actual smell); false claim patient 'does not explicitly vocalize' cough (patient does [P-7,P-8]); cough/muscle aches attributed mainly to doctor summary [D-36] rather than patient reports; most claims grounded but these errors indicate hallucination and poor verification against transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response into three timeline phases matching the question's categories (onset couple days ago, more recent like fever day before/loss of taste morning, just emerging at consultation), with no off-topic content."
