  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly notes onset of wheeziness 4-5 days ago [P-1], emergence of slight cough at presentation [P-1], and single nocturnal wheeziness [P-43], but incorrectly identifies cold weather as the initial trigger (P-38 mentions worsening in cold, but Gold and transcript specify initial trigger as playing tag/activity [P-3]); misattributes fluctuating pattern to past respiratory infections over two years [P-15] instead of current episodic pattern tied to activity/rest [P-5,P-6]; omits early symptom of difficulty taking deep breaths [P-2] and cough non-productivity [P-31]; hallucinates 'knowledge graph'; significant errors contradict Gold's core facts on trigger and pattern.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: onset 4-5 days [P-1], cough emergence [P-1], nocturnal episode [P-43,P-44]. Missed: initial trigger playing tag/activity [P-3], earliest symptoms wheezing + difficulty deep breaths [P-2], detailed fluctuating/episodic pattern resolving with rest recurring with activity [P-5,P-6], cough non-productive [P-31], pertinent negatives (no cyanosis [P-32], no fever [P-7], fine otherwise [P-9]). Covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: onset [P-1], cough [P-1], nocturnal [P-43]; but trigger cold weather verifiable in P-38 as worsening factor not initial; fluctuating pattern not grounded in P-15 (past infections unrelated to current episode, actual in P-5/P-6); hallucinates 'knowledge graph linking cold air to wheezing' (absent from transcript); multiple misinterpretations and one fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around question elements (onset, trigger, fluctuating pattern, cough emergence, nocturnal episode) with bullet points matching query; no off-topic content, fully addresses structure despite factual issues."
