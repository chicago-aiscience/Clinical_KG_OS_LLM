{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the asthma history, the lack of a rescue inhaler, the symptoms reported, and the doctor's differential diagnosis (asthma reoccurring vs. cardiac ischemia).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It completely ignores the patient's decision to skip the evening dose of the maintenance inhaler, which was a specific part of the prompt's question. 2) It misses the symptoms of increased phlegm and hoarseness. 3) It does not mention the doctor's specific summary in D-34 where the medication limitation is explicitly linked to the recurrence.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, but it hallucinates a source called a 'knowledge graph' twice (once regarding the definition of exacerbation and once regarding the treatment). There is no knowledge graph in the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the relationship between the patient's history and current symptoms, although it fails to incorporate one of the specific variables (the maintenance inhaler skip) mentioned in the prompt."
