  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual inaccuracies. It claims there is 'no specific indication' regarding whether symptoms worsened or fluctuated, whereas the transcript explicitly states they were 'pretty consistent' (P-5, P-8). It also states there is 'no evidence' regarding previous experiences, overlooking the patient's direct denial in P-3 ('No, no, nothing like this').",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it does not mention the simultaneous onset of all symptoms (confirmed in P-6), it misses the details about the partial nature of sensory loss (salty foods and strong smells), and it fails to cite the specific 'consistent' nature of the progression mentioned by the patient.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails to find the relevant information in the transcript. Specifically, it references P-33 (alcohol consumption) as a reason for lack of evidence regarding symptom history, while ignoring the explicit answer to that exact question in P-3. This suggests a failure to ground the response in the correct sections of the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant as it attempts to address all parts of the user's prompt (timing, progression, and history), although the quality of the content is low."
