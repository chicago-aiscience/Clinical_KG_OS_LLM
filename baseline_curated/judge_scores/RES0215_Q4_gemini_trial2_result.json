  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that the doctor does not ask about fever, runny nose, sick contacts, recent travel, rashes, or phlegm production. However, the transcript clearly shows the doctor asking about fever (D-7), runny nose (D-8), sick contacts (D-10), recent travel (D-11), rashes (D-13), and phlegm production (D-31).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer because it operates on the false premise that the questions were never asked. It misses the clinical reasoning for each symptom (e.g., screening for pneumonia, URI, or contagious etiologies).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a major hallucination regarding the content of the source transcript by claiming specific dialogues do not exist when they are explicitly present.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to provide a differential diagnosis (Asthma/Bronchitis) based on other parts of the transcript, it fails to address the specific question about the doctor's screening intent for the listed symptoms."
