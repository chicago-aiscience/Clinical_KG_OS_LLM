  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies shortness of breath as the 'most bothersome' symptom. The transcript explicitly states in P-12: 'it's been the cough has been the thing that's been the most bothersome.' This is a significant factual error regarding a primary component of the question.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several symptoms listed in the Gold Answer and transcript: sinus pressure (P-12), headache (P-14), and reduced exercise tolerance/difficulty walking the dog (P-4). It captures the main respiratory symptoms and the fever, but misses about 35-40% of the specific symptoms requested.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims regarding the presence of symptoms (cough, sputum, blood, fever) are grounded in the transcript. However, the claim that the patient identified shortness of breath as the 'primary' or 'most bothersome' symptom is a hallucination/misinterpretation that contradicts the explicit statement in P-12.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question (respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, and most bothersome symptom), though it provides incorrect information for the final part."
