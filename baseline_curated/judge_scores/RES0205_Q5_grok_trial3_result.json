  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer highlights acid reflux as potentially uncontrolled due to no medications [P-23] despite dietary help [P-25], hay fever as historical sensitivity without current symptoms, occupational risk despite PPE [P-17], and post-viral context with anxiety. Generated Answer accurately covers reflux history and management [P-22, P-25], hay fever sensitivity [P-27], and occupational exposure [P-17], with plausible links to cough persistence; minor discrepancies include stronger inference of hay fever prolonging symptoms (Gold notes no active contribution) and occupational as 'initial trigger' (Gold notes risk but caution), but core facts align without major errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: reflux details (diet-only, no meds, partial control, known cough cause), hay fever (history, no current role), occupational risk (PPE careful), post-viral [P-14], anxiety/distress context. Generated covers reflux (history, diet), hay fever (sensitivity prolonging post-infection), occupational (pathogen risk, trigger), post-viral persistence [P-14]; misses explicit no-medications for reflux, 'helped quite a bit' qualifier, hay fever lack of current activity, anxiety [P-22, P-35]; covers ~85% of keys.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited transcript claims accurate (e.g., reflux [P-22/P-25], hay fever [P-27], PPE/hospital [P-17], symptoms [P-2/P-5/P-14/P-15]); no fabricated patient facts; causal links (reflux irritation, hay fever sensitivity, occupational risk) are plausible expert inferences not directly in transcript but consistent with Gold; minor unverifiable medical generalizations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three specified factors (reflux, hay fever, occupational) and their relation to persistent cough outlasting symptoms, with symptom context enhancing focus; no off-topic content."
