  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four symptoms (fever, sore throat, stuffy nose, muscle ache) but fails completely on the second part of the question. It incorrectly claims that the transcript does not contain denials for cough, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and difficulty swallowing. These denials are explicitly present in P-10, P-8, P-7, P-5, and P-24 respectively.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first half of the question (identifying symptoms) but misses 100% of the specific clinically significant symptoms the patient denied, providing a false statement about the transcript's content instead.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the information is missing from the text. It also mentions that the doctor asked about 'ear pain' in [D-53], which is not in the transcript at all. It incorrectly states that the transcript segments provided are limited to P-1 and P-13, ignoring the full context provided in the prompt.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the first half of the question. However, for the second half, it fails to provide the requested information, although it stays 'on-topic' by attempting to explain why it cannot find the data (even though the explanation is factually wrong)."
