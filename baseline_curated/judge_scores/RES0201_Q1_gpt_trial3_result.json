  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies sore throat with dysphagia (fluids OK) and reports muscle aches and tiredness, and it correctly notes denial of loss of smell. However, it contains major factual errors/contradictions versus the transcript and Gold Answer: (1) it omits the patient’s key symptom of difficulty breathing (onset yesterday, constant, worsening). (2) It misstates the taste symptom: the patient reported reduced taste starting ~2 days prior and constant; the generated answer incorrectly says the patient “explicitly denied a loss of taste.” (3) It incorrectly claims that cough, runny nose, fever, headaches, and chest pain were “not mentioned,” when the patient explicitly denied each of these in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key reported symptoms in the Gold Answer: sore throat with worsening and difficulty swallowing food (PARTIALLY covered—no mention of worsening), difficulty breathing (MISSED), reduced taste (MISSED/incorrectly framed), fatigue and myalgias with timing (PARTIALLY covered—no onset timing; weakness clarification missing). Key explicit denials in the Gold Answer: cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, loss of smell, fever, chills/night sweats (ONLY loss of smell covered; the rest missed). Thus it captures well under half of the required elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: it asserts the patient denied loss of taste (contradicted by P-19 to P-21), and claims other screened symptoms were not mentioned (contradicted by explicit Q/A pairs P-15 to P-18 and P-23). The included correct items (sore throat, tiredness, muscle aches, no smell loss) are supported, but multiple contradictions reduce faithfulness substantially.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at listing reported symptoms and explicitly denied screened symptoms, which is what was asked. However, it fails to provide most of the denied screened symptoms and misses an important presenting symptom (dyspnea). The introductory “knowledge graph” language is unnecessary but not a major tangent."
