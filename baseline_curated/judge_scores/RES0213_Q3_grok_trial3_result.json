  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies anxiety-induced chest pain as the diagnosis, matching the Gold Answer's anxiety-related/stress-induced chest pain. Core supporting points like situational triggers, distraction relief, history of anxiety, current stress, breathing changes due to nervousness, and patient self-attribution to stress are consistent. Minor discrepancies include misattributing the history link directly to chest pain via P-20 (which refers to palpitations, not pain) and omitting pertinent negatives (e.g., no fevers, no exertional worsening), but no major factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: situational pattern (alone vs. distracted, partial via P-29 but misses P-4/P-9 details); anxiety history (partial, wrong cite); current stress (partial, covers school/quitting smoking but misses thesis specifics P-15/P-16); breathing/nervousness (yes, P-19); patient considers stress (yes, P-8). Missed entirely: all pertinent negatives (no fevers P-12, no exertional P-10, rest P-11, no palpitations outside anxiety P-20, no asthma P-23/24), which form a significant portion of Gold's reasoning. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims verifiable: situational/distraction [P-29 accurate]; breathing/nervousness [P-19 accurate]; stressors [P-13 accurate]; stress consideration [P-8 accurate]. Minor issue: P-20 cited for chest pain history link, but it specifically references heart fluttering in past anxiety, not chest pain (slight stretch/hallucination). No other fabrications; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by stating the diagnosis upfront and listing specific transcript-cited observations supporting it, with no off-topic content or tangents."
