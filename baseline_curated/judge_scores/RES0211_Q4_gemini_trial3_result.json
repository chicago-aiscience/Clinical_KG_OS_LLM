  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by claiming that the transcript does not contain information regarding eczema, EpiPen use, and night sweats. These conditions are explicitly discussed in turns [D-32], [D-21], and [D-9] respectively. It correctly identifies the screening for asthma but misses the specific screening questions for productive cough, rashes, GI symptoms, and joint pain described in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses the majority of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the screening for night sweats, productive cough, severe allergic reactions (EpiPen), eczema, rashes, GI symptoms, and joint pain. It only covers the asthma screening, which is approximately 15-20% of the relevant clinical screening performed by the doctor.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a significant failure in grounding. It explicitly states that the provided transcript segments do not contain certain information that is clearly present in the source text. This is a 'negative hallucination' where the model denies the existence of relevant data in the context provided.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. While it attempts to answer the question about asthma, it fails to address the other specific examples requested in the prompt (eczema, EpiPen, night sweats) despite the information being available in the text."
