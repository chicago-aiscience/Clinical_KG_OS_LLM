  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the nephew in daycare [P-11] as the exposure source, matching Gold. It links this to viral symptoms [P-1, D-39], consistent with Gold's viral URI assessment. Diabetes details [P-23, D-25] are accurate. Minor discrepancies: introduces non-existent 'Knowledge Graph' and refers to 'prompt notes' instead of transcript; does not note nephew lives with patient or that nephew was not sick but still possible source. Core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: nephew/daycare [P-11]; relation to viral symptoms [D-39]; type 1 diabetes [P-23] and management [D-25/P-25]. Missed: explicit 'lives with patient' from [P-11]; nephew 'fine' [P-12] but possible source; daycare as common source via reasoning (not KG); no transcript link of diabetes to immune risk; extra Gold details like endo [P-26], no other meds [P-27]. Covers ~80-90% of core points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like nephew/daycare [P-11], symptoms [P-1], doctor viral [D-39], diabetes/insulin [P-23/D-25] verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. Hallucinations: 'Knowledge Graph' listing daycare as cause (not in transcript); 'clinical documentation emphasizes' and 'prompt notes' immune effect misattribute external info. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements present.",
    "relevance": "Directly identifies exposure source from social history and relates to presentation (viral symptoms) and diabetes management/immune context per question. Minor off-topic via fabricated KG reference, but overall focused."
