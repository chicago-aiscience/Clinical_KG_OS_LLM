  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies four key factors: exposure history (hiking Fri/gardening Sat, uncertain timing [P-1]), tick attachment >72 hours [D-6], geographic risk (Strathroy creek [P-12], Lyme map shows concerning [D-13]), prior history (10y ago tick bite with bullseye rash treated w/ abx [P-3]). Generated covers exposure, duration, prior accurately. However, for geographic risk, it incorrectly attributes to deer tick vector identification [D-5] rather than location-specific assessment/map [D-13]; misses patient belief all ticks carriers [P-5], lab ID [D-6/D-18]. Some factual errors/misrepresentation on geo but core facts on other points correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: exposure history (hiking/gardening/uncertain [P-1]) - covered; duration (>72h [D-6]) - covered; geo risk (Strathroy/map concerning [P-12/D-13]) - missed; prior history (bullseye/abx [P-3]) - covered; additional (not deer-like [P-5], no rash [P-6], all ticks carriers [P-5], lab [D-6]) - partially (no rash/mismatch yes, others no). Covers ~75% of key points (3/4 main factors).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded in transcript with accurate citations: duration [D-6], exposure [P-1], prior [P-3], deer tick vector/mismatch [D-5/P-5 implied]. No hallucinations; interpretive framing of 'geographic risk' via species vector is plausible from context but stretched. Fully verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by listing the exact combination of four factors (exposure, duration, prior history, geographic risk) as bullet points, notes despite no rash/tick mismatch, perfectly focused on doctor's recommendation rationale."
