It started with just like a headache and cough four days ago and then I started getting some nausea and vomiting few days back as well as diarrhea.\n[P-3] Patient: It's been pretty persistent. Besides, when I take some Tylenol.\n[P-5] Patient: It's kind of like my forehead in the top of my head on both sides.\n[P-12] Patient: It's mostly a dry cough.\n[P-24] Patient: Uhm smell I feel like a little bit. I've been kind of losing my smell over the last I would say one day.\n[P-32] Patient: Yeah, I was having some. I'm having some nausea today, but I had some vomiting yesterday. I vomited two times.\n[P-38] Patient: No, I'm I'm pretty healthy. I don't really. I don't really even take any medications.\n\nQuestion: How did this patient's illness develop over the four-day course, specifying which symptoms appeared first, when the gastrointestinal symptoms and loss of smell began relative to the initial symptoms, and how the headache and cough changed or remained stable in severity over time?\n\nAnswer:",
