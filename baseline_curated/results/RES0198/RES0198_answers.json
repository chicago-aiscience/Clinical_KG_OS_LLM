Evidence is found in [P-1], where the patient states, \"I've had the stuffy nose... as well as a runny nose for the past week.\" The persistence of the runny nose was later confirmed in [P-10], where the patient notes, \"Well, I guess my nose is runny now.\"\n\n**Character of Nasal Discharge**\nThe transcript does not contain a description of the character of the nasal discharge (e.g., whether it was thick, yellow, green, or clear). While [P-10] confirms the nose is \"runny,\" there are no qualitative descriptors regarding the fluid.\n\n**Denial of Related Symptoms**\nThere is no evidence in the provided transcript segments that the patient explicitly denied related symptoms such as sore throat, cough, post-nasal drip, or loss of taste/smell. The patient's discussion in [P-1] and [P-10] is limited to the nasal symptoms mentioned above, whereas [P-11] refers to living arrangements with a nephew and [P-23] refers to a history of type one diabetes.",

The patient noted the symptoms have persisted \"for the past week\" and are \"not getting better\" ([P-1]), which aligns with the natural progression of a common cold. The doctor later noted that such infections typically take \"a few weeks\" for relief ([D-39]), reinforcing the viral classification.\n\n**2. Exposure History**\nA critical factor in the differential diagnosis was the patient's recent exposure to potential viral vectors. The patient stated they \"live with who goes to daycare\" ([P-11]). The Knowledge Graph explicitly links \"daycare exposure\" to \"[DIAGNOSIS] viral infection / common cold,\" providing the contextual evidence that supports the viral rather than allergic or bacterial origin.\n\n**3.
