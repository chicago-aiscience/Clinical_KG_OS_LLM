  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer lists two current medications (Claritin carried 'just in case' for allergies, and Deyo oral contraceptive taken regularly for three months). Generated Answer only lists Claritin as current/carrying, completely omitting Deyo despite explicit mentions in [P-25, P-26, P-27, D-28, P-28]. Gold also notes no medication allergies and no EpiPen, which are absent in Generated. Past allergy shots details match. This omission of a key current medication (Deyo, stated as 'I take birth control') represents a significant factual discrepancy compared to Gold, though stated facts are accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) Claritin (carries not taking actively, seasonal allergies, 'just in case' [P-16,P-25]); 2) Deyo (oral contraceptive, 3-month pill, takes regularly [P-25-28]); 3) No med allergies [P-16]; 4) Past allergy shots (once/week in winter [P-16,P-20]); 5) No EpiPen, seasonal allergies not severe [P-18,P-21]. Generated covers Claritin fully and allergy shots fully; misses Deyo entirely, no allergies, no EpiPen. Covers ~50% of key points (main meds and treatment partially).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated verifiable in transcript: Claritin carrying/not taking now [P-25], allergies [P-16], shots frequency [P-20]. Citations accurate [P-16,P-25,P-20]. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; omission does not constitute fabrication.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly lists current medication (Claritin) with indication/status and past allergist treatment (shots) with frequency, using bullet format matching question's request for names/indications/dosing. No off-topic content; perfectly focused despite incompleteness."
