{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the doctor recommended a COVID swab test, advised isolation for 14 days due to COVID-like symptoms, and specifically mentioned isolating from the child’s younger sister. These points match the Gold Answer and are supported by the transcript (D-44). No incorrect or contradictory statements are present.",
    "completeness": "It includes the core items explicitly asked in the question: diagnostic test (COVID swab), isolation instruction and duration (14 days), and the specific household member to isolate from (younger sister). However, it omits several additional management measures present in the Gold Answer/transcript that also fall under “management,” including: expected test turnaround (24–48 hours), discussion of false negatives/possibility of other viral illness, and ER/return precautions (high fever, seizures/neurologic symptoms, weakness/dizziness, fainting).",
    "faithfulness": "All included recommendations are directly grounded in the transcript and appropriately cited to D-44. No hallucinated details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on management measures and directly addresses the requested elements (test, isolation duration, and who to isolate from), without extraneous content."
