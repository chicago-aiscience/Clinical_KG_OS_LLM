  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the situations in which the pain occurs. It claims the pain occurs 'only during episodes of anxiety attacks' [P-20], whereas the transcript [P-20] clearly indicates that the 'anxiety attack' mention was in response to a question about heart fluttering, not chest pain. The chest pain actually occurs while walking or studying [P-4, P-29]. It accurately identifies the quality (sharp, strong) and episode duration (20 minutes).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the overall duration of the symptoms (1.5 weeks), the 'odd/uncomfortable' description, and the specific situations where the pain resolves (talking to people, hands-on tasks, school activities). It also misses that the pain occurs at rest and does not worsen with exercise.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the relationship between the chest pain and anxiety attacks. The transcript section cited [P-20] discusses heart palpitations/fluttering, which the patient says only happened during past anxiety attacks. The patient explicitly states they haven't had such attacks in eight years [P-21], though they feel they might get them again.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each part of the question (quality, duration, triggers, situations). However, the information provided within those relevant sections is largely incorrect or incomplete."
