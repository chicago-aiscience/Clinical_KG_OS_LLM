  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies decreased smell as partial (consistent with Gold), mild dry cough, but incorrectly states taste loss as complete (Gold specifies partial, with ability to taste very salty foods but not normal items like banana); misses duration of two days and consistency; significant factual contradiction on taste degree vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3 symptoms (smell partial w/ bad odor detail, taste partial w/ salty yes/banana no, mild dry cough), 2-day duration, consistent sensory losses, cough non-productive/no blood, consistent severity, same onset, no triggers. Covered: symptoms list, smell partial (basic), cough mild dry (~30% coverage); missed: duration, sensory specifics/details on perceptions, consistency, cough details (onset, triggers, non-productive confirmation). Covers 20-49%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in P-1 (reduced smell, lost taste, mild dry cough verifiable); however, 'complete loss of taste' not fully verifiable as P-4 clarifies partial (salty yes, normal no), selective citation ignores nuance; no fabrication but incomplete representation; some unverifiable details on degree.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists sensory (smell/taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms with degrees, matching question focus; no off-topic content but omits requested perception details; mostly relevant."
