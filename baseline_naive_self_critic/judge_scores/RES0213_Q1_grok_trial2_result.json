  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately summarizes quality as sharp strong pain on deep breath, 1.5 weeks overall, 20-min intermittent episodes, occurs when alone (walking/studying), resolves when social/at school, at rest, not worse with exercise, no injury, first time. Generated correctly captures quality ('very sharp and strong'), deep breath trigger, 20-min duration. However, it significantly errs by claiming pain 'only during episodes of anxiety attacks' citing P-20 (which refers to heart fluttering, not pain), contradicting Gold and transcript where pain is pleuritic/situational, possibly stress-related but not exclusively anxiety attacks. Misses overall duration, specific occur/resolve situations, exercise relation. Significant contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1.5 weeks; quality (uncomfortable to sharp on deep breath); 20-min intermittent; occur alone (walking school, studying); resolve social/school; at rest; not worse exercise; no injury; first time. Generated covers quality (sharp/strong), deep breath, 20-min duration. Misses overall duration, detailed occur/resolve (alone vs social), rest/exercise, injury, prior occurrence. Adds unrelated treatment/context. Covers ~25-30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Quality, deep breath, duration verifiable [P-3,P-6,P-7]. 'Only during anxiety attacks' not in transcript; P-20 is about heart flutter during anxiety, not chest pain (hallucination/misattribution). Context stress/family/smoking verifiable but tangential. Treatment verifiable [P-6]. Multiple inaccuracies including wrong claim and citation.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around quality, duration, situations (though erroneous), addresses question core. Adds context/treatment (minor tangents) but focused on characteristics."
