  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect regarding the second part of the question. It claims that the doctor did not ask about wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, or GI complaints. However, the transcript and gold answer confirm the doctor explicitly asked about wheezing (D-7), chest pain (D-13), sore throat (D-14), chills (D-19), and GI complaints (D-22, D-23). The first part regarding symptoms the mother reported is mostly accurate.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide the list of symptoms denied by the mother, which was a specific requirement of the prompt. It covers the symptoms the child had (cough, fever, fatigue, runny nose, loss of appetite/taste) but misses the entire list of pertinent negatives provided in the gold answer and transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant hallucination by stating the doctor did not ask about the symptoms listed in the prompt. This claim is directly contradicted by the source transcript. It also incorrectly points to D-44 (future monitoring instructions) as the doctor's inquiries for current symptoms, rather than the actual diagnostic interview (D-7 through D-26).",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it addresses the first half of the question. However, it fails to provide the information requested in the second half, instead providing a false claim that the information does not exist in the text."
