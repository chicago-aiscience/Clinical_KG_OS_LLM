  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details a 3-month chronic intermittent dry cough worsening to productive greenish sputum over 3 days, with no blood or foul smell, nocturnal awakening for 1 month causing fatigue, cough-associated chest discomfort, subjective fevers, and exercise impairment; denials include night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, body pain, sick contacts. Generated Answer incorrectly states cough duration as 1 month (contradicts P-2's 3 months), omits initial dry/recurrent nature, recent productive change, sputum details (no blood/smell), fevers, exercise impact, most denial specifics (only vaguely notes two without naming symptoms), mischaracterizes chest pain without noting it's only with coughing; significant errors on duration, omissions, and vague denials.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered partially: greenish gross sputum (partial), cough-associated chest hurt, fatigue, sleep disruption; misses: 3-month duration/initial dry/intermittent/start at pole dancing, 3-day productive worsening, no blood/no smell, last-month nightly awakening specificity, subjective fevers, exercise impairment; denials only vaguely covers 2/8+ (night sweats, weight loss unnamed); covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: greenish gross sputum [P-9], hurts when cough [P-3], tired/sleep poor from cough [P-19,20]; unverifiable/misrepresented: cough 'one month' [P-1 misleading, contradicts P-2/P-13 3 months]; hallucinated: 'associated knowledge graph' and 'cough causes chest pain' linkage not in transcript; denial quotes accurate but unspecified symptoms; multiple distortions and fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response into reported respiratory/associated symptoms (cough, sputum, chest pain, fatigue, sleep) and explicitly denied symptoms, matching question focus on respiratory symptoms, cough/sputum characteristics, and denials; minor irrelevance in hallucinated KG reference but no major tangents."
