  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several absent Lyme features from the transcript: no erythema migrans/bullseye rash (asked at D-6; denied at P-6), no joint pain (D-7; P-7), and no fever/feeling ill (D-8; P-8). It also correctly lists the proposed evaluations: physical exam, sending the tick for species identification, and blood work for Lyme serology/titres (all stated at D-18).\n\nHowever, it contains a clear factual/interpretive error: it states the patient said they were “just for my cholesterol,” implying no systemic illness ([P-14]). In the transcript, P-14 is the patient answering a different question (what they see their family doctor for), not describing current systemic symptoms. This is an incorrect use of the quote and reasoning. The answer also omits that the clinician screened for headaches (D-19; denied P-19/P-20), which is part of the Gold Answer’s “active Lyme” symptom screen.",
    "completeness": "Included key absent features: bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/feeling ill. \nMissing key absent features from Gold Answer: headache screening/absence (D-19/P-19/P-20), the explicit “feeling well otherwise/totally fine” confirmation (D-18/P-18), and the confirmation of no other bites on self/husband (P-9). \nIncluded proposed tests: physical exam, tick lab ID, blood work serology/titres. \nMissing proposed-plan detail from Gold Answer: plan to consult supervising physician before finalizing (D-13, D-22).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in transcript, especially the symptom questions and proposed tests. The main faithfulness issue is the misuse of P-14 (“just for my cholesterol”) as evidence of absence of systemic illness; that claim is not supported by the transcript context and is effectively a fabricated inference. Some citations are also slightly mismatched (e.g., using P-1 instead of the direct denial at P-6), though the underlying point is still consistent with the visit.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on (1) which active-Lyme clinical features were assessed and absent and (2) what tests were proposed to evaluate/exclude Lyme disease. No major tangents beyond a brief, unnecessary mention of a “knowledge graph.”"
