  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a major factual error regarding the source material, stating that the transcript segments ([P-1] to [P-26]) do not include the doctor's dialogue or concluding remarks. This is incorrect, as the provided transcript includes dialogues up to [P-33]. Consequently, it fails to state the plan mentioned in [D-33].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 100% of the first part of the question (the stated plan). Regarding the clinical information, it covers several key points (chest pain, deep breath trigger, failed OTC meds, family history, and smoking) but misses others included in the Gold Answer, such as pertinent negatives (no fever, no asthma, no trauma) and specific details like the patient's living situation and multivitamin use.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a limitation in the source text (claiming only P-1 to P-26 were provided) which is not true based on the provided Source Transcript. This meta-hallucination led to the omission of the concluding remarks.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it summarizes the clinical information gathered from the patient's perspective, it explicitly states it cannot answer the first half of the prompt regarding the doctor's plan, which was clearly available in the text."
