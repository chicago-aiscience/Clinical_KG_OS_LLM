  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely accurate but misses the specific mention of chest tightness, which was confirmed in the transcript (D-20, P-20). It also omits the two-week duration of the symptoms which the patient clarified during the consultation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points: dry cough character, shortness of breath, wheezing, and the comparison between daytime and nighttime frequency. However, it fails to mention 'chest sensations' (chest tightness), which was explicitly requested in the prompt and present in the Gold Answer. It also misses the specific detail from the Gold Answer regarding the duration (two weeks).",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript and correctly cited. The observation about cold air making things worse is accurately pulled from P-11.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure. It addresses almost all parts of the question, only failing to include the 'chest sensations' detail specifically asked for in the prompt's instructions ('including details about... chest sensations')."
