  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It falsely claims that the doctor has no turns in the transcript (attributing turns only to [P-1] through [P-42]), when in fact the transcript includes [D-1] through [D-44]. Consequently, it incorrectly states that no plan was communicated. It also claims deep breathing was not explicitly named as a trigger, despite the patient explicitly stating 'Taking a deep breath makes it feel pretty bad' in [P-18].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the doctor's stated plan (consulting the supervisor), the use of expectoration as a self-care measure, and deep breathing as an aggravating factor. It covers approximately 60% of the key clinical points found in the Gold Answer (Tylenol, exertion, coughing, rest).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It hallucinates that the transcript is one-sided and lacks doctor statements. It also refers to a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided in the source context, suggesting the model is relying on external or hallucinated data rather than the provided text.",
    "relevance": "While the answer uses the correct headers to address the prompt, the content within those headers is largely undermined by the incorrect assumption that the doctor's dialogue was missing from the source text."
