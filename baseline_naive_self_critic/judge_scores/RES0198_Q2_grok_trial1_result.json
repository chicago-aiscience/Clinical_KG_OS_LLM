  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the medication tried ('decongestants' from [P-10]), matches the patient's direct quote on effectiveness ('worked a little bit' from [P-10]), and correctly notes the doctor's OTC recommendation ('Tylenol Cold' from [D-39]). It aligns fully with the factual content of the Gold Answer, with no contradictions or errors, though it omits some nuanced explanation of ambiguity in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) patient tried 'decongestants' [P-10] - covered; (2) assessment ambiguous, 'worked a little bit' with reasoning about runny nose [P-10] - partially covered (direct quote but misses full reasoning/ambiguity); (3) doctor's rec includes hydration, supportive care, Tylenol Cold [D-39] - partially covered (Tylenol Cold yes, misses hydration and supportive care context). Covers core elements of the three-part question but misses ~20% of elaborative details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'decongestants' and 'worked a little bit' in [P-10]; 'Tylenol Cold' in [D-39]. Citations accurate. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured bullet-point style directly addressing the question's three components (medication tried, assessment, doctor's OTC rec) with no off-topic content or tangents; perfectly focused."
