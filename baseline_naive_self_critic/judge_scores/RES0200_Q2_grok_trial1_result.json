  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Ventolin and Spiriva as respiratory inhalers (matching Gold [P-11]), atorvastatin ('Torva Staten') as the current non-respiratory drug ([P-38]), and blood pressure medications (specifically a diuretic per [P-35]) as discontinued without approval ([P-34, P-36]). However, it has minor discrepancies: it does not specify Ventolin as 'as needed,' misses the exact frequency of ~10 times per week ([P-12]), and refers to the discontinued med generally as 'blood pressure medications' instead of 'a diuretic.' Core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: respiratory inhalers (Ventolin, Spiriva), non-respiratory (atorvastatin), discontinued med (BP meds without approval). Missed: specific Ventolin use frequency ('approximately 10 times' [P-12]), 'as needed' for Ventolin, exact 'diuretic' for BP med, and doctor's response context. Covers ~70-80% of key points, missing critical quantification for Ventolin frequency which is explicitly asked.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: Ventolin/Spiriva [P-11], Torva Staten for cholesterol [P-38, D-39 implied], BP history/discontinuation [P-34]. No hallucinations; 'a lot more recently' matches [P-11], though P-12 detail omitted. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured perfectly around the question's components: lists meds by category, addresses Ventolin frequency, and identifies discontinued med directly, with no off-topic content."
