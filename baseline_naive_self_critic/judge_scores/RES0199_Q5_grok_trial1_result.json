  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer accurately details the doctor's systematic exploration of living situation (D-45/P-45, D-46/P-46), sick contacts (D-47/P-47), workplace (D-48/P-48, D-50/P-50), and travel (D-49/P-49) after P-38, plus substance use and conclusion of no clear source. The Generated Answer falsely claims no such exploration occurred, denying any dialogue on these topics despite direct transcript evidence, resulting in complete factual contradiction. Score: 1.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: living situation/apt alone, environmental triggers (denied), sick contacts (possible at work lunchroom), workplace/car dealership/ no sick colleagues, travel/none, substance use screening, no clear source. Generated covers 0% of these, instead asserting none were explored and listing unrelated symptom assessment/management. Score: 1.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absence of explicit transcript segments (e.g., claims 'No dialogue segments referenced asking about travel plans, the workplace setting, or who the patient may have interacted with' but D-47/D-48/D-49/D-50 directly contradict this). Symptom citations (P-1/P-12/P-24/D-52) are verifiable but irrelevant to question; contact tracing mention (D-52) misrepresented as non-exploration. Largely fabricated denial of content. Score: 1.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses the question by explicitly denying exploration of the specified sources (living, workplace, travel, contacts) and contrasts with what was focused on, with no off-topic content. Score: 5."
