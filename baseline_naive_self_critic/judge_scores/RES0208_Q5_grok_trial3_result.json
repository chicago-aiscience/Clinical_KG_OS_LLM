  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the provided transcript segments (citing [D-36] through [P-9]) do not contain information on the patient's grandson contact, daycare, cold symptoms, travel, or client visits, despite the full transcript clearly including these details (e.g., [P-23], [D-24], [P-24], [P-31], [P-32]). It contradicts the Gold Answer by denying the existence of key exposure facts and shifts focus to symptoms, introducing factual errors about transcript content and hallucinating a 'knowledge graph' not present. Core facts about exposures are absent and misrepresented, leading to significant contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) Grandson visit last weekend with cold from daycare [P-23]; (2) Family unaware of illness; (3) Symptoms started couple days after [P-1]; (4) Doctor acknowledges exposure [D-24]; (5) No travel outside province [D-24/P-24]; (6) Works 95% from home, no recent client visits (couple weeks ago) [P-31/P-32]; (7) Supports infection assessment [D-36]. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead discussing unrelated symptoms and falsely claiming absence of exposure info.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer references actual transcript parts for symptoms (e.g., [P-1], [P-3], [P-4], [D-36]) but hallucinates 'transcript segments ([D-36] through [P-9])' limiting scope (full transcript provided) and introduces non-existent 'knowledge graph [KG]'. Key claims about missing exposure info are unverifiable and false against full transcript ([P-23] explicitly details grandson); multiple hallucinations about source material.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on grandson exposure connection to infection assessment and exclusion of other pathways (travel, client visits). Generated Answer addresses symptoms' role in assessment but dismisses exposures as absent from 'text,' failing to analyze or connect the actual transcript details, making it largely off-topic and non-responsive to the core query."
