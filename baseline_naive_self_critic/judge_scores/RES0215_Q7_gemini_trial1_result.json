  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the timeline (4-5 days), the initial trigger (playing tag), and the emergence of the cough. However, it contains a major factual error by explicitly stating that the transcript contains no information about a nocturnal episode, whereas the gold answer and transcript (P-43, P-44) clearly describe one. It also incorrectly attributes the fluctuating pattern to past viral infections and weather rather than the rest-activity cycle described in P-6.",
    "completeness": "The response misses two key components of the symptom development: the specific rest/activity cycle that defines the fluctuating pattern and the entire nocturnal episode. It covers about 50% of the gold answer's key points accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer 'hallucinates' an absence of information. It claims the transcript does not mention a nocturnal episode or symptoms during sleep, which is directly contradicted by P-43 and P-44. The link between current symptoms and the two-year history of viral infections is an interpretive leap not present in the gold answer's description of the current illness progression.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant as it structured its response to directly follow the sub-questions in the prompt, even though it failed to extract the correct information for one of them."
