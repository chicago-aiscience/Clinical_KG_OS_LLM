  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis (Bacterial Pneumonia or Acute Bronchitis) but fails on clinical details. It states the cough lasted one month, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer specify a three-month intermittent cough with a three-day acute worsening. Most significantly, it claims the transcript does not mention fevers, which is factually incorrect as the patient explicitly reports feeling 'hot at night' in [P-4].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to address one of the three clinical features requested in the prompt: 'subjective fever.' Instead of explaining how the fever contributes to the diagnosis, it dismisses the symptom's existence in the text and substitutes it with fatigue/malaise. It also misses the temporal distinction (acute vs. chronic) of the cough highlighted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a direct hallucination regarding the content of the transcript by stating, 'the transcript does not explicitly mention fevers.' This contradicts the source text [P-4]. It also mischaracterizes the cough duration based on the patient's statement in [P-2].",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it fails to follow the prompt's specific instruction to explain the contribution of 'subjective fever.' By replacing a required clinical feature with other symptoms (fatigue), it deviates from the specific question asked."
