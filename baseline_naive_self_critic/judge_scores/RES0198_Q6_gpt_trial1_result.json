  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated working diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), supportive care (hydrate; OTC medication like Tylenol Cold), COVID swab ordered with results in ~48 hours, and public health guidance (isolate at home and await further instructions from public health). It does not introduce any direct contradictions. The phrasing that the swab is to “rule it out” is a reasonable inference from the doctor’s statement about symptom overlap and testing, but it is not explicitly stated as “rule out.”",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) working diagnosis of viral infection/common cold; (2) supportive care—hydration; (3) supportive care—OTC meds like Tylenol Cold; (4) COVID swab today; (5) results in 48 hours; (6) isolate at home/not see anyone; (7) further instructions from public health.\nKey Gold Answer elements missed: (a) expectation-setting that symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve; (b) explicit statement that there is “not much we can do besides supportive care” (i.e., limited treatment beyond supportive care).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly grounded in [D-39]. Minor ungrounded content includes the reference to a “knowledge graph” (not in transcript) and the explicit “rule it out” framing (implied but not verbatim). Otherwise, the answer closely tracks the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested components of the end-of-visit plan: diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, test ordered, and public health guidance. The brief mention of a “knowledge graph” is extraneous but does not materially distract."

  "summary": "Accurate and highly relevant summary of the plan, but not fully complete because it omits the doctor’s expectation that symptoms may take a few weeks to resolve and that little beyond supportive care is available, with minor ungrounded phrasing."
