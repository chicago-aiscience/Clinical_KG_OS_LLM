  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect and directly contradicts the transcript and the gold answer. It claims the doctor did not screen for fever, dyspnea, or sore throat, but the transcript shows explicit screening for fever [D-10], difficulty breathing [D-11], headaches [D-12], sore throat [D-13], chills/sweats [D-14], muscle aches [D-15], and chest pain [D-22].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to provide any of the negative findings requested by the prompt. It missed 100% of the key points regarding symptoms confirmed as absent and the explanation of how they informed the clinical picture.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It incorrectly asserts that information is missing when it is clearly present. This is a significant hallucination regarding the content of the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "While the answer mentions the positive symptoms found in the transcript, it completely fails to address the primary question regarding the systematic screening for negative findings, rendering it irrelevant to the specific task."
