  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly categorizes the symptoms into the requested timeframes. However, it contains a factual error in mapping: it attributes the patient's response regarding a sore throat [P-9] to the development of a cough. It also fails to identify the sore throat as a distinct emerging symptom, despite the patient confirming he was 'starting to feel a little bit like that' in response to the doctor's query about it.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the gold answer and transcript: generalized body aches (present from onset), diminished sense of smell (this morning), and the sore throat (emerging). It also omits the discussion about the patient's headaches. It covers approximately 60-70% of the clinical details provided in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly faithful to the transcript. However, it exhibits a minor hallucination of context by citing [P-9] (the sore throat discussion) as evidence for the 'Dry Cough' section. Additionally, it labels a 'dry throat sensation' which the patient described as a sensation related to the cough being 'on its way' rather than a distinct throat symptom.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure (onset, recent, emerging) perfectly without irrelevant information."
