  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly notes the cough began ~4–5 days before the visit (consistent with Gold: [P-2, P-4]) and that the patient said it wasn’t going away/getting better ([P-2]). However, it contains major factual errors relative to the Gold Answer/transcript: (1) it states there is “no clinical information” about runny nose, but the transcript clearly documents a runny nose for “the past couple of days” with clear discharge ([P-11, P-12]); (2) it implies persistence “or worsened,” whereas the patient said the cough “kind of stayed the same” ([P-7]); (3) it adds non-transcript assertions about a “clinical knowledge graph” and that procedures “confirm the focus on the cough,” which is not how the transcript supports symptom characterization. These errors contradict key parts of the Gold Answer about relative timing and symptom evolution.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: cough onset ~4–5 days; patient felt it wasn’t improving.\nKey Gold Answer points missed or incorrectly handled: dry/non-productive nature of the cough with explicit denial of sputum ([P-5, P-6]); stability of cough severity over time ([P-7]); runny nose onset later for only a couple of days and its relationship to cough timing ([P-11]); clear nasal discharge ([P-12]); comparison to prior episodes—never had a dry cough like this and prior runny noses did not last this long ([P-24]). It also omits the Gold’s framing that this was a novel acute episode for the patient.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “clinical knowledge graph,” the claim that the transcript lacks runny nose information (directly contradicted by [P-11, P-12]), and the inference that the cough is the primary reason for chest X-ray/COVID swab in a confirmatory way. While fever/chills and asthma-family-history comments are transcript-based ([P-13, P-28]), the overall answer includes several hallucinated/unsupported elements and misses explicitly stated symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically for temporal development (dry cough vs runny nose timing/duration), cough severity changes, and comparison with prior similar symptoms. The answer addresses cough onset somewhat but fails to address runny nose timing (and incorrectly denies its presence), mischaracterizes change in cough severity, and only partially addresses prior comparison. It also includes tangential material (fever/chills, asthma) not central to the asked timeline comparison."
