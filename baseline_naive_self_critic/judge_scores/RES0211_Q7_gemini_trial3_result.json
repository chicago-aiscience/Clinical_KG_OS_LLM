  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is highly inaccurate. It claims the transcript does not state the chronological order of symptoms, but the patient explicitly states in [P-4] that her throat was scratchy first, followed by coughing. Furthermore, it claims there is no mention of feeling hot, despite the patient stating 'I have felt really hot' in [P-7] and 'I felt hot like all the time' in [P-9].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to provide any of the specific details requested. It misses the initial symptom (scratchy throat), the sequence (throat then cough), and the entire 'feeling hot' component of the question, which the Gold Answer covers in detail.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer exhibits a high level of hallucination regarding the absence of information. It claims information is missing from the transcript when that information is explicitly present in multiple dialogue turns (P-4, P-7, P-9).",
    "relevance": "While the generated answer attempts to structure its response according to the question, it provides negative answers (claiming info is missing) for all parts, failing to actually address the substance of the query."
