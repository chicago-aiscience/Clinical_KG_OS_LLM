  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript, including the diagnosis as a likely viral common cold, supportive care (hydration and Tylenol Cold), COVID swab with 48-hour results, and isolation/public health follow-up. Minor rephrasing of diagnosis (e.g., 'common cold caused by a viral infection') is consistent, and noting COVID as potential (to rule out) aligns with transcript's pandemic context mention without contradiction.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnosis (viral/common cold), supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (COVID swab today, 48 hours), public health (isolation at home/not see others, further public health instructions). Missed: explicit mention of symptom duration ('a few weeks to resolve') and 'not much that we can do besides supportive care' expectation-setting from Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All specific claims (diagnosis, hydration, Tylenol Cold, swab, isolation, public health follow-up, 48 hours) are directly verifiable in [D-39]. COVID as 'potential cause to rule out' is grounded in transcript's 'symptoms can also be seen in covid patients, so we will get a swab.' Minor unverifiable addition: 'knowledge graph' not in transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question's required elements (diagnosis, specific supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance), using clear headers matching the query without tangents."
