{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer has significant factual errors compared to Gold Answer: incorrectly states symptoms developed after returning home on Thursday (transcript and Gold specify Wednesday [P-1]); omits mother's explicit concern about COVID from school [P-2]; misrepresents sick contacts outside school by citing irrelevant [P-8] instead of direct quote [P-38]; falsely claims no transcript info on school notification despite [P-39] and Gold's coverage.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered partially: school as potential source (but timeline wrong); no known sick contacts at/outside school (incompletely). Missed: mother's COVID-school concern [P-2]; exact sick contact quotes [P-38]; school no notification [P-39]; school test requirement [P-41]; no travel/env exposures. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple inaccuracies vs transcript: timeline error (Thursday vs Wednesday [P-1]); irrelevant [P-8] for sick contacts; incorrect claim that transcript lacks school notification info ([P-39] states 'They haven't contacted us'); no hallucinations but poor verification and omissions lead to ungrounded statements.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses school as source and sick contacts in/out school; minor irrelevant detail ([P-8]); completely misses school notification but overall focused on question."
