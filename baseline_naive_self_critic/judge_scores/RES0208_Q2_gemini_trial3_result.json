  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the transcript does not provide the name of the reflux medication or details about a change in regimen. In reality, the transcript [P-27] explicitly mentions 'Tums' and that the patient 'stopped' his previous medication because he 'figured out the foods' that helped. It correctly identifies Avodart for prostate issues, but fails on all other counts compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key components: it fails to mention Tums, it fails to mention that the patient discontinued a previous medication, and it fails to explain the reason for the change (dietary modification/figuring out foods). It only covers approximately 30-40% of the Gold Answer's content.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is not present in the transcript when it is clearly stated in segment [P-27]. While the portion about Avodart is faithful, the dismissal of the reflux details is a failure to ground the answer in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is relevant in that it attempts to address all parts of the multi-part question. However, because it concludes the information is missing, it fails to provide the actual substance requested by the prompt."
