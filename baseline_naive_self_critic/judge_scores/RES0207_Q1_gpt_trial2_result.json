  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient’s sudden shortness of breath [P-1], dry cough [P-4], and neurologic symptom of a seizure the prior night with known epilepsy [P-8]. However, it is factually incorrect regarding fever: the patient explicitly reported an objective temperature measurement of 37.4°C taken that morning [P-5, P-6]. Saying the patient did not provide an objective fever measurement directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer, which is a major error because it addresses a core part of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer:\n- Respiratory: sudden-onset SOB on waking and cough starting that morning; cough is dry/no sputum. (Generated covers SOB and dry cough but omits sudden onset/timing and the “no sputum” detail.)\n- Neurologic: seizure last night; has epilepsy; felt fine afterward. (Generated covers seizure last night and epilepsy but omits “felt fine after.”)\n- Fever: objective measurement 37.4°C measured that morning. (Generated entirely misses and contradicts this.)\nOverall, it captures some respiratory and neurologic symptoms but fails the fever measurement and omits several descriptive details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure/epilepsy [P-8]). The claim that the patient did not provide an objective fever measurement is not only unsupported but contradicted by [P-5], making the answer partially unfaithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked domains (respiratory symptoms, neurologic symptom, fever measurement) without irrelevant tangents. The main issue is correctness/completeness, not relevance."
