  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the facts from the transcript and gold answer: the diagnostic test is a COVID swab, the isolation duration is 14 days, and the specific household member mentioned is the younger sister.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all specific items explicitly listed in the prompt (tests, isolation instructions, duration, and the specific household member). However, it omits the safety netting/ER precautions (high fever, neurological symptoms, fainting) that the Gold Answer includes as part of the management recommendations.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript (D-44). There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question without including extraneous information."
