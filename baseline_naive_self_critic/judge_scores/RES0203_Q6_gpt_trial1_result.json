  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the clinician’s assessment that symptoms are consistent with common COVID-19 symptoms and the plan to order a COVID test via swab with results in 1–2 days and to self-isolate until results (and possibly longer if still symptomatic). However, it contains a major factual error: it states there was no mention of consulting a supervising physician, which directly contradicts the transcript (“we’ll go over this with the doctor that I’m working with today” [D-40]). It also omits the clinician’s statement that the patient otherwise seemed generally well and the closing reassurance (minor compared to the consult error).",
    "completeness": "Includes: COVID-19 swab test; isolation guidance; expected result timeline (1–2 days).\nMisses: mention of possible additional tests (“there might be a couple other tests we want to do” [D-40]); plan to review with supervising/working physician [D-40]; possible return with more questions after that review [D-40]; note that patient seemed generally well [D-16]; closing reassurance about being taken care of shortly.\nOverall, it captures some key elements but misses several required by the question (notably additional tests and supervision plan).",
    "faithfulness": "Most included points are grounded in [D-39]. But it (1) incorrectly claims no supervision consult is mentioned (contradicted by [D-40]) and (2) introduces an unverifiable “knowledge graph” justification not present in the transcript. These reduce grounding and add extraneous, unsupported content.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on assessment and management plan elements requested (tests, collection method, isolation, timeline). Minor irrelevance comes from the “knowledge graph” comment, but overall it stays on-topic."
