  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies 'pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the context of an atopic predisposition'; Generated Answer states 'Asthma, specifically exercise-induced or allergic asthma,' which is factually consistent on core diagnosis (asthma in a child with exercise and allergy triggers) but less precise in terminology (misses 'pediatric,' 'bronchoconstriction,' 'atopic predisposition'); no contradictions, minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1. exercise-triggered [P-3,P-41,P-6]; 2. episodic/reversible with rest [P-6,P-33]; 3. cold weather [P-38]; 4. multiple settings [P-38]; 5. seasonal allergies [P-35,P-36]; 6. nocturnal episode [P-43,P-44]; 7. pertinent negatives (fever [P-7], runny nose [P-8], sick contacts [P-10], phlegm [P-31]). Generated covers: exercise [P-3], cold [P-38], allergies [P-35,P-36], general symptoms [P-1,P-2]; misses reversibility with rest, multiple settings, nocturnal, negatives (~4/7 key points, 50-70%).",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims verifiable and accurate in transcript (P-1,P-2,P-3,P-35,P-36,P-38); 'Knowledge Graph' reference unverifiable in transcript but minor and does not fabricate facts; no hallucinations of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Directly names diagnosis (asthma) and lists specific transcript findings with citations supporting it, perfectly matching question's request for diagnosis and supporting evidence; no off-topic content."
