  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures some local symptoms (redness, tenderness, soreness from P-1) and location, consistent with Gold, but omits key details like 'stuck pretty good', explicit 'not the joint itself', confirmation in P-6, denial of bullseye rash, and 'totally fine' aside from tenderness. For systemic symptoms, it correctly notes joint pain (D-7) and fever/illness (D-8) screening with denials, but incorrectly states no headache screening occurred despite clear evidence in D-19/P-19/P-20, and uses indirect evidence (P-1/P-3) instead of direct denials (P-7/P-8/P-19), leading to significant factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Local - behind left knee/crease, stuck good [P-1], sore skin not joint [P-1], red/tender [P-1/P-6], no bullseye/larger circle [P-6], totally fine aside tenderness [P-18], pretty healthy [P-13]; Systemic - joint pain denied [D-7/P-7], fever/ill denied [D-8/P-8], headaches denied [D-19/P-19/P-20]. Generated covers location, redness/tenderness/soreness (partial local), joint pain/fever screening (partial systemic); misses stuck good, no bullseye, healthy/fine statements, direct denial quotes, and entirely omits headaches screening/denial. Covers ~40-50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Local symptom claims verifiable in P-1 (red, tender, sore). Systemic screenings for joint pain/fever verifiable (D-7/D-8), but denial evidence (P-1/P-3) not direct responses (actual P-7/P-8); headache claim 'does not indicate screening' directly contradicts transcript (D-19 'no headaches?' P-19 'No'); interprets denials indirectly rather than quoting direct 'No's, introducing some ungrounded interpretation/hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around local symptoms at site and systemic screenings (joint pain, fever), addressing core question; note on absent headaches is on-topic but erroneous; no major off-topic content."
