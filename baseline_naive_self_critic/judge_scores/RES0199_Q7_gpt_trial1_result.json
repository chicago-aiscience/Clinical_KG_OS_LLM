  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that headache and cough began first four days prior to the visit (consistent with [P-1]) and that loss of smell began about one day prior ([P-24]). It also correctly characterizes the cough as mostly dry ([P-12]) and the headache as persistent ([P-3]). However, it is imprecise about the gastrointestinal timing: it says GI symptoms began “a few days after” initial symptoms, while the transcript specifies diarrhea began ~2 days ago ([P-28]) and vomiting occurred yesterday with nausea today ([P-32]). This is not outright wrong but is less accurate than the Gold Answer’s timeline. It also does not correctly state the key point that both headache and cough stayed about the same severity over four days ([P-9], [P-11]).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) initial symptoms were headache and cough starting 4 days ago; (2) GI symptoms occurred later in the course (though vague); (3) loss of smell began ~1 day ago; (4) cough was dry; (5) headache was persistent. Key points missed: (a) explicit statement that headache severity stayed the same over four days ([P-9]); (b) explicit statement that cough stayed the same over four days ([P-11]); (c) specific GI chronology—diarrhea started ~2 days ago with 5–6 liquid stools/day ([P-28]), vomiting yesterday (2 episodes) and nausea today ([P-32]); (d) headache severity 7/10 and location details; (e) pertinent negatives like no fever/chills and no worsening respiratory symptoms. Overall, it captures the broad sequence but omits several timeline and severity-change details central to the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript with appropriate bracket references. The main issue is mild over-inference: it generalizes “the condition has been pretty persistent over the duration,” which is clearly true for the headache ([P-3]) but not explicitly stated for the cough (the cough is described as “around the same” [P-11]). The GI timing is also summarized vaguely (“few days after onset”), which is less precise than the transcript but not clearly contradicted. No major hallucinated symptoms are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The answer remains focused on the temporal development of symptoms and addresses the requested domains (initial symptoms, GI onset, anosmia onset, and course characteristics). However, it only partially addresses the specific prompt about how headache and cough changed/remained stable over time, so relevance is high but not perfect."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate and transcript-grounded about the initial symptoms and loss of smell, but it is vague on GI timing and misses key requested details about headache/cough stability and specific GI chronology, making it moderately complete and mostly relevant."
