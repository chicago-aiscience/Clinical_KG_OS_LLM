  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with both the source transcript and the Gold Answer regarding the events it includes (seizure, missed medication, sudden shortness of breath, and dry cough).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points present in the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the temperature check (37.4°C) which was explicitly requested in the prompt, the specific three-hour duration of symptoms mentioned in the transcript [P-11], and the contextual details of the evening before (the daughter's birthday celebration).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant to the question asked; however, it omitted one specific element required by the prompt (the temperature check) and included a point about family history that, while true, is more of a background fact than a clinical event in the timeline."
