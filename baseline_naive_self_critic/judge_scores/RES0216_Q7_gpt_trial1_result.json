  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that symptoms began ~3 days prior and involve inspiratory chest tightness, worse with walking. However, it contains significant inaccuracies relative to the Gold Answer/transcript: (1) it implies the symptoms “progressed” over the three days to include difficulty breathing, whereas the patient describes the course as steady/staying the same; the breathing difficulty is part of the initial description and remains constant. (2) It says the patient has “maintained their daily walking routine,” but the patient actually reduced from a couple of walks/day to typically one walk/day. (3) It fails to report the patient’s explicit answer that symptoms are “staying the same.” These errors affect core aspects of the asked timeline/evolution and functional impact.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: onset ~3 days; inspiratory tightness; worse on walks/dog walking. Key points missed: first noticed specifically while out on a walk (explicitly asked); explicit progression statement that it is staying the same/pretty steady; baseline “always there” with worsening on exertion; specific exacerbators (getting up from a chair, taking a big breath in); impact on routine (reduced to one walk/day from a couple); work impact (no missed work) and overall day-to-day impact framing. Overall coverage is well under 50% of required details.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not well-grounded or contradict the transcript: “progressed to include difficulty breathing” is an unsupported evolution claim; “maintained their daily walking routine” contradicts the patient’s report of fewer walks. Use of [D-34] to support onset is also imprecise (the patient already provided onset earlier). While hoarseness/phlegm is mentioned in the transcript, framing it as part of symptom evolution is interpretive and not tied to the question asked. Multiple key claims are thus unfaithful to the source.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly on-topic (onset, triggers, impact), but includes tangential content (asthma vs cardiac differential) and fails to address several specific elements explicitly requested (better/worse/same; specific exacerbating situations; walking routine reduction). Thus it only partially answers the question."
