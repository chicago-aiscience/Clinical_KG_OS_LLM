  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer: diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), physical exam (chest-focused), self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate), source (doctor for isolation, public health nurse for positive results instructions), timeline (24-48 hours), and criteria (based on results including physical exam). No contradictions or errors; minor rephrasing like including physical exam explicitly in criteria is consistent with transcript context [D-37, D-38] and Gold's implication.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer fully covered: comprehensive plan citation [D-37], physical exam details, both tests with purposes implied, exact self-isolation phrasing and source, timeline, nurse role, disposition criteria (contingent on results, no thresholds noted implicitly). Covers 100% including progression to exam.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-37]: tests ('chest X Ray... covid swab'), physical exam ('have a look at your chest and do a physical exam'), isolation ('stay away from everyone, so including your wife. Try to self isolate'), timeline ('24 to 48 hours'), nurse ('public health nurse should tell you'), criteria ('decide whether you need to stay... based on those results'). Inclusion of physical exam in criteria is supported by sequence ('do physical exam... go from there' [D-37, D-38]); no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured as a bulleted list directly matching the question's elements (tests, exam, isolation/from whom, timeline, criteria), with no tangents or extraneous content; perfectly focused on the management plan from the transcript."
