  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists specific endorsed symptoms: worsening cough over week beyond COPD baseline with triggers (stairs), increased SOB last few days severe on short walks, sputum clear-to-white to yellow, chest discomfort on coughing, chills last couple days no measured fever. Generated correctly notes SOB worsening few days [P-1,P-8 partial], chronic cough increased week [P-1 partial], sputum change [P-6 ok minor phrasing]. Errors: Misclassifies high cholesterol [P-33] and past BP meds [P-34] as 'systemic symptoms endorsed' (these are history, not symptoms); misses chest discomfort [P-13], chills [P-29]; wrongly claims NO explicit denials for orthopnea [P-9], PND [P-10], palpitations [P-14], hemoptysis [P-7 explicit 'No'], fever (implied no measured). Significant contradictions on denials and omissions. Score: 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Endorsed - worsening cough details/triggers, SOB details/severity, sputum change, chest discomfort, chills/no fever measure; Negatives - hemoptysis, orthopnea, PND, palpitations, plus long list (calf pain etc.). Generated covers partial SOB, partial cough, sputum change (~25% endorsed); misses cough triggers, chest discomfort, chills, all negatives (claims absent). Adds irrelevant history. Covers 20-49%. Score: 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: SOB [P-1,P-8], cough [P-1], sputum [P-6]. Citations accurate. Unverifiable/hallucinated: 'Systemic symptoms' as high cholesterol/BP history (in transcript but not symptoms); 'transcript does not contain explicit denials' for orthopnea/PND/palpitations/hemoptysis/fever - contradicted by [P-7 no blood, P-9 no SOB laying, P-10 no PND, P-14 no palpitations]; implies no hemoptysis only by yellow sputum (ignores direct denial). Multiple misreads/hallucinations on denials. Score: 2.",
    "relevance": "Structure addresses respiratory/systemic endorsed, sputum change, denials per question. But partial coverage, adds off-topic history as 'symptoms', wrongly dismisses denials core to question (e.g., orthopnea/PND/hemoptysis/palpitations explicitly listed). Partially relevant with off-topic/misguided content. Score: 3."
