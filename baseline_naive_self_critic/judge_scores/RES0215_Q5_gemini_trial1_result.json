  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer makes a significant factual error by stating that the recurrent viral infections over the past two years were 'associated with the wheezy symptoms currently being reported.' In the transcript, the parent explicitly states at [P-4] that the child has never had symptoms like this before, and [P-15] describes the past infections as having 'come and go' without mention of wheezing. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these infections as risk factors for developing hyperresponsiveness rather than symptoms themselves.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all four specific factors mentioned in the question (allergies, infections, carpets, weather). However, it lacks the depth of the Gold Answer, which connects these factors to the clinical concepts of 'atopic constitution' and 'bronchospasm.' It also misses the negative environmental findings (smoking, pets) that the Gold Answer includes to complete the patient's environmental profile.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer includes a hallucinated tag '[KG]' which is not present in the source. It also misinterprets the history of viral infections as being symptomatic of wheezing, which contradicts the transcript at [P-4].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing each component of the multi-part question and organizing them clearly."
