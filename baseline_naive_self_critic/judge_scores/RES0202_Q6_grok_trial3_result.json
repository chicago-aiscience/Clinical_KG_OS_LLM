  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript, including assessment as compatible with COVID/infection, COVID swab with 24-48 hour TAT, 14-day isolation including sister, false negative possibility, alternative viral illness, and exact warning signs (high temp, seizures, weak, dizzy, fainting). No errors or contradictions; minor interpretive wording like 'strict' isolation is not discrepant.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key Gold points: assessment [D-44,D-45], test/TAT [D-44], isolation [D-44], false neg [D-44], alt dx [D-44], warning signs fully listed [D-44]. Misses Gold's explicit mention of asthma differential if no fever [D-45] and no meds/watchful waiting, covering ~85-90% of Gold's content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [D-44, D-45]; warning signs match verbatim phrasing (e.g., 'really high temperature', 'neurological symptoms, like seizures', 'feeling weak, dizzy', 'fainting spells'). No hallucinations; intro mention of 'knowledge graph' is extraneous but does not introduce ungrounded facts.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's elements (assessment/plan, test/TAT, isolation, alt dx/false neg, warning signs with examples); no off-topic content, uses clear headings and bullets for focus."
