  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the timeline in the transcript and aligns with the Gold Answer: cough began Wednesday night as a mild dry cough; on Thursday the cough persisted/worsened and the child was very tired; on Friday the cough worsened further and fever was noted >100°F, along with decreased appetite and possible loss of taste. No statements contradict the transcript or Gold Answer. Minor limitation: it does not explicitly state the fever was appearing for the first time on Friday (though this is strongly implied).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Wednesday evening onset of mild dry cough; (2) Thursday cough persisted/worsened + tiredness; (3) Friday cough worsened + fever >100; (4) decreased appetite and possible taste change noted Friday. Key points missed or under-specified versus Gold Answer: (a) mild runny nose mentioned in transcript; (b) fatigue on Friday (Gold emphasizes systemic symptoms apparent on Friday; Generated Answer only ties “really tired” to Thursday); (c) more specific fever range (100.1 vs 101); (d) explicit mention that mother corrected the doctor’s “5 days” to “3 days”; (e) explicit inclusion of the mother’s stepwise summary statement (P-12). Overall, it captures most but not all of the Gold Answer’s details.",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are supported by the transcript (cough onset Wednesday night; worsening Thursday and Friday; fever on Friday over 100; decreased appetite and suspected taste change). No clear hallucinations or extra unsupported symptoms are introduced. Citations are generally consistent with the transcript content, though decreased appetite is supported by P-15 as well as P-17.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by describing day-by-day evolution from Wednesday evening through Friday, focusing on cough onset and worsening, fever timing, and new symptoms (appetite/taste). No notable tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is accurate and well-focused, covering the main day-by-day progression but missing a few specific symptoms and clarifying details present in the Gold Answer (e.g., runny nose, explicit 3-day correction, and fuller Friday systemic symptom detail)."
