  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details precise chronology: sore throat Day 1 (worsening over 4 days), muscle aches/fatigue shortly after, taste Day 3 (constant, new), breathing Day 4 (constant, worsening, new). Generated Answer correctly identifies sore throat onset 4 days ago and partial severity, vaguely notes new/worsening yesterday (breathing), mentions aches and taste but assigns them to 'current status' without correct timings; misses explicit worsening trajectories, fatigue distinction, self-treatment failure, and overall progression; significant factual errors in symptom timelines and severity changes.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: sore throat onset/worsening/swallowing (covered partially), aches/fatigue timing/details (missed timing, partial mention), taste timing/details/no smell loss (missed timing/details), breathing details (vague partial), self-treatment (missed), progressive trajectory (missed). Covers sore throat ~50%, breathing vaguely, aches/taste minimally; ~20-49% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims verifiable: sore throat/swallowing [P-2], concerned [P-8], aches [P-25], taste/smell [P-19]; inference 'likely difficulty breathing' grounded in explicit [P-7/P-8]; minor interpretive vagueness on 'new symptom or worsening' and COVID context [D-43], but no hallucinations; mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly attempts chronological symptom order and severity (sore throat onset, yesterday worsening, current symptoms), but incomplete chronology, missing severity changes for most symptoms, and inaccurate groupings; partially addresses question without off-topic content."
