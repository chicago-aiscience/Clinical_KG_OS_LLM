  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core facts from the Gold Answer, including hiking on Friday and gardening on Saturday [P-1], uncertainty about attachment timing with hope it was from hiking [P-1], bringing the tick in a container [P-1], doctor's estimate of >72 hours attachment [D-6], prior tick bite ~10 years ago with bullseye rash and antibiotics [P-3], comparison of prior 'quite swollen' tick vs current 'pretty small'/'little bit' engorged [P-3, P-4], and current localized redness/tenderness without bullseye rash [P-1, P-6]. Minor discrepancies include omission of exact discovery details ('earlier today' due to soreness prompting inspection, precise knee crease location in timeline) and doctor's 'little grape' engorgement confirmation [D-4], but no contradictions or errors in stated facts. Score: 4",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: hiking Fri/garden Sat [100%], uncertainty/hope from hiking [100%], brought tick in container [100%], >72h estimate [100%], prior ~10y bullseye/antibiotics [100%], engorgement contrast (prior swollen vs current small/not as much) [100%], current local red/tender no circle rash [100%]. Missed: explicit 'discovered earlier today' due to back-of-knee soreness leading to inspection [partial via soreness mention], embedded in knee joint crease [mentioned but not tied precisely to discovery], doctor's 'grape' confirmation [omitted]. Covers ~85-90% of details. Score: 4",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1] for activities/uncertainty/location/symptoms, [P-3] for prior experience/comparison, [P-6] for no rash, [D-6] for 72h/prophylaxis). No hallucinations; minor additions like prophylactic antibiotics are grounded [D-6]. Fully grounded. Score: 5",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question's two parts with dedicated sections on timeline (exposure Friday-Saturday to discovery/presentation) and symptom/engorgement comparison to prior episode; extra prophylaxis context is minor and clinically relevant, no off-topic content. Score: 5"
