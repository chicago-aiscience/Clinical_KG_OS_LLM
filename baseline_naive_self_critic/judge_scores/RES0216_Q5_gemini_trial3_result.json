  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the core relationship: the patient's history of asthma and self-directed medication reduction (skipping doses/not refilling) likely led to the current symptoms, which the doctor assesses as recurring asthma. It accurately cites the doctor's leading differential diagnosis. However, it misattributes the observation 'harder to get a whole breath' to D-36 (where the doctor actually notes the patient did NOT seem out of breath to rule out cardiac issues), whereas the patient reported this in P-7.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main points but misses some specific clinical details present in the Gold Answer, such as the increased phlegm and hoarseness (P-11), the patient's specific observation that this episode feels 'different' from previous ones (P-16), and the doctor's specific immediate plan to provide rescue puffers (D-35).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally grounded in the transcript. However, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' which is external to the provided text. It also simplifies the medication non-adherence (skipping the evening dose) into a general 'limiting' of medication, though this is supported by D-34.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question, breaking down the relationship between history, medication behavior, and the new onset of symptoms in a logical structure."
