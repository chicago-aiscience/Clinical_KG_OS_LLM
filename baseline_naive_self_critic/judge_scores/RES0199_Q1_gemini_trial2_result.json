  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is highly inaccurate. It explicitly states that the transcript does not specify the frequency of diarrhea, the number of vomiting episodes, or a numerical severity scale for the headache. However, the transcript clearly states the diarrhea occurred 'five or six times a day' [P-28], the patient 'vomited two times' [P-32], and the headache severity was a '7' out of 10 [P-8].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide three out of the four specific characteristics requested by the prompt (frequency, count, and severity rating). It only successfully identifies the nature of the cough as 'dry'.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates a lack of information within the source text. Claiming that specific data points are missing when they are explicitly present constitutes a failure in grounding/faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in that it follows the structure of the question and attempts to address each point, even though the content provided for those points is incorrect."
