  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details specific infectious screening symptoms (colds/infections, loss of taste/smell, fevers, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, dry cough) and exposures (sick contacts at home/frequent, outside home, travel), all denied by patient, with planned COVID swab. Generated Answer incorrectly focuses on asthma triggers (cold weather, pollen, pets, exercise, wheezing) as 'screening to distinguish from infection', which are unrelated to infectious causes; misstates planned test as bronchodilator increase instead of COVID swab; entirely factually inaccurate and contradictory.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: symptoms screened (recent colds/infections, taste/smell loss, fevers, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, dry cough) with denials; exposures (home/frequent contacts sick, outside contacts sick, travel) with denials; purpose explanation; COVID swab planned despite negatives. Generated covers 0% of these, instead listing irrelevant asthma triggers and wrong test.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites transcript sections (P-9, P-11, P-39, etc.) but fabricates that they represent infectious screening (they are asthma/environmental triggers); hallucinates 'negative screening for infection not captured' when explicit screening is in D-21 to D-28; wrongly claims bronchodilator as planned diagnostic test (not a test, and not planned as such); largely ungrounded and fabricated claims about purpose.",
    "relevance": "Question asks specifically for infectious/COVID screening symptoms/exposures/responses and planned diagnostic test (COVID swab); Generated addresses unrelated asthma triggers and treatment, claiming falsely they rule out infection; does not address the question."
