  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the main symptoms: persistent dry cough (current), early productive cough with mucus, sore throat, runny nose (resolved), and chest soreness/pain with coughing. Minor discrepancies include referring to chest soreness as 'chest pain' (patient said 'hurts a little bit,' Gold distinguishes as soreness not independent pain) and grouping mucus under flu-like without specifying 'whitish clear' or exact timelines (2-3 days sore throat, couple days runny nose, 4-5 days mucus), but core facts align with Gold and transcript without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: persistent cough [P-2], dry cough now [P-5,6], early mucus/productive cough [P-5,6,14], sore throat [P-13,14], runny nose [P-14], flu symptoms resolved early except cough [P-14], chest soreness with coughing [P-15,16]. Missed: precise timelines (2-3/3-4/4-5 days), cough frequency (3-4x/hour), spontaneous/no triggers, stable intensity/frequency, denial of independent chest pain, pertinent negatives (no SOB, fever, N/V, abd pain). Covers ~70% of detailed key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: cough details [P-2,5,6], chest [P-15,16], resolved flu-like incl. sore throat/runny nose/mucus [P-14,13,5,6]. No hallucinations or unverifiable additions; interpretations (e.g., mucus correlating with early phase) grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response around current vs. resolved symptoms for the two-week illness, directly matching the question with no off-topic content or tangents."
