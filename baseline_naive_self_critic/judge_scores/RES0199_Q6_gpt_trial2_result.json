  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All core elements match the Gold Answer: COVID-19 swab ordered, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, and supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). No contradictory or incorrect clinical details were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key management points (test type, isolation duration, contact tracing trigger, supportive care items, and acknowledgement of possible non-COVID viral illness). However, it omits the explicitly stated expected test turnaround time (“about 24–48 hours”), which is part of the complete plan in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are grounded in [D-52]. The added “Knowledge Graph confirms…” parentheticals are not present in the transcript and are therefore unverifiable additions (though they don’t materially change the plan).",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question components (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing condition, supportive care recommendations) without meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "The generated answer is accurate and highly relevant, capturing nearly all plan elements, but it misses the 24–48 hour result timeframe and includes minor unverifiable “knowledge graph” additions."
