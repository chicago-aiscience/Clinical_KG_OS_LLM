  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key facts from the Gold Answer. Both identify the same physical examination components (heart and lungs auscultation, quick physical exam) and describe the same collaborative process (consult with supervising physician, review discussion, return to discuss next steps). The Generated Answer correctly cites [D-37] as the primary source. No factual errors or contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the core elements but lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer. It omits: (1) the foreshadowing at [D-1], (2) patient agreement at [P-37], (3) the observation that no diagnosis or medication was provided at this stage, (4) the interpretation that this indicates a learner/trainee consulting a supervisor, and (5) the note that the transcript ends before exam findings or treatment. These omissions represent approximately 30-35% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-37]. The citation is accurate, and there is no hallucinated content. The answer stays grounded in what was explicitly stated by the doctor without adding unverifiable interpretations or fabricated details.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: what physical examination was specified, and what process was described for determining next steps. It is well-focused with clear organization under the two main question components. No irrelevant content is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and well-focused, correctly identifying the physical examination components (heart and lungs auscultation) and the collaborative consultation process described by the doctor. All information is properly grounded in the transcript with accurate citation. However, it lacks contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including the foreshadowing at the consultation's beginning, patient agreement, and interpretive notes about the clinical training context and what was not provided. The answer covers approximately 65-70% of the Gold Answer's key points while maintaining perfect accuracy in what it does include."
