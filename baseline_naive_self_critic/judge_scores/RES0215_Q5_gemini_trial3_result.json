  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the role of seasonal allergies, viral infections, carpets, and cold weather. It accurately maps the symptoms (wheezing, shortness of breath) and triggers (activity, cold) mentioned in the transcript. It matches the Gold Answer's interpretation that these factors create a baseline of vulnerability/susceptibility.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all four specific factors requested in the prompt. However, it is slightly less comprehensive than the Gold Answer in its clinical synthesis. The Gold Answer explicitly connects the factors to an 'atopic constitution' and 'airway hyperresponsiveness,' providing a more technical medical explanation of 'how' they collectively relate. The generated answer also omits the negative environmental findings (no smoking, no pets) that the Gold Answer included to round out the patient's profile.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. All claims regarding the patient's symptoms and history are traceable to the provided turns (e.g., P-1, P-3, P-15, P-35, P-38, P-54). There is a minor use of a non-standard citation tag [KG], but the information itself is grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, focusing specifically on the four items mentioned in the question and their relationship to the current respiratory issues."
