  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately reflects the transcript and Gold Answer: hiking Friday and gardening Saturday with uncertainty about when the tick attached; discovery and removal followed by bringing the tick in a plastic container; clinician’s estimate that it may have been attached >72 hours and discussion of prophylactic antibiotics; comparison to a prior tick bite ~10 years ago with a bullseye/target rash requiring antibiotics; prior tick described as quite swollen vs current tick only minimally swollen with localized redness/tenderness and no bullseye rash. No clear factual contradictions were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: Friday hike (and Saturday gardening), uncertainty of attachment source, discovery prompted by soreness behind left knee, removal and bringing tick in container, clinician’s >72-hour estimate, prior bullseye rash and antibiotics, and current lack of bullseye with localized tenderness/redness.\nMissed/underemphasized details: the answer does not explicitly state the tick was discovered “earlier today,” and it does not clearly include the “pretty small” characterization (and the explicit contrast to a ‘little grape’ engorged tick) that the Gold Answer highlights. Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Statements are grounded in the transcript (with the same wording/themes: unsure timing, hiking/gardening, red/tender behind knee, prior target rash and antibiotics, prior tick swollen, current only slightly swollen, clinician’s >72h inference). No notable hallucinations or extraneous clinical claims beyond what was said.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what was asked: (1) the timeline from hiking/gardening to discovery/removal/presentation, and (2) comparison of current symptoms and engorgement versus the prior episode with bullseye rash and antibiotics. No significant tangents."
