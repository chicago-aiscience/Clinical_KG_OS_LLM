  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies some reported symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, feeling crappy, headache) matching Gold [P-1, P-2, P-4], but misses key ones like feeling 'really hot' day and night [P-7, P-9], tiredness [P-13], and malaise [P-14, D-15]. For denials, it incorrectly states no explicit mentions of denying sputum production (directly denied [P-5, P-6]), rashes/skin changes ([P-10]), nausea/vomiting ([P-11]), diarrhea ([P-12]), and misinterprets joint pain denial [P-13] while claiming others absent. Significant factual contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key reported points from Gold: dry cough/scratchy throat (covered), headache (covered), feeling crappy/icky/malaise (partially covered as 'crappy'), feeling hot (missed), tired (missed). Key denied: sputum/phlegm (missed), rashes (missed), nausea/vomiting (missed), diarrhea (missed), joint aches (partially as pain denial), breathing issues (missed). Covers ~4/12 key points (~33%), score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms verifiable in transcript [P-1 etc.]. Denial of hurting [P-13] verifiable but oddly interpreted. However, claims 'no explicit mentions' of denials for sputum [P-5/P-6 'No', 'no nothing'], rashes [P-10 'I don't think so'], nausea [P-11 'No'], etc., are false and not grounded—hallucinated absences contradict transcript. Multiple ungrounded claims, score 2.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response around reported symptoms over 3-4 days and denied symptoms, addressing the question with sections for each, no off-topic content, score 5."
