  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer correctly identifies the three symptom categories (smell change, taste change, mild dry cough) and correctly characterizes the smell deficit as partial. However, it contains a major factual error: it states the patient had a **complete** loss of taste, whereas the transcript/Gold Answer indicate **partial** loss (can still taste very salty foods but not “normal” foods like banana). The cough description as mild and dry is accurate, but other accurate specifics from the Gold Answer (non-productive/no blood, onset timing, consistency) are omitted rather than contradicted.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) decreased smell (partial), (2) taste change (but degree incorrectly stated), (3) mild dry cough.\nKey points missed: (a) smell specifics—can still smell very strong unpleasant odors; (b) taste specifics—can still taste very salty foods, cannot taste normal foods like banana; (c) all symptoms present for two days; (d) sensory symptoms consistent over two days; (e) cough started at same time as sensory symptoms; (f) cough non-productive with no sputum/blood; (g) cough consistent/not worsening; (h) no identified cough triggers. Overall, it captures only a minority of the detailed elements requested (especially the “what could/could not perceive” details).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript and cited appropriately. The major unfaithful element is the claim of **complete** loss of taste, which is not supported by the transcript (patient explicitly retained taste for very salty foods). This is a meaningful distortion of symptom degree.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the patient’s sensory and respiratory symptoms and attempts to describe degree/severity; no notable irrelevant content. However, it under-delivers on the requested detail."
