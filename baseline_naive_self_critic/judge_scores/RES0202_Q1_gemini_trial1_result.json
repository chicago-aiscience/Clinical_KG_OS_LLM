  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error. It claims that 'None of the specific symptoms listed in your example (wheezing, sore throat, chest pain, chills, or GI complaints) were explicitly asked about by the doctor.' However, the transcript shows the doctor explicitly asking about wheezing [D-7], chest pain [D-13], sore throat [D-14], chills [D-19], and GI complaints [D-22, D-23]. The mother denied all of these. The first part of the answer regarding reported symptoms is mostly correct.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide the list of denied symptoms requested in the prompt. While it lists the reported symptoms, it completely misses the pertinent negatives (denied symptoms) because it incorrectly asserts they were never asked about.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that the doctor did not ask specific questions which are clearly present in the transcript. It also refers to a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the provided context. It incorrectly identifies the source of the dizziness/fainting discussion as the doctor's closing advice [D-44] instead of the initial history taking where they were asked and denied [D-25, P-25].",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it addresses the first half of the prompt (reported symptoms). However, it fails to address the second half of the prompt accurately, providing a false negative response to the question regarding specific denied symptoms."
