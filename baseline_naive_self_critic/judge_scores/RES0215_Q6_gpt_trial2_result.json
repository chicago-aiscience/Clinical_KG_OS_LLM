  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s central claim—that the doctor’s plan for next steps is “not included”—is factually incorrect. In [D-58], the doctor explicitly states the plan: (1) do a physical exam, (2) go talk to the physician, and (3) return to discuss next steps. The environmental factors section is partly correct (townhouse, new carpets, cold weather trigger is mentioned), but it omits several key home-environment items the doctor assessed (smoking exposure, pets, wood-burning sources, air filter changes). Including “colder weather” as a home environmental factor is also a mismatch with the question’s focus on in-home exposures (though it is in the transcript as a trigger).",
    "completeness": "Misses essentially all of the Gold Answer’s ‘plan/next steps’ elements (physical exam, consult supervising physician, return to discuss plan, offer for questions). For environmental assessment, it captures only a subset (housing type, carpets) and adds cold weather (trigger, not in-home factor); it omits smoking, pets, wood-burning stove/fireplace, air filter change, and household composition/exposure context.",
    "faithfulness": "Some statements are grounded (cold weather worse [P-38], townhouse [P-50], new carpets ~6 months [P-54]). However, the statement that no next-step plan was documented contradicts the transcript directly ([D-58] contains the plan), which is a major faithfulness failure. No clear fabricated details beyond that contradiction.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally aimed at the asked topics (next steps and environmental factors), but it fails to provide the actual next-step plan and provides an incomplete set of home environmental factors, so it only partially addresses the question."
