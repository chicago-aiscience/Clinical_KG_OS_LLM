  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer. All mentioned events (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday, uncertainty on attachment, >72 hours estimate [D-6], prior bullseye rash and antibiotics ~10 years ago [P-3], current tick small/not as engorged [P-3,P-4], localized redness/tenderness without bullseye [P-1,P-6]) match exactly. Minor citation imprecision (no rash cited as [P-1][P-6], though P-6 supports it) does not introduce errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: hiking Fri/gardening Sat [P-1], uncertain timing/hope from hiking [P-1], brought tick in container [P-1], >72h [D-6], prior bullseye/abx [P-3], prior swollen tick vs current less so [P-3,P-4], current no circle rash [P-6], location/tenderness [P-1]. Missed or underdeveloped: discovery 'earlier today' prompted by soreness [P-1], precise knee crease location in timeline (mentioned in symptoms), doctor's 'not engorged grape' confirmation [D-4], hiking in Strathroy [P-12]; covers ~85% of details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1] for activities/location/symptoms, [P-3] for prior experience/comparison, [D-6] for 72h, [P-6] for no rash). No hallucinations; minor citation overlap ([P-1][P-6] for rash) but content grounded. Prophylactic mention tied to [D-6].",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question on timeline (Fri hike, Sat garden, discovery/presentation) and comparison (current local symptoms/small tick vs prior bullseye/swollen tick/abx). Structured response with sections; minor inclusion of prophylactic discussion directly relates to timeline implications."
