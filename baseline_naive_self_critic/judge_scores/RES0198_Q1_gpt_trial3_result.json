  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies the main nasal symptoms (stuffy nose/on-and-off and runny nose for ~1 week) and notes the progression from initial stuffiness to mostly running, which matches [P-1, P-3]. However, it omits the key detail that the discharge was “mostly clear” [P-5] and instead discusses only that it is running. Most importantly, it incorrectly claims there were no explicit denials of sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, fever/chills, or loss of taste/smell—these were explicitly denied by the patient ([P-4], [P-7], [P-16]). This directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer and undermines the core of the question.",
    "completeness": "Covered: nasal congestion and rhinorrhea for ~1 week; initial stuffy then mostly running; mentions symptom localization to the nose [P-6].\nMissed: clear character of discharge [P-5]; explicit denials of cough [P-4], sore throat/SOB/fever/chills [P-7], post-nasal drip/back-of-throat drainage [P-6], and loss of taste/smell [P-16]. Also does not include mild fatigue [P-15] or other pertinent negatives listed in the Gold Answer (though those are less central to the question). Overall, it captures well under half of the key requested elements (especially the explicit denials).",
    "faithfulness": "While most statements are drawn from the transcript, there are notable unfaithful elements: (1) the claim that the transcript lacks explicit denials of cough/sore throat/SOB/fever/chills/taste-smell is demonstrably false given [P-4], [P-7], and [P-16]; (2) the phrasing that the runny nose has been mostly running “since the beginning” is not accurate (the patient said it started stuffy and is now mostly running [P-3]). These represent multiple contradictions to the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is on-topic (nasal symptoms, discharge, denied associated symptoms) but fails to actually list the explicitly denied related symptoms requested and instead incorrectly states they were not explicitly denied. This makes it only partially responsive to the question."
