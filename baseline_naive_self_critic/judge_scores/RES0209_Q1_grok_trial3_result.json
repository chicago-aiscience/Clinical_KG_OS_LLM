  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the dry cough (nonstop daytime, P-1), shortness of breath (P-1), wheezing (a lot, P-15), and daytime vs. nighttime frequency differences (P-18), with no contradictions to the Gold Answer or transcript. However, it has minor discrepancies: omits cough duration (~2 weeks, P-13), full breathing difficulty details ('hard time breathing,' P-19), wheezing occurring more frequently than bronchodilator use (P-17), and chest tightness (P-20), which are explicitly noted in the Gold Answer as key symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: dry cough character and daytime frequency (nonstop, P-1); shortness of breath (P-1); prominent wheezing (P-15); daytime symptoms prominent (P-1, P-9); nighttime less frequent (every other/every two days, P-18). Missed: cough duration (2 weeks, P-13); detailed breathing difficulty ('hard time breathing' during episodes, P-19); wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use (P-17); chest tightness (P-20). Covers approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: cough details (P-1, P-11), shortness of breath and bronchodilator (P-1), wheezing (P-15, P-18), daytime frequency including gym trigger (P-1, P-9), nighttime frequency (P-18). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; minor interpretation of cold air as cough-specific trigger is plausible and grounded in P-11.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question's focus on symptoms (cough character, breathing difficulties, wheezing) and day/night frequency differences, structured clearly around these. Minor tangents include bronchodilator use frequency and specific triggers (cold air, gym), which are related but not core to the question; chest sensations omitted but otherwise perfectly focused."
