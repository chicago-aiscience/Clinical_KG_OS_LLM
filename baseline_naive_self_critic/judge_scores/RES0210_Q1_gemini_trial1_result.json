  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate based on the transcript. It correctly identifies the cough, the appearance of the sputum, the location of the chest pain, and the presence of chills. There are no contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete compared to the Gold Answer and the specific prompts in the question. It misses the quality of the chest pain (dull, constant, worse with deep breaths), which was explicitly requested. It also misses the reported fever (only mentioning chills), the mild dyspnea on exertion, the sore throat, the history of a runny nose, and the temporal details of the cough progression (starting Friday/Sunday).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, using direct quotes and accurate descriptions for the points it does include. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and addresses the prompt directly, although it fails to provide the full detail requested in the parenthetical instructions of the question."
