  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies the hiking trip two weeks ago with the partner, where people brushed by them (P-18, P-19), as the specific potential exposure event in the context of limited outings. The Generated Answer explicitly states 'The patient did not explicitly identify a specific potential exposure event' and claims no description of a specific event, which directly contradicts the Gold Answer and transcript (P-18). Additional errors include labeling partial loss of taste/smell as 'ageusia,' referencing a non-existent 'knowledge graph,' and emphasizing symptoms over exposure history, whereas Gold connects the limited exposure to COVID suspicion. This represents mostly incorrect content contradicting the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers: high school online (P-36/37), not out of house (D-38/P-38), hiking exposure details (P-18/19), no other sources/known sick (P-17/18), household (P-29), immunizations (P-20), testing due to symptoms (D-39). Generated Answer covers none of these exposure-related points, only vaguely notes symptoms and doctor's testing (D-39), missing >80% of key points including the core hiking event.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims no specific exposure identified, but P-18 directly states the hiking with brushing by people as potential source ('I guess there were some people... I don't see where else'). 'Knowledge graph' is hallucinated/not in transcript. Partial anosmia/ageusia misrepresented as full 'ageusia.' Citations to P-1 and D-39 accurate but insufficient; multiple ungrounded claims.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for specific exposure event identified (hiking) and connection to COVID diagnosis given homebound status. Generated structures response around identification (denies it) and connection (via symptoms), but ignores/misses exposure focus, adds irrelevant 'knowledge graph'; partially relevant but off-topic in denial and shift to symptoms only."
