  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error by stating that the transcript does not include the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea. In reality, these are explicitly asked about in turns D-16, D-17, D-10, and D-15 respectively. It also incorrectly lists cough, appetite, and taste as 'negated' or 'denied' symptoms, whereas the patient actually reports a lack of appetite, loss of taste, and a developing cough.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several negated symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as vision/hearing changes, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and neurological symptoms (numbness/tingling). It only attempts to discuss the symptoms specifically highlighted in the prompt's parenthetical, and even then, fails to find them in the text.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly on faithfulness by claiming the requested symptoms are absent from the transcript when they are clearly present. This is a hallucination of absence. It also misrepresents the patient's reports on taste and appetite as 'denials' rather than positive symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the 'differentiation' part of the question with logical medical reasoning, but because it begins with the false premise that the symptoms weren't in the transcript, it fails to directly answer the first part of the question accurately (which symptoms were asked about). It provides an answer to why their absence matters, but misses the core task of identifying them in the text provided. It also includes irrelevant details about a 'Knowledge Graph' not provided in the context segment provided to the evaluator (though likely part of the model's internal processing).\", \"average_score\": 1.75, \"summary\": \"The Generated Answer is highly inaccurate as it incorrectly claims the transcript does not contain the specific symptoms mentioned, despite them being clearly documented in the source text.\""
