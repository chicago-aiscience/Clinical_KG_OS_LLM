  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two key risk factors: medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose) and hereditary predisposition (maternal epilepsy). The citations are accurate [P-9, P-26, P-8]. The facts align with the Gold Answer without contradictions. The Generated Answer mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is not present in the evaluation materials, but this doesn't affect factual accuracy regarding the transcript content.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points: (1) missed medication as precipitating factor, (2) maternal family history of epilepsy, and (3) the relationship between family history and diagnosis. However, it lacks several details present in the Gold Answer: the specific medication name (Keppra mentioned in P-23), the contextual explanation about the daughter's birthday disrupting routine [P-24], the patient's acknowledgment that seizures are normally infrequent when medicated [P-9], and the detail about dinner-time dosing routine. It covers approximately 70-75% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The reference to a 'knowledge graph' suggests the answer may have been generated using additional structured data, but the core claims about the transcript content (missed medication, family history, patient statements) are all grounded in the provided transcript. No hallucinated clinical facts are present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) what hereditary and medication-related risk factors contributed to the seizure, and (2) how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. The structure explicitly separates these components and provides a clear 'Relationship between Family History and Diagnosis' section. All content is directly relevant to the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies both key risk factors (medication non-adherence and hereditary predisposition) with accurate citations and no factual errors. It directly addresses all parts of the question with highly relevant content. However, it lacks contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the daughter's birthday disrupting the medication routine, the specific timing of the dose, and the patient's acknowledgment of normally infrequent seizures when compliant. The reference to a 'knowledge graph' suggests use of supplementary data sources not provided in the evaluation materials, though this doesn't introduce inaccuracies. The answer would be strengthened by including more of the contextual details that explain the medication non-adherence."
