  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer (GA) correctly identifies the core diagnosis (asthma exacerbation). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the source text: it claims chest tightness is not explicitly cited in the transcript, but the patient explicitly confirms it in [P-20]. Additionally, the GA fails to include the specific numerical increase in inhaler use (once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week) which was provided in the prompt and confirmed in [P-8].",
    "completeness": "The GA misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention the patient's history of being diagnosed at age eight [P-2]. 2) It omits the critical reasoning for why this is NOT a new respiratory condition (the negative screening for infections like fever, travel, and sick contacts [P-21 to P-28]). 3) It misses the observation that wheezing occurs even more frequently than bronchodilator use [P-17].",
    "faithfulness": "The GA is mostly faithful, but it hallucinates a negative—claiming a symptom (chest tightness) is missing from the transcript when it is present. Other citations ([P-1], [P-15], [P-9], [P-11], [P-32]) are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The GA directly addresses the question and uses the provided framework (symptoms, medication use) to support its conclusion, though it lacks the comparative depth of the Gold Answer regarding 'new respiratory conditions'."
