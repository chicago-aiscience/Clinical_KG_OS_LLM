    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the core information in the gold answer. It correctly identifies the current dry cough, the chest soreness related to coughing, and the resolved symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, and mucus).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main categories of symptoms but misses significant details provided in the gold answer, including: specific timelines for individual symptoms (e.g., sore throat for 2-3 days, mucus for 4-5 days), the character of the mucus (whitish clear), the frequency of the cough (3-4 times per hour), the lack of triggers, the stable intensity/frequency of the cough, and all pertinent negatives (fever, difficulty breathing, GI symptoms).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. Every symptom mentioned is correctly attributed and supported by the provided speaker turns.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is entirely relevant to the question, focusing specifically on the reported symptoms without including extraneous information about medical history or social factors."
