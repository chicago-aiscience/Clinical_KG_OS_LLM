  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is entirely incorrect. It claims that the transcript ends at [P-27] and that doctor turns are missing, whereas the provided source transcript continues until [P-48] and includes all necessary doctor turns ([D-47], [D-48]) to answer the question. It asserts that the information is unavailable when it is clearly present.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the doctor's summary of the three-month cough, the plan to review the case with supervising physicians, or the absence of constitutional symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the provided source transcript. It hallucinates a limitation in the data (claiming the transcript is missing parts) that does not exist in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is not relevant as it fails to answer the specific questions asked, instead providing a meta-commentary about supposed missing data."
