  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the two proposed procedures (chest X-ray and COVID swab) matching the Gold Answer, with correct citations [D-37, D-39]. The rationale for the COVID swab is faithfully quoted and paraphrased as standard protocol for patients with these symptoms, aligning perfectly with the Gold's description of institutional protocol rather than unique suspicion. Minor rephrasing like 'examine the lungs' is consistent with the context of cough and chest X-ray purpose [D-37]. No factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: two procedures (chest X-ray [D-37] and COVID swab [D-39]); specific rationale for swab as protocol for anyone with symptoms [D-39]. Partially covers explanations (better look internally). Missed: explicit no meds/history confirmation [D-27/P-27, P-24/P-26], full patient explanations (picture inside [D-39]), discomfort acknowledgment, reassurance, arrangement/plan details [D-40], and note on no treatments. Covers core ~85% of question-relevant points but misses supportive details (~80-99%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims grounded: chest X-ray proposal and description verifiable [D-37, D-39]; COVID swab and exact rationale quote [D-39]; coughing symptoms [P-2]. 'Examine the lungs' is plausible inference from chest X-ray for cough context. Minor unverifiable: 'knowledge graph' not in transcript (likely extraneous phrasing). No hallucinations; citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing proposed procedures and providing the specific rationale for the COVID swab with transcript support. Structured response (procedures then rationale) is perfectly focused, no off-topic content."
