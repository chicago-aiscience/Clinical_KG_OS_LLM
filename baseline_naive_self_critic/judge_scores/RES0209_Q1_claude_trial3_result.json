  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and frequency differences between daytime and nighttime symptoms. However, it omits the explicit mention of chest tightness (confirmed at D-20, P-20), which is a key symptom in the Gold Answer. The facts presented are correct but incomplete.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 75-80% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies three of the four main symptoms (dry cough, breathing difficulty, wheezing) and the daytime vs nighttime frequency difference. However, it omits: (1) chest tightness as a specific symptom, (2) the detail that the cough lasted approximately two weeks, (3) the doctor's confirmation about non-productive cough ('bringing up gunk'), (4) the specific detail that wheezing occurs more frequently than bronchodilator use, and (5) the characterization that the patient has 'hard time breathing' during episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer appropriately references specific exchanges [P-1], [P-11], [P-15], [P-18], [P-9]. There are no hallucinated facts or unverifiable claims. The answer stays grounded in the source material and does not add information not present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by organizing information into the requested categories: character of cough, breathing difficulties, wheezing, and daytime vs nighttime frequency. It stays focused on the question without irrelevant tangents. The structure mirrors the question's requirements, making it highly relevant."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate, well-structured response that directly addresses the question with correct facts grounded in the transcript. It successfully identifies three major symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) and correctly contrasts daytime versus nighttime symptom frequency. However, it misses the important symptom of chest tightness and some supporting details present in the Gold Answer, such as the two-week duration and the relationship between wheezing frequency and bronchodilator use. The answer demonstrates strong faithfulness to the source material with no hallucinations and excellent relevance to the question asked."
