  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer in listing all laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG), COVID swab, imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (oxygen saturation with supplemental O2 if needed), and therapeutic interventions (continuation of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, supplemental O2). It accurately cites [D-52] and references patient's inhalers from [P-11]. The only discrepancy is the omission of blood pressure monitoring from [D-37], which Gold includes as part of the comprehensive plan; however, core facts are fully consistent with no errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points from Gold: labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG, COVID swab), imaging (chest X-ray), monitoring (O2 saturation and supplemental O2), therapeutics (bronchodilators continuation, steroids, antibiotics, supplemental O2). Missed only the additional BP monitoring from [D-37], covering approximately 95% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript: labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics verbatim from [D-52]; bronchodilators reference patient's [P-11]; citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response into the exact categories requested (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics including specified interventions), with no off-topic content."
