  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All items listed in the Generated Answer match the doctor’s plan in [D-52]: CBC, electrolytes, kidney function tests, ABGs, chest X-ray, oxygen saturation monitoring with supplemental oxygen as needed, continuation of bronchodilators, and addition of steroids and antibiotics. The inclusion of a COVID swab is also correct per [D-52]. No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers nearly all key components from the Gold Answer’s management plan: labs (CBC/electrolytes/kidney function/ABGs), COVID swab, chest X-ray, O2 saturation monitoring, supplemental oxygen PRN, continuation of bronchodilators, and new steroids/antibiotics. Missing items mentioned in the Gold Answer include: (1) the expected COVID swab turnaround time (24–48 hours) and (2) the additional note about ongoing blood pressure monitoring from [D-37].",
    "faithfulness": "All listed interventions and tests are grounded in the transcript (primarily [D-52], with bronchodilators supported by [P-11]). No hallucinated medications, imaging, or monitoring procedures are introduced. The answer stays within what was said.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by enumerating laboratory tests, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions (steroids, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, bronchodilators) for the COPD exacerbation plan. No meaningful tangents."
