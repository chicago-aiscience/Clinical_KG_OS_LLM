  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors: it incorrectly claims chest pain was previously associated with teenage anxiety attacks citing [P-20] and [P-21], but [P-20] refers to heart fluttering during anxiety, not chest pain, and [P-17] explicitly states no prior chest pain; it omits key timeline details like smoking starting at age 18, escalation to 10/day for 2 years, reduction a few months ago, father's heart attack, and precise 'last couple of weeks' stress escalation; contradicts Gold by portraying chest pain as recurrence rather than new symptom.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: teenage anxiety ~8 years ago [P-21], current smoking reduction [P-14], recent academic stress [P-13/P-15/P-16], chest pain onset 1.5 weeks ago [P-2/P-3]; missed: smoking start at 18 [P-18], smoking escalation last 2 years [P-18], cut few months ago [P-18], 8-year anxiety gap [P-22], father's heart attack [P-8/P-30], thesis time crunch last couple weeks [P-16], symptom newness emphasized [P-17], noticeable when alone [P-9/P-29]; covers ~50-60% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: teen anxiety [P-21], smoking reduction [P-14], stress busy school [P-13], chest pain details [P-1/P-3/P-6]; unverifiable/hallucinated: 'knowledge graph' references not in transcript, chest pain previously associated with anxiety (misinterprets [P-20], contradicts [P-17]), recurrence of chest pain symptoms; multiple hallucinated facts and KG inventions.",
    "relevance": "Directly traces a timeline from teen anxiety/smoking to recent stress to chest pain onset, addresses phase relations via stress/anxiety; minor tangents with irrelevant 'knowledge graph' and biological trigger concepts."
