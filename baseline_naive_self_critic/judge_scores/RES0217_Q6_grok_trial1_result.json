{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with the Gold Answer across all elements: diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick to lab, blood work) match exactly with citations; treatment rationale (prophylactic antibiotics due to >72-hour attachment) aligns, though it omits explicit geographic risk mention but no contradictions; physician consultation matches intent and timing; preventive advice covers all points verbatim from transcript. No errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers 100% of diagnostic tests (3 points), treatment recommendation and primary rationale, physician consultation, and all 3 preventive advice points; minor omission of geographic risk (Strathroy [D-13]) as secondary rationale for antibiotics and exact quotes like 'moving forward with antibiotics' or 'safer than not', but core plan fully represented (80-99%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [D-18] for most plan elements, [D-6] for antibiotic rationale); minor unverifiable inference in describing 'the doctor' as 'likely a colleague or specialist' (transcript implies supervising physician [D-13,D-22]), but no hallucinations or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured and focused on the question's elements (diagnostics lab/physical, treatments, consultation, preventive advice for garden/outdoor), with no irrelevant content or tangents."
