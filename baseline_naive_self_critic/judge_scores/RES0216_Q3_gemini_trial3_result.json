  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the diagnosis and the primary evidence (asthma history, chest tightness, and ruling out cardiac causes). However, it includes a logically awkward statement suggesting 'asthma exacerbation is a differential for cardiac ischemia,' whereas clinically, both are differentials for chest tightness. The Gold Answer more accurately reflects that the absence of cardiac symptoms lowered the priority of a cardiac picture.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several nuanced points included in the Gold Answer: the specific details about skipping the evening maintenance dose, the exclusion of new environmental triggers, the patient's own acknowledgement of a potential link, and the use of a therapeutic trial with rescue puffers to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript, correctly citing sections for symptoms and history. However, it introduces an external concept ('knowledge graph relationship') that is not present in the transcript or Gold Answer, which acts as a minor hallucination of the source's structure.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both the 'what' (symptoms/history) and the 'how' (linking/exclusion) components of the question in a clear, structured format."
