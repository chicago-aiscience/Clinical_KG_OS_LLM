  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies all three OTC products the patient tried for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and correctly reports they were not very effective, consistent with [P-6]. However, it incorrectly states the patient did not report any routine OTC medications or supplements; the transcript clearly states the patient takes a multivitamin ([P-25]). This is a direct contradiction of the source and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Included: Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer; lack of effectiveness (“hasn't really helped very much”).\nMissed: daily multivitamin as the patient’s only routine supplement/ongoing non-prescription product ([P-25]).\nThe Gold Answer also mentions no prescription meds and some non-med stress-management habits; these are less central to the question than the multivitamin, but the multivitamin omission is a major gap.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements (the three OTC trials and their limited benefit) are directly supported by [P-6]. The claim that the patient did not report any routine OTC medications/supplements is not supported and is contradicted by [P-25] (multivitamin). The smoking details cited are supported by [P-13], [P-14], though they are not medications/supplements.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely focused on OTC pain-relief attempts and effectiveness (highly relevant). It introduces smoking status/lifestyle details, which are not asked for in the question about OTC meds/supplements, creating a minor tangent."
