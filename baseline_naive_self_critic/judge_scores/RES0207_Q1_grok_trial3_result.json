  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the sudden shortness of breath [P-1] and dry cough [P-4] as respiratory symptoms, and the seizure last night [P-8] and epilepsy [P-8] as neurological symptoms, matching the Gold Answer's core facts. However, it incorrectly states that the patient 'did not provide an objective measurement regarding fever,' directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript where the patient reports 37.4°C [P-5, P-6], a significant factual error on a key question component.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: sudden shortness of breath [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure last night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8]. Missed from Gold: shortness of breath upon waking and ~3 hours prior [P-1, P-11], cough onset that morning [P-2], no sputum [P-4 explicitly], felt fine after seizure [P-8], fever 37.4°C mild that morning [P-5, P-6]; pertinent negatives not covered. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on respiratory and neurological symptoms are verifiable in transcript with accurate citations [P-1, P-4, P-8]. The claim 'did not provide an objective measurement regarding fever' is a hallucination/misreading, as P-5 explicitly states '37.4 I think' after confirming fever, introducing unverifiable false information.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question's components (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, fever measurement) with bullet points, no off-topic content."
