  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient’s pre-visit respiratory inhalers as Ventolin and Spiriva and the non-respiratory medication as “Torva Staten” (atorvastatin) for hypercholesterolemia. However, it fails to correctly report the quantified Ventolin use in the prior week (≈10 times [P-12]) and does not specify that the discontinued antihypertensive was a diuretic [P-35]. It also does not clearly attribute the “without doctor approval” point to the explicit statement in [P-36], instead inferring it from [P-34].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements: (1) Ventolin and Spiriva pre-visit (covered); (2) Ventolin use ~10 times in past week (missed—only qualitative); (3) atorvastatin/Torva Staten (covered); (4) prior BP med was a diuretic (missed); (5) patient stopped it without physician approval (only partially stated, not clearly tied to [P-36]). Overall, it covers roughly half to slightly more than half of the required details, missing two major specifics (Ventolin frequency and diuretic).",
    "faithfulness": "All included medications (Ventolin, Spiriva, Torva Staten/atorvastatin, prior BP meds) are supported by the transcript. The statement that the patient discontinued BP medication without approval is supported by [P-36] (though the Generated Answer cites [P-34] and does not explicitly reference [P-36]). No clear hallucinated medications or events are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked items (medications prior to visit, Ventolin use frequency, and which medication they stopped without approval). The main issue is missing specificity rather than off-topic content."

  "summary": "Relevant and largely transcript-grounded, but it misses key required specifics—especially Ventolin use (~10 times in the past week) and that the self-discontinued blood pressure medication was a diuretic—reducing correctness and completeness."
