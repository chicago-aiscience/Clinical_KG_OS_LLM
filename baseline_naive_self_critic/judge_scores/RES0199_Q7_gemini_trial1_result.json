  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate according to the transcript. It correctly identifies the onset of headache and cough four days ago, GI symptoms a few days back, and loss of smell one day ago. However, it uses the term 'persistent' to describe the course of the headache and cough; while 'persistent' is used in the transcript to describe the headache's constancy (constant vs. intermittent), the question specifically asks about 'severity over time,' which the patient described as staying 'around the same.'",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main points but lacks the precision found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it misses that diarrhea began '2 days ago' (the Gold Answer uses this to establish the relative timeline more clearly than 'a few days after') and that vomiting specifically occurred 'yesterday.' It also fails to explicitly state that the severity of the cough and headache 'remained stable' or 'stayed the same,' opting instead for 'persistent.'",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All points are supported by the text, and citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-24]) are accurate and relevant. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the multi-part question, providing a clear timeline and descriptions for each symptom mentioned."
