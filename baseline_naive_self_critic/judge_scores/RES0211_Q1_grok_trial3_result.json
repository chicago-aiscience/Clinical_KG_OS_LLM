  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies some reported symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, feeling crappy, headache) matching Gold and transcript [P-1, P-2, P-4], but omits key ones like persistent feeling hot/feverish [P-7, P-9], malaise [P-14, D-15], and tiredness [P-13]; for denials, it vaguely references joint pain [P-13] but incorrectly states no explicit denials for sputum/phlegm [P-5, P-6], rashes [P-10], nausea/vomiting [P-11], diarrhea [P-12], contradicting Gold and transcript, leading to significant factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key reported points: 3-4 day dry cough/scratchy throat, headache, feeling hot day/night, crappy/icky/malaise, tired (covers ~4/6 partially); denied: sputum/phlegm, rashes/skin changes, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, joint aches, breathing difficulty (covers ~1/6 partially); overall ~25% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms verifiable [P-1 etc.]; denial of hurting [P-13] accurate but misinterpreted; claims of 'no explicit mentions' for sputum (explicitly denied [P-5,P-6]), nausea [P-11], etc., are unverifiable/false as denials are directly in transcript; implicit sputum denial via dry cough plausible [P-1,P-4]; multiple erroneous claims about absence of content.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around reported symptoms and denied symptoms, addressing the question's focus on 3-4 day symptoms and explicit denials (including examples); minor irrelevant note on 'knowledge graph' (not provided) and interpretive pain denial."
