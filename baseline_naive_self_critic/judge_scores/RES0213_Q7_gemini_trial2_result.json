  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it states that the chest pain is a 'recurrence' and was 'previously associated with teenage anxiety attacks.' However, the patient explicitly states in [P-17] that she has never felt this pain before. The Generated Answer misinterprets [P-20], where the patient is referring to heart fluttering/palpitations during anxiety attacks, not the sharp chest pain mentioned in the current complaint.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several critical timeline elements from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention that smoking started at age 18. 2) It misses the period of smoking 10 cigarettes/day for two years. 3) It completely omits the father's heart attack, which is a key psychological driver for the patient's current concern. 4) It misses the specific 'time crunch' of the thesis mentioned for the 'last couple of weeks'.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates that the chest pain is a recurring symptom, which contradicts [P-17]. Additionally, it introduces external schema-like tags (e.g., '[PAST_CONDITION]... --[HISTORY_OF]-->') and 'knowledge graph' terminology that is not found in the source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer follows the requested structure of tracing a timeline and explaining correlations. However, by missing the start of the smoking history and the father's medical history, it fails to fully answer the specific 'starting from' and 'how each phase related' requirements of the prompt."
