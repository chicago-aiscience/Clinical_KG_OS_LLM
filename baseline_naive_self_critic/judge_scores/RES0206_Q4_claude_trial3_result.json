  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the covid swab as the test ordered, and accurately describes the social contact detail (walking with a sick friend in close proximity). All factual claims align with the Gold Answer and transcript citations are accurate.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three main components requested: the condition (COVID), the test (covid swab), and the social contact detail (walking with sick friend outdoors, sometimes too close). However, it omits some enriching details present in the Gold Answer, such as the doctor's systematic screening for COVID-associated symptoms (smell, taste, confusion, muscle aches) and the patient's uncertainty about whether the friend was tested. These additional details provide fuller context but are not strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [D-43], [P-20]. There is no hallucinated content. The answer stays grounded in the source material without introducing unsupported facts.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question without tangential information. The formatting with clear headers makes it easy to identify each component. The summary reinforces the key points concisely. All content is directly relevant to answering what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately and faithfully addresses all three components of the question (condition to rule out, test ordered, and social contact detail) with proper transcript citations. It is factually correct and highly relevant. The only minor limitation is that it omits some enriching contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the systematic screening for COVID-associated symptoms and the patient's uncertainty about the friend's testing status, which slightly reduces completeness."
