  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states Lipitor for high cholesterol (from transcript [P-25,26]), confirmed only one [P-27]. Tylenol for symptom relief (feverish/unwell) [P-14], 'helps a little bit'. Generated correctly identifies Lipitor for cholesterol and Tylenol with effectiveness quote, but incorrectly attributes Tylenol to relieving cough (not stated in transcript or Gold; Gold specifies feverish/unwell). Lipitor not specified as atorvastatin in Generated (minor). Core meds correct, but factual error on Tylenol purpose vs Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Lipitor (atorvastatin) for high cholesterol, only prescribed med; Tylenol OTC for fever/unwell, partial effectiveness; no others. Generated covers Lipitor (cholesterol), Tylenol (effectiveness), but wrong condition for Tylenol, misses 'only med', no mention of no others or extras like allergies. Covers main meds and effectiveness (~80%), misses nuances.",
    "faithfulness": "Lipitor source [P-26] and cholesterol from [P-25] verifiable. Tylenol [P-14] and quote verifiable. However, 'knowledge graph' not in transcript (hallucinated external source); Tylenol relieves cough not in transcript (patient context is general symptoms post-cough/fever discussion, not specified for cough). Multiple hallucinated elements (knowledge graph references).",
    "relevance": "Generated directly lists medications, sources, conditions, and OTC effectiveness in structured format matching question perfectly, no off-topic content."
