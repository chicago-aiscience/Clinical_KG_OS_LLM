  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold lists specific reported symptoms (dry cough with timeline/worsening, fever details, fatigue, dec appetite, poss taste loss, mild runny nose, uncertain SOB) and detailed denied symptoms (sputum/blood, wheezing, chest pain/heart racing, sore throat, chills/night sweats, skin changes, GI issues, nausea/vom, urine changes, dizziness/fainting, confusion, vision/hearing fine, swallowing uncertain). Generated correctly identifies dry cough worsening, runny nose, fever >100, fatigue, poss taste loss, and links appetite to P-17 (though appetite also in P-15). However, misses cough timeline (3 days), fever specifics (100.1/101), SOB uncertainty, separate appetite note; crucially, incorrectly states no specific symptoms like wheezing/sore throat/chest pain/chills/GI were asked/denied (they were explicitly asked and denied in D-6/7/13/14/19/22/23 etc.), and adds irrelevant neuro symptoms from D-44 advice as 'asked and denied' which were not. Significant contradictions on denied symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: dry cough worsening (partial, misses 3-day timeline), fever (partial, misses exact values), fatigue, poss taste loss, runny nose, appetite (partial). Missed: cough start Wed eve/progression details, fever first Friday, SOB uncertain w/ decreased activity, all denied symptoms (wheezing, chest pain, sore throat, chills, GI, etc. - 12+ points), swallowing uncertain, vision/hearing. Covers ~25-30% of key points (6 partial reported out of ~20 total).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on reported symptoms verifiable (citations P-1,16,17,8 accurate). Runny nose 'look at' likely typo for 'little'. However, 'none of specific symptoms explicitly asked' false - transcript shows explicit asks/denials (D-7 wheezing P-7 no; D-13 chest pain P-13 no; D-14 sore throat P-14 no; D-19 chills P-19 no; D-22/23 GI P-22/23 no). Hallucinates neuro symptoms (seizures etc.) as 'explicitly asked and denied' - D-44 is advice for worsening, not Hx inquiry; P-8/P-15 not explicit denials. Mentions unmentioned 'knowledge graph'. Multiple misreadings/hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer into mother-reported resp/systemic symptoms and doctor-asked/denied, matching question parts. Minor tangent on neuro symptoms from later advice, but focused on symptoms; no major off-topic content."
