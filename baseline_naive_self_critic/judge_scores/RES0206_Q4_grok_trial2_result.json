{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer specifies 'COVID-19' while Generated uses 'COVID' (minor naming discrepancy, equivalent); condition, test (covid swab), and core social contact detail (walking dogs with sick friend, too close) match exactly with accurate citations [D-43, P-20]; extra phrase 'cited in the knowledge graph' not in Gold or transcript but does not contradict core facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: condition (COVID-19), test (swab [D-43]), main social detail (friends walking dogs outside, one sick, walked too close [P-20]); missed: patient's uncertainty about friend's COVID test [P-21], doctor's screening for COVID symptoms (smell/taste/confusion/muscle aches denied [P-32/33/34/35]), travel denial [P-31], and explanatory context on why testing warranted despite denials; covers ~60-70% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims (condition, test quote [D-43], social contact quote [P-20]) directly verifiable in transcript; minor hallucination in 'established the risk factor of exposure cited in the knowledge graph' (no knowledge graph in transcript); no other fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question (condition, test, prompting social detail) with structured format and summary; no off-topic content."
