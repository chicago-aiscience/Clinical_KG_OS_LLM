  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has several factual inaccuracies compared to the Gold Answer: it misstates the timeline (claims symptoms after returning home on Thursday, but transcript [P-1] indicates symptoms started Wednesday evening after school); it inaccurately claims no specific known sick contacts at school without noting mother's 'kinda hard to say' [P-38]; it vaguely addresses outside contacts but misses the explicit 'we know for sure, not outside of school' [P-38]; most critically, it falsely states the transcript lacks information on school notifications, contradicting [P-39] where mother says 'They haven't like contacted us about anything'; it also omits mother's direct concern about COVID from school [P-2]. These are significant errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: school central/mother COVID concern [P-2], symptoms post-Wed school [P-1], no known sick outside ('know for sure') [P-38], school 'hard to say' [P-38], school not notified [P-39], school test req [P-41], no travel [P-40], no env exposures [P-37]. Generated covers partially school as source (wrong timeline), vague no known sick school/outside; misses mother's concern, exact quotes on contacts, school notification (denies existence), test req, no travel/env. Covers ~20-30% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated misreads timeline ([P-1] Wednesday symptoms, not Thursday); infers 'no specific known sick at school' but mother says 'hard to say' [P-38]; irrelevant P-8 for outside contacts; hallucinates absence of school notification info despite explicit [P-39] 'haven't contacted us'; no citations for non-existent claims. Multiple unverifiable/misstated claims.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses school as potential source, sick contacts at/ outside school, and school notifications (though inaccurately); minor irrelevant detail from P-8 but overall focused on question."
