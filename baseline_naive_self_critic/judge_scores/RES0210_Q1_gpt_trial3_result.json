  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key reported symptoms: cough [P-1], productive sputum described as “yellow custard” with “spots of red” [P-6], right-sided chest pain [P-17], and chills [P-9]. However, it characterizes the cough duration only as “a couple of days” [P-1] and does not reflect the fuller timeline (raspy cough Friday, worse by Sunday) described later [P-3]. It also omits the patient’s reported subjective fever/hot feeling starting Monday [P-8] and important chest-pain qualifiers (constant/dull; worse with cough/deep breath) [P-18–P-21]. These are omissions rather than direct contradictions, but they reduce overall accuracy relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: cough present; sputum color/appearance (yellow, blood-tinged spots); right-sided chest pain location; chills.\nKey elements missed: progression/timeline (raspy Friday → severe Sunday) [P-3]; sputum onset details (started Sunday; appeared simultaneously) [P-4, P-7]; fever/feeling hot and persistence through visit day [P-8]; chest pain quality and course (constant, dull, present at rest/lying down; pleuritic and cough-related worsening) [P-18–P-21]; dyspnea on exertion [P-10–P-11]; sore/raw throat after coughing [P-15]; resolved runny nose a week prior [P-16]; no weight loss [P-22]. Overall captures less than half of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included statements are supported by the transcript (cough [P-1], sputum description [P-6], right-sided chest pain [P-17], chills [P-9]). No clear hallucinated symptoms or unsupported details are added. The only concern is that relying on “couple of days” [P-1] does not incorporate later clarification, but it remains transcript-grounded.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question targets (sputum description, chest pain, systemic symptoms). It does not add irrelevant material, but it under-answers systemic symptoms by omitting fever and under-describes chest pain."
