  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies only one respiratory symptom (cough) when the Gold Answer specifies two (cough and runny nose). It wrongly states that the cough nature (productive vs. non-productive) is not specified, despite clear evidence in the transcript of a dry, non-productive cough (D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6). It also denies nasal discharge despite explicit reporting (D-11, P-11, D-12, P-12). These are significant factual errors and contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) cough for 4-5 days, (2) dry/non-productive cough confirmed no gunk, (3) severity stayed the same, (4) runny nose for couple of days, (5) clear nasal discharge, (6) first-time dry cough and longer duration than past runny noses, (7) pertinent negatives (no sore throat, chest pain, SOB/wheeze). Generated covers only cough duration partially (~1 key point), missing 85-90% including the second symptom and all characteristics.",
    "faithfulness": "Cough duration verifiable [P-2, P-4]; however, claim that cough nature not specified is false/hallucinated absence (contradicted by D-5/P-5 'dry cough', D-6/P-6 'no gunk'); nasal discharge denial is hallucinated absence (D-11/P-11 'runny nose', D-12/P-12 'pretty clear'); COVID swab mention is verifiable but irrelevant to symptoms and used to deny discharge. Multiple contradictions and fabricated absences.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly focuses on respiratory symptoms, cough characteristics, and nasal discharge as asked, with no off-topic content or tangents, though incomplete and inaccurate."
