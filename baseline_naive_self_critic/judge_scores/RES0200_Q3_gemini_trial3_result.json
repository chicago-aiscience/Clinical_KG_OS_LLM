  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's description of the symptoms (cough, dyspnea, sputum changes) and the doctor's reasoning. It correctly identifies the timeline for the cough (last week) and dyspnea (last few days), as well as the specific color change in sputum (clear/white to yellow).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points required by the prompt. It details the three specific symptoms, acknowledges the established COPD history, and provides the specific quote from the doctor in [D-52] that links the worsening symptoms to the history to form the diagnosis. While it omits the specific duration of the COPD history (5 years) and the specific inhalers mentioned in the Gold Answer, these were supporting details rather than the core symptoms requested.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript. The citations [P-1], [P-8], [P-6], and [D-52] are accurately used to ground the information in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question: identifying the specific symptoms and explaining how the doctor linked them in the final assessment."
