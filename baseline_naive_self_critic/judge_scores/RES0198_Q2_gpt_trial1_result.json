  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the patient tried over-the-counter “decongestants” and that the patient felt it “worked a little bit,” consistent with [P-10]. It also correctly states the doctor recommended an OTC medication “like Tylenol Cold,” consistent with [D-39]. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core elements asked in the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) decongestants tried, (2) “worked a little bit” effectiveness assessment, and (3) recommendation of Tylenol Cold. However, compared to the full Gold Answer, it omits additional forward-going supportive-care guidance mentioned by the doctor (e.g., staying well hydrated) and the expectation that symptoms may take a few weeks to resolve. Thus it is not 100% coverage of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript: decongestants and perceived partial benefit in [P-10], and Tylenol Cold recommendation in [D-39]. No hallucinated medications or effects are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays tightly focused on the question: prior medication, perceived effectiveness, and recommended OTC treatment. No irrelevant content."
