  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect relative to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It claims the doctor did not screen for or document absence of fever, dyspnea, sore throat, etc., but the transcript explicitly contains systematic ROS negatives: no fever (D-10/P-10), no difficulty breathing (D-11/P-11), no headaches (D-12/P-12), no sore throat (D-13/P-13), no chills/night sweats (D-14/P-14), no myalgias/weakness (D-15/P-15), no chest pain (D-22/P-22), and cough being dry with no sputum/blood (D-7/P-7). Therefore the core assertion (“no negative findings documented”) directly contradicts documented content.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer lists multiple pertinent negatives (fever, dyspnea, headache, sore throat, chills/night sweats, myalgias/weakness, chest pain, no sputum/hemoptysis, no triggers) and additional denials (no chronic conditions, meds, surgeries/hospitalizations, allergies, family history). The Generated Answer includes none of these negatives; instead it incorrectly states they were not evaluated. Thus it misses essentially all key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not grounded in the transcript because it asserts the absence of ROS screening/documented negatives when the transcript clearly shows the clinician asked and the patient denied multiple symptoms (D-10 through D-15, D-22, D-7, D-21). This is a direct contradiction of the source, constituting major unfaithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly focused on the question (ROS negatives and their role) but answers by denying that any negatives were assessed and shifts to listing positive findings. While still on the general topic of symptom assessment in the encounter, it fails to provide the requested list of negative findings and offers an irrelevant-to-the-task emphasis on positives."
