  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the transcript and Gold Answer regarding the symptoms it does list. It correctly identifies the cough, sputum, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, sinus pressure, and fever. It also correctly identifies the cough as the most bothersome symptom.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points present in the Gold Answer: 1) Reduced exercise tolerance (the difficulty walking her dog/around the block). 2) The systemic symptom of a headache. 3) The extensive list of pertinent negatives (denial of sore throat, GI issues, etc.) that characterize a thorough clinical report. It also lacks the nuance that the fever was unconfirmed via thermometer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the provided transcript. The citations to specific turns ([P-1], [P-12], etc.) are accurate.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and stays focused on the question asked without providing unnecessary external information, although it is less comprehensive than the gold standard."
