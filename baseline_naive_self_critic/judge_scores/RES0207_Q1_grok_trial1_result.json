  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the respiratory symptoms (sudden shortness of breath [P-1] and dry cough [P-4]) and neurological symptoms (seizure last night [P-8] and epilepsy [P-8]), matching the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly states that the patient 'did NOT provide an objective measurement regarding fever,' directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript [P-5, P-6] where the patient reports 37.4°C that morning. This is a significant factual error on a core element of the question.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: respiratory (sudden SOB upon waking [P-1], ~3 hours prior [P-11], sudden cough that morning [P-2], dry no sputum [P-4]); neurological (seizure previous night [P-8], epilepsy [P-8], felt fine after [P-8]); fever (37.4°C morning, mild [P-5], confirmed morning [P-6]); pertinent negatives. Generated covers SOB sudden, dry cough, seizure, epilepsy (~40-50% coverage), misses timings/onset details, 'fine after,' fever details entirely (wrongly denies), and negatives. Covers 50-79% partially but with error.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on SOB [P-1], dry cough [P-4], seizure/epilepsy [P-8] are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. The claim 'did NOT provide an objective measurement' is not grounded, as [P-5] explicitly states '37.4 I think' after checking temperature; this is a hallucinated denial contradicting the transcript. No other fabrications, but this erroneous claim affects grounding.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is perfectly structured around the question's elements (respiratory symptoms, neurological symptoms, fever measurement), with bullet points directly addressing each part and no off-topic content."
