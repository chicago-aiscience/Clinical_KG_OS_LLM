  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the cough as mostly dry (matches [P-12]) and notes nausea/vomiting/diarrhea were present (consistent with [P-1]). However, it contains major factual errors by claiming the transcript does not specify: (1) diarrhea frequency—when it clearly states “five or six times a day” with liquid stools ([P-28]); (2) number of vomiting episodes—when it explicitly states “I vomited two times” ([P-32]); and (3) headache numerical severity—when it is rated “like 7” out of 10 ([P-8]). These errors contradict the transcript and the Gold Answer’s required specifics.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: presence of GI symptoms (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea) and dry cough. Key elements missed: diarrhea onset (~2 days) and frequency (5–6/day) and liquid character; vomiting timing (yesterday), number (2), content (food contents), and no blood; respiratory qualifiers (no sputum/blood, stable severity, and negatives like no SOB/wheezing/chest pain); headache details requested (severity 7/10) plus other described characteristics. Overall, well under 50% of required key details are included.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not faithful to the transcript: the answer repeatedly states that frequency of diarrhea, number of vomiting episodes, and numeric headache severity are not specified, despite being explicitly stated in [P-28], [P-32], and [P-8]. While most other included claims are grounded, these multiple contradictions represent significant unfaithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic (GI and respiratory symptoms and requested characteristics) and attempts to address each requested attribute. However, it fails to provide the key specifics asked (frequency, counts, severity rating), which reduces usefulness but does not introduce major irrelevant tangents."
