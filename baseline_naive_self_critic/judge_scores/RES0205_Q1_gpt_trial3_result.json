  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main persistent symptom (cough for two weeks) and that it is currently dry, and it correctly lists early/now-resolved symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, mucus/“flu symptoms”). However, it slightly overstates “chest pain” as a symptom: in the transcript the patient denies chest pain per se, describing instead mild chest soreness only after excessive coughing. This is a minor discrepancy because the answer hedges with “(or soreness).”",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: persistent 2-week cough; current dry cough; early mucus that resolved; sore throat resolved; runny nose resolved; general statement that other early “flu symptoms” resolved; cough-related chest soreness.\nKey points missed: the detailed timeline (mucus for first 4–5 days; sore throat 2–3 days; most other symptoms resolved by 3–4 days); cough characteristics including approximate frequency (3–4 times/hour), spontaneous/no triggers, and stable intensity/frequency; explicit pertinent negatives (no shortness of breath, no fever, no nausea/vomiting, no abdominal pain). Overall, this is roughly partial coverage (~50–70%).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript. The only notable faithfulness issue is phrasing chest discomfort as “chest pain” rather than clearly as post-tussive soreness, though it is qualified. The mention of a “knowledge graph provided” is not supported by the transcript but does not affect the clinical content.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the question: symptoms during the two-week illness, separated into resolved vs still present. No major tangents."
