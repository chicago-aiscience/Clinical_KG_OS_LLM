  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, matching the Gold Answer's quote from [D-52]. It correctly specifies the swab test and 24-48 hour turnaround time, directly from [D-52]. The alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative is also precisely quoted and matches the Gold. No factual errors or contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) rule out COVID-19 [D-52] - covered; (2) swab test [D-52] - covered; (3) 24-48 hours TAT [D-52] - covered; (4) alternative diagnosis if negative: another viral illness [D-52] - covered. While Gold includes additional details like isolation, positive result actions, and supportive management, these are not core to the question's key elements, and Generated covers 100% of the directly queried points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations and quotes (minor transcription variances like 'as covid' vs 'is covid' are negligible). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured perfectly to address each part of the question (condition, test, TAT, alternative diagnosis) with no off-topic content or tangents; highly focused."
