  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is entirely incorrect. It claims the doctor did not explore living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts, but the transcript explicitly shows the doctor asking about these in segments [D-45] through [D-50].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer regarding the patient's apartment, car dealership workplace, lack of travel history, and potential contact in the work lunch room.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript. It claims no dialogue segments referenced travel or workplace, despite direct questions in [D-48] and [D-49].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer provides a false negative response to the question, failing to provide the specific details requested about the doctor's systematic exploration."
