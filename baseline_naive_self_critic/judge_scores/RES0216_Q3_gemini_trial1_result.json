  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the core clinical reasoning used by the doctor (asthma history, medication non-adherence, and exertion-triggered symptoms). However, it includes an artifact of AI reasoning ('knowledge graph relationship') which is not present in the transcript or Gold Answer. It also slightly misstates the relationship by saying 'asthma exacerbation is a differential for cardiac ischemia,' whereas they are both differentials for the symptom of chest tightness.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers several key points: history of asthma, reduced medication use, and the exclusion of cardiac causes. However, it misses a few points mentioned in the Gold Answer: the lack of environmental triggers, the patient's own acknowledgment that it might be related to asthma, and the specific mention of the therapeutic trial (rescue puffers) as the method the doctor used to link/verify the findings.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript. The mention of a 'knowledge graph relationship' is a hallucination/meta-commentary not found in the source text or the doctor's spoken reasoning.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the combination of factors and the linking process used by the doctor."
