  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the frequency of inhaler usage is not mentioned in the transcript, whereas the Gold Answer and transcript [P-26] specify daily and bi-weekly usage. It also incorrectly states that no reason is given for the lack of antihypertensive medication, missing the patient's explicit explanation in [P-23] regarding lifestyle modifications.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific 'every day' and 'once every two weeks' frequencies, and the specific lifestyle strategies (weight loss and walking) used for hypertension management. It only identifies the basic medications (puffers) and smoking cessation.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a 'hallucinated negative' by claiming information is missing from the source text when it is clearly provided in segments P-23, P-24, and P-26. It fails to ground the 'why' and 'how frequently' portions of the question in the available dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The response is structured to address all parts of the question using appropriate headings, but because it fails to extract the actual data from the transcript, it provides little relevant information for the specific 'how frequently' and 'why' components."
