{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the nature of the cough (productive vs. non-productive), whereas the transcript explicitly identifies it as a 'dry cough' and the patient denies bringing up 'gunk.' Furthermore, it claims the appearance of nasal discharge is not reported, but the patient explicitly mentions a runny nose that is 'pretty clear.'",
    "completeness": "The answer is highly incomplete. It misses the second primary respiratory symptom (runny nose) and fails to provide the specific characteristics for the cough (dry/non-productive) and the discharge (clear) requested by the prompt. It also omits the pertinent negatives mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is not faithful to the transcript. It claims information is missing or not reported when that information is explicitly provided in segments D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6, P-11, and P-12. While it correctly identifies the duration of the cough from P-2, the rest of the response is a failure of extraction.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it correctly identifies 'cough' as a symptom, it fails to address the specific sub-questions regarding the characteristics of the symptoms, despite those details being present in the source text."
