  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately reports the negative test result. It correctly cites the patient's occupation as hospital clerk and the persistent cough. However, it lacks the specific timeline detail that the test was done 'approximately two weeks ago at symptom onset' and omits that the patient has been home since testing awaiting symptom resolution before returning to work.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main points: COVID-19 as the diagnosis, the occupational exposure as hospital worker, the persistent cough with initial flu-like symptoms, and the negative test result. However, it misses several key details from the Gold Answer: the specific citation that test was done when symptoms first started (two weeks ago), the patient's use of PPE and being 'very careful', the social pressure aspect of coworkers being 'scared', and the important detail that patient has been home since testing awaiting resolution before return to work. Covers approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The COVID-19 testing is mentioned in P-35, the persistent cough in P-2, the flu-like symptoms in P-14, hospital clerk occupation in P-34, and colleagues' reactions in P-35. The citations provided are accurate. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated (COVID-19), what evidence prompted investigation (persistent cough, flu-like symptoms, hospital worker status, colleague concerns), and what testing revealed (negative result). The response is focused and relevant throughout."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis and correctly reports the negative test result with proper transcript citations. It addresses all three components of the question with relevant information. However, it lacks important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including the specific testing timeline, post-test isolation period, PPE usage, and the fuller context of workplace social dynamics. The answer is factually correct and well-grounded in the transcript but could be more complete in covering the nuanced details of the clinical scenario."
