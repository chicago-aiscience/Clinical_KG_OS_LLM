{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as asthma (specifically exercise-induced or allergic). This aligns perfectly with the Gold Answer's diagnosis of pediatric asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and atopy.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer missed several key points present in the Gold Answer and specifically requested in the prompt. It failed to mention that symptoms resolve spontaneously with rest [P-6, P-33] and that they occur across multiple settings [P-38]. It also omitted the nocturnal wheezing [P-43] and the pertinent negatives (lack of fever, phlegm, etc.) that the Gold Answer used to rule out infectious causes.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are directly supported by the provided transcript and use accurate citations (e.g., P-3, P-38, P-35, P-36). No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's request for a diagnosis and supporting transcript evidence, though it could have been more thorough in addressing every condition mentioned in the prompt's lead-in."
