  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the core present symptoms (chest tightness, difficulty breathing/getting a full breath, hoarseness, phlegm/throat clearing) with accurate citations matching the Gold Answer and transcript. However, it omits key details from Gold such as the 3-day duration, diffuse 'all over' nature, specific worsening triggers (e.g., getting up from chair, deep breaths), and frames difficulty breathing with a doctor paraphrase [D-36] that slightly misaligns with patient's report of exertion-related symptoms. Critically, it only lists chest pain and cough as denied (correct), but misses anxiety/sweating/impending doom [P-6], fevers [P-12], night sweats [P-13], chills [P-14], and weight loss [P-15], and falsely asserts the transcript lacks explicit denials for these, directly contradicting Gold and transcript. This constitutes significant factual errors and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: chest tightness details (partially: sensation on breathing/walking, but misses 3 days, diffuse, full list of triggers), difficulty full breath (yes), upper airway hoarse/phlegm/throat clearing (yes), denied chest pain (yes), cough (yes). Missed: precise timing/onset, full trigger list, all other denials (anxiety/sweat/doom, fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss), systematic elicitation, cardiac differential note. Covers core present symptoms (~80%) but only ~30% of denials and details, totaling ~50-60% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Symptom claims and citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-5], [P-7], [P-11]) are directly verifiable in transcript. Doctor summaries [D-34, D-36] are accurately quoted but D-36 on 'out of breath' is a paraphrase that downplays patient's exertion symptoms. Major issue: note claiming 'transcript does not contain explicit denials' for fevers etc. is entirely false/hallucinated, as P-6/12-15 explicitly deny them. Introduces multiple inaccurate claims about transcript content.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to answer the question with sections on reported symptoms (categorized by chest/respiratory/upper airway) and explicit denials, directly matching query focus; minor note on incompleteness does not detract, no off-topic content."
