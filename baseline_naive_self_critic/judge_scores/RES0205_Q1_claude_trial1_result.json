  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate regarding the key symptoms. It correctly identifies the dry cough as currently present, chest pain/soreness when coughing, and the resolved symptoms of sore throat, runny nose, and mucus production. However, it lacks the specific timeline details present in the Gold Answer (e.g., 'first two to three days' for sore throat, 'first four to five days' for mucus, 'whitish clear' mucus description). The answer is correct but less precise than the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main categories of symptoms but misses several specific details from the Gold Answer: (1) the exact timeline for mucus production (4-5 days), (2) the description of mucus as 'whitish clear', (3) cough frequency (3-4 times per hour), (4) stability of intensity and frequency over time, (5) spontaneous nature with no triggers, (6) pertinent negatives (difficulty breathing, fevers, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain), and (7) the characterization of early symptoms as 'flu symptoms' resolving in 3-4 days. Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The dry cough is mentioned in P-5, chest pain when coughing in P-15/P-16, sore throat initially in P-13, runny nose initially in P-14, and mucus early on in P-5/P-6. The answer does not hallucinate any information and properly cites the relevant exchanges.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about symptoms during the two-week illness, distinguishing between resolved and current symptoms as requested. It stays focused on the question without introducing irrelevant information. The structure (current vs. resolved) matches what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate response that is well-grounded in the transcript and directly addresses the question. It correctly identifies the main current symptoms (dry cough, chest soreness) and resolved symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, mucus production). However, it lacks the detailed timeline information and specific descriptors present in the Gold Answer, such as exact durations, mucus characteristics, cough frequency, and pertinent negatives. The answer is reliable but less comprehensive than the reference standard."
