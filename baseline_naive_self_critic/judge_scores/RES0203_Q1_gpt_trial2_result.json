  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly identifies reduced smell and a mild dry cough. However, it incorrectly states the patient had a **complete** loss of taste; the transcript indicates **partial** taste loss (able to taste very salty foods but not normal flavors like banana) [P-4]. This is a clinically important discrepancy in degree of symptom loss.",
    "completeness": "It lists the three main symptoms (smell change, taste change, cough) but omits most of the key qualifying details from the Gold Answer: (1) partial nature of smell loss with ability to detect very strong unpleasant odors, (2) partial nature of taste loss with ability to taste very salty foods and inability to taste banana, (3) that symptoms were consistent over two days, (4) cough started at same time as sensory symptoms, (5) cough was non-productive with no sputum/blood, (6) no identified triggers. Overall, it covers only a minority of required details about degree and what the patient could/could not perceive.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript, but the claim of **complete** taste loss is not supported and conflicts with [P-4]. No other major hallucinations are present, but this contradiction reduces faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the patient’s sensory (smell/taste) and respiratory (cough) symptoms and attempts to describe degree, so it addresses the question without tangential material."
