  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer. Both correctly identify: (1) COVID-19 swab as the diagnostic test, (2) 14 days as the self-isolation duration, (3) positive test result as the condition for public health contact tracing, and (4) all supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for body aches). The Generated Answer also appropriately mentions the alternative diagnosis possibility and supportive nature of management regardless of diagnosis, consistent with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: diagnostic testing (COVID-19 swab with 24-48 hour timeline), 14-day self-isolation, contact tracing conditions (positive result triggers public health involvement), alternative diagnosis consideration (other viral illness), and all supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics/NSAIDs). The only minor difference is the Generated Answer doesn't explicitly mention the 24-48 hour timeframe for results, though it does reference the swab being ordered. The final statement about no prescription medications is implicit in Generated Answer's supportive care focus.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The answer includes appropriate citations to the source. The Knowledge Graph references mentioned appear to be additional verification tools but all core content is grounded in the transcript. No hallucinated information is present - every element (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care measures) is explicitly stated in [D-52].",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses all four components requested in the question: (1) diagnostic test ordered, (2) specific duration of self-isolation, (3) conditions for contact tracing initiation, and (4) all supportive care recommendations. The answer is well-organized using bullet points that map to each question component. No irrelevant information is included; even the mention of alternative diagnosis and Knowledge Graph references serve to contextualize the management plan appropriately."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent response that fully aligns with the Gold Answer. It accurately identifies all components of the management plan: COVID-19 swab testing, 14-day self-isolation, contact tracing conditional on positive results, and comprehensive supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics/NSAIDs). All information is properly grounded in the transcript citation [D-52] with no hallucinations. The answer directly addresses every aspect of the multi-part question with appropriate organization and completeness. The only negligible omission is the explicit mention of the 24-48 hour result timeframe, which does not materially affect the answer's quality."
