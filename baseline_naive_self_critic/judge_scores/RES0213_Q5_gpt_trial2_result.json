  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer: it correctly links the patient’s worry about a “heart thing” to her father’s heart attack “last year” and her being scared [P-8], correctly notes current smoking at ~5 cigarettes/day and that quitting is hard [P-14, P-13], and correctly attributes major stress to school workload and mentions prior anxiety attacks [P-13, P-20]. However, it introduces non-transcript elements (“knowledge graph” assertions such as stress → chest pain, family history as a risk factor for chest pain) that are not stated in the consultation, and it somewhat overstates/labels the situation as “high state of health anxiety” (plausible but not explicitly documented). No major contradictions with the Gold Answer, but a few unsupported causal claims and framing choices reduce accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: father’s early heart attack last year and patient fear; smoking is ongoing, reduced, and quitting is stressful; school stress and anxiety context. Key points missed: (1) the additional family-history nuance that paternal grandfather died young from an accident and thus cardiac history is unknown [P-30]; (2) detailed smoking trajectory (started ~18, up to ~10/day for ~2 years, cut down in half a few months ago) [P-18]; (3) specific psychosocial details (Masters thesis/end-of-program time crunch [P-15, P-16], living alone/limited social contact [P-27], nervous about running recently [P-28], and physiologic anxiety response during episodes—breathing faster/makes herself nervous [P-19]). Overall, it captures the broad themes but omits several illustrative consultation details emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements rely on a purported “knowledge graph” (e.g., explicit edges like family history → causes stress; stress → triggers chest pain; family history as a risk factor for chest pain) that do not appear anywhere in the provided transcript. While some of these are clinically plausible and loosely supported by patient statements (she suspects stress [P-8], feels scared due to father’s event [P-8]), they are not verifiable as written. Aside from these, the quoted transcript evidence is accurate. The presence of repeated non-transcript “knowledge graph” claims lowers grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with her heart-disease concern, and it provides transcript quotes for several points. The “knowledge graph” discussion is a minor distraction but still tied to the question’s requested connections. Overall, it remains focused on the asked factors and their interaction."
