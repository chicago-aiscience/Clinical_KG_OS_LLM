  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three key symptoms: dry cough, fever >100°F, and loss of taste. It accurately captures the doctor's reasoning in D-45 about fever differentiating infection from asthma. However, it slightly misquotes D-44 as 'compatible with symptoms of covid' when the transcript says 'aligned with symptoms of covid.' The core facts align with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components: (1) the three-symptom triad, (2) the fever's role in differentiating infection from asthma, (3) COVID-19 alignment, and (4) the testing/isolation decision. However, it lacks some details present in the Gold Answer such as the specific timeline ('three days'), the systemic involvement mention (fatigue, decreased appetite as distinct points), and the specific quote 'right now it sounds like an infection' from D-45. It covers approximately 85% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer correctly references P-1, P-2, P-17, D-44, and D-45. The slight misquote ('compatible' vs 'aligned') is minor and doesn't constitute hallucination. The 'knowledge graph logic' phrase in the summary is interpretive but not contradictory to the transcript. Overall, the answer is well-grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses how the symptom combination led to COVID-19 alignment and the conclusion of infectious process. The structure follows the question's two-part format. The summary section adds slight repetition but stays on-topic. No significant tangents or irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the key symptom triad and correctly explains the doctor's reasoning about fever differentiating infection from non-infectious conditions. It provides appropriate transcript citations and stays highly relevant to the question. Minor deductions for a small misquote and omission of some contextual details like specific timeline and the exact D-45 quote, but overall demonstrates strong alignment with the Gold Answer."
