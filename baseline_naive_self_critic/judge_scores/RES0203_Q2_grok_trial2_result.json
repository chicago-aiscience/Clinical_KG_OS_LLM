  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly states no prior medications or treatments tried by the patient, aligning with Gold (P-9/D-9, P-24/D-24), though it cites P-1 instead of precise locations. Doctor's recommendation of COVID-19 test swab matches, with instructions on timing and self-isolation accurate per D-39. Minor discrepancy: specifies 'nasal swab' (not explicit in transcript/Gold) and omits no medication prescribed explicitly. Core facts consistent, no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: no prior treatments (partial citation), COVID test recommendation [D-39], results timing [D-39], self-isolation instructions including post-negative [D-39]. Missed: explicit P-9 quote, no regular meds [D-24/P-24], no medication prescribed, possible other tests/consult supervising doc [D-40]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: no treatments (true, though P-1 citation indirect), test/swab/instructions directly from D-39. 'Nasal swab' plausible for COVID but not specified in transcript (minor addition). '[Knowledge Graph]' citation unverifiable/not in transcript (hallucination). Citations mostly accurate, minor issues.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structured around prior treatments and doctor's recommendation/intervention/instructions, perfectly matching question with no off-topic content."
