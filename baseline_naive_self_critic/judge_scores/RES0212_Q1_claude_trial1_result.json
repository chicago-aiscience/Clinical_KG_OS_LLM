  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple significant factual errors when compared to the Gold Answer. It states the cough lasted 'approximately one month' when the Gold Answer correctly identifies 'approximately three months' from [P-2]. It omits critical information about the cough's progression (initially dry and intermittent, becoming productive only in the last three days). It fails to mention the cough waking her up 'nightly for the last month' as specified in [P-19, P-20, P-21]. The Generated Answer also provides incomplete symptom denial information, only mentioning [P-5] and [P-6] without specifying what was denied, while the Gold Answer comprehensively lists all denied symptoms including night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, body pain, and sick contacts.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 40% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It mentions cough, chest pain, sputum characteristics, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, but misses: the three-month duration, the cough's initial dry/intermittent nature, the three-day timeline for productive cough, the pole dancing class context, absence of blood in sputum, absence of foul smell, nightly awakening pattern for the last month, subjective fevers, exercise impairment, and most critically, the comprehensive list of explicitly denied symptoms. The denial section is particularly incomplete, providing only vague references to [P-5] and [P-6] without identifying what was denied.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer shows moderate hallucination issues. It incorrectly states the cough lasted 'approximately one month' when [P-1] and [P-2] clearly indicate three months with recent worsening. The claim about 'Knowledge Graph linkage where cough causes chest pain' is not verifiable in the provided transcript. The denial section cites [P-5] and [P-6] but fails to specify what was denied (night sweats and weight loss respectively), making these citations technically accurate but functionally unhelpful. Most claims are grounded in the transcript but the duration error and vague denial documentation represent significant faithfulness issues.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is mostly relevant to the question but has notable gaps. It addresses respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum) and associated symptoms (chest pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance) as requested. However, the denial section is inadequately addressed - while the question explicitly asks 'which symptoms did she explicitly deny when asked by the doctor,' the answer only provides passage numbers without identifying the denied symptoms. The answer stays on topic throughout but fails to fully satisfy all components of the question, particularly the comprehensive denial documentation that was specifically requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors, most notably misstating the cough duration as one month instead of three months, and failing to describe the progression from dry/intermittent to productive. It covers less than half of the key points from the Gold Answer, particularly omitting the comprehensive list of denied symptoms that was explicitly requested in the question. The denial section only provides vague passage references without identifying what was denied. While most content is grounded in the transcript, the duration error and incomplete denial documentation represent major deficiencies. The answer remains generally relevant but inadequately addresses the 'explicitly denied symptoms' component of the question."
