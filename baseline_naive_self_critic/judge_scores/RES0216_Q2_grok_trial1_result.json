  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer correctly identifies the three medications (Ramipril for high blood pressure, Salbutamol for asthma, Tylenol for headaches) matching Gold Answer and transcript citations. Conditions are accurate per patient statements. Adherence changes are partially correct: notes 'limiting' medication over couple years [D-34], aligning with Gold, but lacks specifics on daily inhaler dosing (skipping evening dose, now morning only [P-19]) and inaccurately frames rescue inhaler as a future plan [D-35] rather than patient's past non-refill/no availability for years [P-17/18]. No major contradictions, minor discrepancies in detail and omission.",
    "completeness": "Covers all three medications and their conditions (100%). For adherence: covers general 'limiting' [D-34] and mentions rescue but incorrectly as future provision rather than past change; misses key points like prescribed BID but now only morning [P-19], no issues with reduced dose [P-20], no recent stoppage [P-19], and explicit gaps (halved maintenance, no rescue available). Covers ~60% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Meds and conditions verifiable in transcript [P-16/24-27]. 'Limiting' directly from [D-34]. Rescue reference twists [D-35] (future plan) from patient's history [P-17/18]. 'Knowledge graph' mentioned twice is hallucinated/not in transcript. Mostly grounded with minor unverifiable additions (knowledge graph plausible but fabricated) and interpretive stretch on rescue.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses medications/conditions and adherence changes with structured response matching question components. Minor off-topic: external 'knowledge graph' and future doctor plan tangent from patient's past changes."
