  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the primary condition to rule out, correctly specifies that a swab test was ordered, correctly states the expected turnaround time as 24–48 hours, and correctly notes the alternative diagnosis as another viral illness if COVID testing is negative. These match the Gold Answer and transcript (D-52). No contradictory or incorrect statements are present.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer includes all elements required by the question and present in the Gold Answer: (1) rule out COVID-19, (2) swab test, (3) 24–48 hour turnaround, and (4) alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative. It does not mention isolation/contact tracing/supportive management, but those are not asked for in the question; all asked-for key points are fully covered.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly supported by the transcript (D-52). The answer uses accurate paraphrases/quotes and does not introduce details not present in the source.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question components (condition to rule out, test, turnaround time, alternative diagnosis) with no tangential content."
