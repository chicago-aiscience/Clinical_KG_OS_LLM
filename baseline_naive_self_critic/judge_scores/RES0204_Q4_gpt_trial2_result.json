  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the condition considered and ruled out, consistent with the Gold Answer. It also correctly reports the key supporting negatives that the mother cited: no shortness of breath and no wheezing, even with physical activity (from P-28). However, it incorrectly uses “no fever/chills” as part of the rationale for ruling out asthma; those findings are not part of the asthma discussion in the Gold Answer and are not specifically cited by the mother to exclude asthma. It also mis-cites the family history of asthma as [P-13] rather than [P-28] (though the family-history fact itself is true).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) asthma ruled out; (2) positive family history in grandparents; (3) absence of shortness of breath; (4) absence of wheeze; (5) absence of these symptoms even with physical activity.\nKey points missed: (1) mother’s statement that he has “been worked up for that” (prior evaluation with negative results); (2) mother’s definitive conclusion “he doesn’t have that”; (3) the additional differentiating history that he’s been “pretty healthy otherwise” and hasn’t had a dry cough like this before (P-24).",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is grounded in the transcript: no SOB/wheeze with activity is explicitly stated in P-28; absence of fever/chills is stated in P-13. The answer’s claim about grandparents having asthma is supported by P-28, but the provided citation ([P-13]) is incorrect. The statement about “genetic risk factor” is an inference rather than an explicit transcript statement, but it is plausible and not central.",
    "relevance": "The response largely addresses the question (condition ruled out and the mother-cited negatives, including during physical activity). The added fever/chills point is a minor tangent and not part of the asthma-ruling-out rationale asked for."
