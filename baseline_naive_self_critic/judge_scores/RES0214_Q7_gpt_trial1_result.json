  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the first symptom as a stuffy nose, followed by fever present for three days at presentation, with sore throat ongoing and muscle aches present. These elements align with the Gold Answer and transcript. Minor imprecision: it does not explicitly state that the sore throat developed after the stuffy nose and around fever onset (it mentions it as ongoing but not clearly sequenced), and it does not specify the muscle-ache duration as “past 2–3 days” or explicitly tie it to fever onset (though it implies later occurrence). The husband comparison is directionally correct (husband sick ~1 week, earlier than patient), but it does not state the inferred ~4-day lead relative to her fever onset as in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key points: (1) stuffy nose first, (2) fever followed and has lasted 3 days, (3) sore throat present/ongoing, (4) muscle aches present, (5) husband has similar symptoms for ~1 week and started earlier. Missing/underdeveloped points from Gold: explicit sequencing of sore throat as the next symptom and its timing relative to fever; explicit muscle-ache timeframe (2–3 days) and clear statement that it coincided with fever; explicit inference that husband started ~4 days before her fever onset; does not mention clinician noting household transmission (a contextual point in Gold).",
    "faithfulness": "All statements are grounded in the transcript: stuffy nose and fever timeline from P-1/P-2/P-3; sore throat from P-1; muscle aches from P-13; husband’s similar symptoms for a week from P-19. No clear hallucinated symptoms or unsupported claims. The only mild issue is wording (“just before the onset of her illness”) which could be read as broader than “just before the fever,” but it remains consistent with the transcript context.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question by describing symptom progression and comparing the patient’s timeline to her husband’s onset. No major tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate, well-grounded, and relevant, but slightly underspecifies the sore-throat and myalgia timing and the husband-vs-patient timeline inference compared with the Gold Answer."
