  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies fever and sore throat as the key symptoms prompting concern for an infectious etiology/COVID-19 (consistent with D-53 and the Gold Answer). It also correctly states that the doctor raised influenza after learning the patient had not received a flu shot this year (P-53/D-54, consistent with the Gold Answer). However, it contains an internal factual/citation error by attributing the flu-shot “No” response to P-27 (which is actually about neck swelling), and it adds an unsupported claim about a “knowledge graph” corroborating COVID indicators.",
    "completeness": "It covers: (1) fever and sore throat as infectious red flags; (2) lack of flu shot prompting influenza on the differential. It misses key Gold Answer elements: (a) the broader symptom cluster noted by the doctor (muscle aches, stuffy nose) supporting viral illness; and (b) the epidemiologic context that the husband had similar symptoms, which the doctor explicitly used to prioritize ruling out COVID-19 first.",
    "faithfulness": "Some content is grounded in the transcript (fever/sore throat; asked about flu shot; patient said no). But it includes non-transcript material (“knowledge graph” support) and a clearly incorrect citation (P-27) for flu-shot status. These issues reduce groundedness, even though the underlying flu-shot fact is present elsewhere (P-53).",
    "relevance": "The response largely addresses exactly what was asked (symptoms leading to infectious/COVID suspicion and the vaccination-history detail leading to influenza consideration). Minor irrelevant material about a knowledge graph and some imprecise phrasing slightly detract from focus."
