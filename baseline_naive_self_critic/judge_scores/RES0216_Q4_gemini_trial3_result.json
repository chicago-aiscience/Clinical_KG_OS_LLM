  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (cardiac ischemia) and the absence of pain. However, it incorrectly lists 'difficulty breathing' as a symptom finding used to deprioritize the condition, whereas the transcript (D-36) and the gold answer show the doctor cited the *absence* of significant breathlessness ('didn't really get out of breath with exercise') as evidence against a cardiac picture. The generated answer also claims the lack of pain 'rules out' the diagnosis, which is a stronger claim than the transcript's 'lower on the differential.'",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer. It fails to mention the absence of anxiety, sweating, and the feeling of impending doom (P-6), which the doctor explicitly screened for and the gold answer includes as evidence. It also misses the distinction between tightness and classic exertional dyspnea used as reasoning by the doctor.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information. No knowledge graph was provided in the context; only a 'Source Transcript' was available. The claims about the knowledge graph 'ruling out' the diagnosis are not grounded in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing the specific condition and the requested symptom findings, although it fails to capture all of them."
