  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes Claritin (carrying but not currently taking for seasonal allergies) and allergy shots (frequency from allergist), consistent with Gold and transcript. However, it completely omits the birth control medication 'Deyo' (taken regularly as a 3-month oral contraceptive pill), which is a key current medication explicitly stated by the patient [P-25, P-26, P-27] and included in Gold Answer. It also misses denial of medication allergies and no EpiPen, leading to significant factual gaps in representing all current medications.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: Claritin details (carrying 'just in case', not taking now, seasonal allergies) ~100%; allergy shots (name, indication, frequency 'once a week for a little while in winter') ~70% (misses 'some years'). Missed entirely: Deyo birth control (name, indication, dosing 'three months pill', confirmed oral not IUD); no medication allergies; no EpiPen; allergies are seasonal without severe symptoms. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: Claritin carrying/usage [P-25], allergies [P-16]; shots frequency [P-20]. Citations accurate (P-16, P-25, P-20). No hallucinations; 'no specific dosing for current supply' true for Claritin. Minor note: mentions 'knowledge graph provided' but none in input—still grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question by structuring response around current medications/carrying (Claritin) and past allergist treatments (shots), with names, indications, dosing/frequency, and citations. No off-topic content; perfectly focused despite incompleteness."
