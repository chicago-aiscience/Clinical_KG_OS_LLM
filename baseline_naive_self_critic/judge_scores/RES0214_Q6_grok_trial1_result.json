  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies COVID swab, self-isolation for patient and husband, physical exam as next step [D-52], and consulting the supervising doctor before returning [D-55]. Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID swab [D-53] and self-isolation for patient and husband [D-53, D-54]. However, it inaccurately presents the swab as the 'immediate next step' (contradicting [D-52]'s physical exam), omits the physical exam and consult entirely, introduces 'social distancing' as separate from isolation (minor rephrasing of [D-54]), and states 'ruling out influenza' as a subsequent step (plausible from [D-54] but not explicitly planned in Gold or transcript as a discrete action). Some factual errors in next steps, but core test and isolation correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) COVID swab (covered), 2) self-isolation patient+husband (covered), 3) physical exam next (missed), 4) consult supervising doctor/return (missed), 5) patient agreement (missed, minor). Generated covers swab and isolation (~50% of major points), misses two key next steps, partially covers precautions with extra phrasing. Covers 50-79% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All citations accurate ([D-53, D-54]). Claims like COVID swab, self-isolate patient+husband directly verifiable. 'Keep to herself' [D-54] supports precautions. Swab as 'immediate next step' not verifiable (transcript prioritizes physical exam [D-52]). 'Ruling out influenza after COVID' plausible from [D-54] context but not explicit plan. No major hallucinations, minor interpretive stretches.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around question elements (test ordered, precautionary measures for patient+husband, next steps), uses bold headings matching query, no off-topic content, fully focused."
