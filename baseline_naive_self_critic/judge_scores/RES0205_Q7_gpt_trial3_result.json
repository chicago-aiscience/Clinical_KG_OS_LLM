  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Most stated facts align with the Gold Answer: cough duration ~2 weeks; initial flu-like symptoms in first couple days; whitish/clear mucus early; mucus present for ~first 4–5 days; transition to dry cough after day 4–5; other non-cough symptoms resolved by ~day 3–4; chest soreness after coughing. Minor issues: the sectioning \"Mucus Phase (Days 4–5)\" is potentially misleading (mucus was present over the first 4–5 days, not only on days 4–5), and it refers to a \"knowledge graph\" and frames chest pain a bit imprecisely (patient denied chest pain except soreness after coughing).",
    "completeness": "Captured key elements: 2-week cough duration; early flu-like symptoms; mucus description (whitish/clear) and duration (4–5 days); transition from productive to dry; other symptoms resolving by 3–4 days; cough-related chest soreness. Missed several Gold Answer elements requested in the question: sore throat timing and resolution (2–3 days); runny nose specifically; explicit statement that cough intensity stayed the same over 2 weeks; cough frequency stayed stable and estimate (3–4 times/hour); spontaneous/no triggers; no fever at any point; COVID test negative at onset; stayed home awaiting resolution before return to work.",
    "faithfulness": "The majority of claims are grounded in the transcript. However, the mention of a \"knowledge graph\" is not supported by the transcript, and calling the soreness \"chest pain\" without clarifying the patient’s denial of chest pain except with excessive coughing slightly weakens grounding. No major hallucinated clinical events, but a few minor unverifiable/overstated details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is largely focused on the requested symptom timeline (onset, mucus duration/appearance, transition to dry cough, resolution of other symptoms). However, it incompletely addresses the question’s requested evolution of cough intensity and frequency over time (which are explicitly in the Gold Answer). No major irrelevant tangents beyond the brief \"knowledge graph\" framing."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and on-topic but misses multiple specific timeline details (notably sore throat/runny nose course, fever absence, cough frequency/intensity stability, and COVID test/home isolation), with minor grounding issues (\"knowledge graph\" mention and imprecise chest pain wording)."
