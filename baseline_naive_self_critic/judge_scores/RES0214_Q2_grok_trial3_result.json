  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states the medication regimen as multivitamins only [P-40], matching the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the penicillin allergy [P-37] and rash reaction [P-38], consistent with Gold. The parenthetical note on 'knowledge graph' is extraneous but does not introduce factual errors relative to Gold or transcript. No contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: multivitamins only [P-40], penicillin allergy [P-37], rash [P-38]. Missed: pre-diabetic status and glucose monitoring [P-33] with no Rx meds, denial of HBP [P-34]/cholesterol [P-35], no trouble breathing [P-39], distinction of reaction type, and clinical relevance. Covers core ~80% but omits contextual details.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims on meds [P-40], allergy [P-37], and rash [P-38] are directly verifiable in transcript. The 'knowledge graph' reference is not in transcript, introducing a minor hallucinated detail.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer uses bullet points to directly address the three-part question (meds, allergy, reaction) with no off-topic content."
