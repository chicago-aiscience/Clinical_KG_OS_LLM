  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 suspicion, the two diagnostic tests (COVID swab and chest X-ray), and the isolation instructions including the conditional requirement for continued isolation if symptoms persist even with a negative test. All facts align with the transcript citations.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) assessment of COVID-19 suspicion, (2) both diagnostic tests specified, (3) isolation until results return, and (4) continued isolation if symptomatic despite negative test. It also includes the relevant COPD history. However, it omits minor contextual details like the doctor's plan to consult with the supervising physician and return with next steps, and the patient's acknowledgment.",

The COVID-19 suspicion [D-43], both diagnostic tests [D-43], isolation instructions [D-43], and COPD history [P-27] are all properly grounded. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: overall assessment, management plan, specific diagnostic tests, isolation instructions, and conditions for continued isolation. The content is well-organized and focused, with no irrelevant information."
