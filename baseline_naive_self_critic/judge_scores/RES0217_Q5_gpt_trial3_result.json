  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly explains the timeline logic for estimating >72 hours (hiking Friday + gardening Saturday + removal “earlier today,” leading the clinician to state “longer than at least 72 hours” [D-6]). However, it is factually wrong in stating there is no discussion of an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map or Strathroy’s position on it. The transcript explicitly includes the doctor referencing the map and concluding “Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point,” supporting antibiotics [D-13]. This is a major contradiction of the source and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) patient outdoors Friday/Saturday and clinician’s >72-hour estimate [P-1, D-6]. Misses/incorrectly denies: (2) doctor’s use of the Ontario Lyme distribution map; (3) conclusion that Strathroy’s map position added geographic risk supporting prophylaxis/antibiotics [D-13]. Also omits the doctor’s intermediate reasoning that it had been some time since last outdoors to noticing the tick [D-2], which is part of the Gold Answer narrative.",
    "faithfulness": "Most quoted elements about the timeline are grounded in the transcript. But the answer’s claim that the transcript does not contain evidence of map discussion is directly contradicted by [D-13], where the map is explicitly mentioned and used to justify antibiotics. This constitutes a significant unfaithfulness to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on the two parts of the question (duration estimate and geographic/map justification). Despite being wrong about the map discussion, it remains on-topic and attempts to address both components."
