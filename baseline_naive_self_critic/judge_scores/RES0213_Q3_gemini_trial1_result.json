  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer identifies a psychological etiology, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it labels the condition as 'Conversion Disorder,' which typically refers to functional neurological symptoms (motor/sensory loss) rather than chest pain. The Gold Answer more accurately identifies it as 'anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain.' The Generated Answer also misses the specific clinical nuance regarding breathing mechanics mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the patient's history of anxiety and current academic stress. However, it fails to include several key points from the Gold Answer: the specific breathing patterns (fast breathing, difficulty taking deep breaths due to nervousness), the patient's own suspicion of stress, and crucial pertinent negatives (no fever, no exertional worsening, pain occurring at rest, no asthma).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations by repeatedly referencing a 'knowledge graph' which is not present in the provided transcript or context. It attributes specific links and logic to this non-existent graph.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in that it directly addresses the question of diagnosis and clinical observations, though it relies on hallucinated sources to do so."
