  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer includes onset symptoms: SOB, fatigue/rundown/tired/weakness, reduced appetite, body aches (unspecified onset). Generated covers SOB, fatigue/rundown/tired, weakness, appetite but misses body aches. Recent: Gold has fever (yesterday), Generated matches. Morning: Gold has loss of taste and diminished smell (new); Generated has taste but misses smell. Emerging: Gold has dry cough 'on its way' and sore throat 'starting'; Generated has dry throat pre-cough (cites P-8 cough), dry cough (cites P-8,P-9 sore throat) – minor misattribution but facts align. Gold notes headaches (not new); Generated omits. Breathing details match. Core timeline facts consistent, minor omissions/discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: onset SOB/fatigue/weakness/appetite (4/5, misses aches); recent fever (yes); morning taste (yes, misses smell); emerging cough (yes), sore throat implied but not explicit (partial); omits headaches. Covers ~85% of key points including details and citations.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from transcript: SOB/fatigue [P-1,P-2,P-3], weakness/appetite [P-2], fever/taste [P-4], cough [P-7,P-8], emerging throat/cough [P-8,P-9]. Citations accurate except minor stretch of P-9 (sore throat) to cough, but patient describes emerging symptoms there. No hallucinations; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly reconstructs timeline in three categories matching question (onset couple days ago, recent like fever yesterday/taste morning, emerging at consultation). Structured, focused, no off-topic content."
