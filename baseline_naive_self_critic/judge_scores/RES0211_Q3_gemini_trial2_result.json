  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely consistent with the Gold Answer regarding the interpretation of symptoms. However, it incorrectly identifies 'tiredness' as a proxy for subjective fever, whereas the transcript (and the Gold Answer) contains a direct report of the patient 'feeling really hot' [P-7]. It correctly identifies the absence of sputum and systemic symptoms as supporting a URI diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points present in the Gold Answer: the 3-4 day symptom timeline, the specific household exposure (the brother having a cold), and the doctor's summary of the case. These are significant elements in supporting a clinical assessment of a viral URI.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are well-grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. The only minor issue is the clinical interpretation that fatigue is a 'proxy' for fever when the fever itself was explicitly reported by the patient, making the proxy argument unnecessary and slightly unfaithful to the direct evidence.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly focused on the question, addressing each symptom and absence mentioned in the prompt. It adds a section on excluding allergies which, while not specifically requested, is clinically relevant to the differential diagnosis of a URI."
