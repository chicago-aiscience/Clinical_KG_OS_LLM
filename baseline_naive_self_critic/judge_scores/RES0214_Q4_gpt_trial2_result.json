  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The diagnostic test is correct: the doctor ordered a COVID swab (“we’ll be ordering a covid swab no matter what” [D-53]).\n\nHowever, the rationale for prioritizing COVID over influenza is only partly correct. The generated answer attributes the prioritization mainly to the patient’s symptoms (fever and sore throat) and a general need to rule out infectious causes. In the transcript, the doctor’s explicit reason for COVID being first is the apparent household transmission pattern (“if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out” [D-53]), plus the need for isolation while awaiting rule-out. So the key rationale is misstated/underspecified, though it does correctly quote that COVID is the first thing to rule out.",
    "completeness": "Included:\n- COVID swab test ordered.\n- Statement that COVID is the first thing to rule out (via quote).\n\nMissed key Gold Answer points:\n- The specific reason COVID was prioritized: husband with similar symptoms suggesting household spread.\n- The public-health/containment reasoning: instruction to self-isolate while ruling out COVID ([D-53], [D-54]).\n- That influenza was discussed as a secondary possibility after COVID discussion and after learning she lacked a flu shot.\n\nOverall coverage is partial (roughly ~50–70% of what Gold emphasized).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in [D-53] (COVID swab; fever/sore throat presentation; rule out infectious; COVID first to rule out). The added phrasing that fever and sore throat are “specific symptoms associated with infectious diseases” is a generalization not explicitly stated, but it does not introduce concrete false details. No major hallucinations, but it omits the transcript’s main explicit rationale (household transmission) and replaces it with a less-supported emphasis on symptoms.",
    "relevance": "The answer stays focused on the two requested items (test ordered and rationale for prioritizing COVID over influenza) without irrelevant tangents."
