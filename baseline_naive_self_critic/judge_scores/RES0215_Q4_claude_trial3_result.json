    "correctness": "The Generated Answer begins with a false claim that the specific screening questions are 'not present in the transcript,' when they clearly are (D-7, D-8, D-10, D-11, D-13, D-31, D-14). The GA then pivots to discuss seasonal allergies as the primary differential, which was not the focus of the question. The Gold Answer correctly identifies that these screening questions aimed to exclude infectious and systemic conditions, with all negative responses narrowing toward reactive airway disease (likely asthma). The GA misidentifies the conditions being screened for and provides incorrect reasoning about what the doctor was attempting to accomplish.",
    "completeness": "The GA fails to address most of the key screening questions mentioned in the question prompt (fever, runny nose, sick contacts, recent travel, rashes, phlegm production) and their specific patient responses. It omits the systematic exclusion of infectious causes (pneumonia, bronchitis, URTI), the screening for systemic conditions through rash inquiry, the differentiation between productive and non-productive cough, and the pain inquiry for pleuritic/musculoskeletal causes. The GA covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer, focusing instead on seasonal allergies which was not the primary focus of the screening questions.",
    "faithfulness": "The GA contains a significant factual error in claiming the screening questions are 'not present' in the transcript when they clearly are. However, the subsequent discussion of seasonal allergies and activity triggers is grounded in the transcript (P-35, P-36, P-38, P-3). The interpretation that the doctor was primarily screening for viral infection versus seasonal allergies is not supported by the Gold Answer's analysis, which indicates the doctor was systematically excluding infectious and systemic causes to narrow toward reactive airway disease. This represents a misinterpretation rather than pure hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The GA partially addresses the question but focuses heavily on seasonal allergies as a differential diagnosis rather than directly answering what conditions the screening questions were meant to exclude. The question specifically asked about the conditions screened for through fever, runny nose, sick contacts, travel, rashes, and phlegm inquiries, but the GA sidesteps this to discuss a different clinical reasoning pathway. About 40% of the content is directly relevant to the actual question asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains a critical error in claiming the screening questions are absent from the transcript, when they are clearly present. It then provides an alternative interpretation focusing on seasonal allergies versus viral infection, missing the Gold Answer's key point that these questions systematically excluded infectious and systemic causes to narrow toward reactive airway disease. The GA fails to address the specific patient responses to each screening question and omits most key diagnostic exclusions mentioned in the Gold Answer. While some content is grounded in the transcript, the overall interpretation is misaligned with the correct clinical reasoning demonstrated in the Gold Answer."
