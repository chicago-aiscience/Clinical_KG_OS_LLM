  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the primary diagnosis and cardiac ischemia as a lower priority. It accurately notes the physical exam plan (listening to lungs) and the contingency plan (returning to the table). However, it incorrectly states the patient should use 'existing' rescue puffers. The transcript (P-17, P-18) and the Gold Answer both explicitly state that the patient no longer has these puffers and needs to obtain them.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points: assessment, physical exam, initial treatment, and contingency. It misses one detail from the Gold Answer: the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician ('the doc') before finalizing the plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the patient should use 'existing' puffers is a minor hallucination or misinterpretation of the transcript, as the patient confirmed he had not refilled his prescription and currently lacks them. The rest of the answer is well-grounded in the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses all parts of the multi-part prompt in a clear, structured format."
