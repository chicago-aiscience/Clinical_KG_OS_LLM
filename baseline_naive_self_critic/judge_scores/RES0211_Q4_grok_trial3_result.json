  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the relevant transcript sections for screening conditions like night sweats, asthma, eczema, EpiPen allergies are missing, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and the full transcript provided (e.g., D-9/P-9 for night sweats, D-29/P-29 for asthma, D-21/P-21 for EpiPen, D-32/P-33 for eczema). No facts align with Gold Answer's detailed screenings and responses.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers key screenings (night sweats, productive cough, allergies/EpiPen, asthma personal/family, eczema family, rashes, GI, joints) with citations and responses; Generated covers 0% of these, instead listing unrelated symptoms and general history.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated hallucinates absence of key transcript sections that are explicitly present (e.g., D-5/6, D-9, D-18/21, D-29-33); while some symptom summaries are verifiable (P-1, P-16), the core denial is fabricated and ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated explicitly refuses to address the question about specific screened conditions and Jessica's responses, pivoting to unrelated symptoms and history, failing to engage with the query."
