  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the three key symptoms (worsening cough citing P-1, increased dyspnea citing P-1 and P-8, sputum changes citing P-6) matching the Gold Answer's symptoms (worsening cough [P-1,P-5], sputum [P-6], dyspnea [P-8]). It correctly notes the COPD history and quotes the doctor's linking statement from [D-52] verbatim, consistent with Gold. Minor citation difference (P-1 vs. P-5 for cough) but factually identical as both support worsening.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: three symptoms with citations, COPD history (5 years [P-2]), inhalers [P-11], doctor's synthesis [D-52]. Generated covers all three symptoms with accurate citations (minor variance), COPD history, and full linking quote from [D-52]. Misses exact COPD duration and inhaler names, but these are supporting details; core combination and linkage fully covered (100%).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: symptoms match patient statements [P-1,P-5-P-8,P-6]; doctor's quote exact from [D-52]. No unverifiable or hallucinated content; citations precise to transcript.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by specifying the exact symptom combination (worsening cough, sputum changes, increased dyspnea) + COPD history, and detailing the doctor's linkage via baseline comparison and explicit conclusion in [D-52]. Structured response with no tangents."
