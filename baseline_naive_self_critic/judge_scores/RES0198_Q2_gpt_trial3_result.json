  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately matches the Gold Answer on the three core requested items: (1) the patient tried OTC decongestants, (2) the patient thought they “worked a little bit,” and (3) the clinician recommended an OTC product like Tylenol Cold. No contradictions or factual errors relative to the transcript/Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include: (a) tried OTC decongestants, (b) effect was ambiguous but described as helping “a little bit” as congestion shifted to runny nose, (c) recommended supportive care and OTC meds like Tylenol Cold, plus (d) hydration and (e) expectation of a few weeks for resolution. The generated answer covers (a), (b) (in a simplified form, without noting the ambiguity/rationale), and (c), but omits (d) and (e).",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript: decongestants and “worked a little bit” are in P-10; Tylenol Cold is in D-39. No additional unsupported details are introduced.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on exactly what was asked: what was tried, perceived effectiveness, and what OTC medication was recommended. No tangential or irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The generated answer is accurate, well-grounded, and fully relevant, but slightly less complete than the Gold Answer because it omits the added supportive-care details (hydration and expected duration) and the noted ambiguity/rationale about effectiveness."
