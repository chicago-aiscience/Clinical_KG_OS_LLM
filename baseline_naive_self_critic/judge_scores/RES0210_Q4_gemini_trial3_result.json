  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that there is no evidence in the transcript of the doctor asking about weight loss, travel, sick contacts, or chemical exposure. In reality, the transcript contains these specific questions: weight loss [D-22], travel [D-23], sick contacts [D-24], and chemical exposure [D-34]. This is a fundamental factual error regarding the content of the source text.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 100% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to identify the differential diagnoses associated with the specific questions (such as TB, lung cancer, Legionella, or chemical pneumonitis) because it incorrectly claims the questions were never asked.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a 'negative hallucination' by claiming the absence of information that is explicitly present in the provided transcript. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not part of the provided source material for this evaluation, while ignoring the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the specific prompt. Instead of answering the question about the four specific screenings, it provides a general analysis of other symptoms (cough, chills, chest pain) which was not what the user asked for."
