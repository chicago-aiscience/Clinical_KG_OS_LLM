  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer’s central claim— that the transcript does not contain questioning about asthma, eczema, EpiPen-level allergy, or night sweats— is incorrect. The transcript explicitly includes screening for night sweats [D-9/P-9], severe allergic reactions and EpiPen use [D-18 to D-21/P-18 to P-21], asthma personal/family history [D-29 to D-31/P-29 to P-31], and eczema family history [D-32 to D-33/P-33]. While the Generated Answer does accurately restate some symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache) and allergy history (seasonal allergies, Claritin, allergist shots), it fails to answer the asked content and incorrectly states the relevant section is absent.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include: (1) night sweats question + response (hot all the time, not drenching), (2) productive cough/phlegm denial, (3) severe allergy screening (breathing difficulty/facial swelling) + mild stuffiness only, (4) EpiPen confirmation of not carrying one, (5) asthma personal denial, (6) asthma family history (cousin only), (7) eczema family history denial, plus additional screening (rash, GI symptoms, joint pain). The Generated Answer covers none of these targeted screening items/responses (it only summarizes general symptoms/allergy history). Therefore it captures <20% of the required items.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded (dry cough/scratchy throat; headache; seasonal allergies; Claritin; allergist shots). However, the assertion that the relevant questioning is not present in the provided text is directly contradicted by the transcript. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' that is not part of the transcript. These issues substantially reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically which conditions were systematically screened for via targeted questioning and Jessica’s responses. The Generated Answer largely declines to answer and instead provides a generic symptom/history summary. This is only minimally relevant and does not address the differential-narrowing screening content."
