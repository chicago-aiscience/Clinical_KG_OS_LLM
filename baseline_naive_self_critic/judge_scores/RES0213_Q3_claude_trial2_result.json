    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly diagnoses Conversion Disorder when the Gold Answer correctly identifies anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain. While both involve psychological factors, these are distinct diagnostic categories. Conversion Disorder typically involves neurological symptoms (paralysis, seizures, sensory deficits) rather than chest pain. The Generated Answer mischaracterizes the condition and uses inappropriate terminology like 'Psychogenic Pain Disorder.' The supporting observations overlap with the Gold Answer but lead to an incorrect diagnostic conclusion.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: (1) history of anxiety attacks as a teenager, (2) current academic stress, (3) pain occurrence when alone and resolution with distraction, and (4) fear about family cardiac history. However, it misses several important observations: the specific situational patterns described in P-9 and P-29, the patient's acknowledgment that symptoms 'could maybe' return, the detailed description of breathing pattern changes during episodes, and the comprehensive list of pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, pain at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety, no asthma) that rule out cardiac/pulmonary pathology.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it contains interpretive overreach not supported by the source material. The statement that 'symptom acts as a displaced expression of conflict to gain attention or reduce stress' is not substantiated in the transcript and represents hallucinated psychodynamic interpretation. The reference to 'knowledge graph' multiple times is confusing and not present in the source material, suggesting fabricated framework. The claim about analgesics 'reinforcing the organic nature of the pain is likely ruled out' is backward reasoning not explicitly stated in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question but with significant diagnostic error. It attempts to explain what diagnosis the findings point toward and provides supporting clinical observations as requested. However, by concluding with Conversion Disorder instead of anxiety-related chest pain, it fundamentally misses the mark. The supporting observations are relevant to the question but are marshaled toward an incorrect conclusion. The answer stays focused on the clinical scenario without major tangents, but the core diagnostic error significantly undermines its relevance to what the question actually asks."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant factual errors by diagnosing Conversion Disorder instead of anxiety-related chest pain, which represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the clinical presentation. While it covers about 60% of the key supporting observations from the Gold Answer and remains mostly grounded in the transcript, it contains interpretive overreach including references to a non-existent 'knowledge graph' and unsupported psychodynamic interpretations. The answer addresses the question's structure but arrives at an incorrect diagnostic conclusion, which significantly undermines its clinical utility despite identifying relevant contextual factors like anxiety history and stress."
