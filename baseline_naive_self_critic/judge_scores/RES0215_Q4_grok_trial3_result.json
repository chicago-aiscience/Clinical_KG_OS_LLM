  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the specific questions about fever [D-7], runny nose [D-8], sick contacts [D-10], recent travel [D-11], rashes [D-13], and phlegm production [D-31] are 'not present' in the transcript, which is a direct factual error as they are explicitly there with patient denials [P-7, P-8, P-10, P-11, P-13, P-31]. It misattributes the doctor's intent to screening for seasonal allergies vs. viral infections based on other history, contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate identification of screenings for infectious causes (e.g., pneumonia, URI, contagious infections) and systemic conditions. No alignment with Gold's narrowing to reactive airway disease via negatives.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers: fever screening infectious (pneumonia/bronchitis), runny nose (URI/viral wheeze), sick contacts (contagious), travel (exposure), rashes (systemic/allergic/viral), phlegm (productive infection), plus pain and other negatives narrowing differential. Generated Answer covers 0% of these key points, instead discussing unrelated seasonal allergies [P-35/36/38], activity triggers [P-3], and past virals [P-15], ignoring the specified questions entirely.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates absence of exact questions listed in query/transcript, references non-existent 'knowledge graph,' and fabricates clinical reasoning (allergies vs. viral) not tied to queried questions; while it cites some transcript parts correctly (e.g., [P-35]), core claims about missing dialogue and diagnostic narrowing are unverifiable and contradicted by transcript.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks about conditions screened via the listed questions (fever, runny nose, etc.) and patient responses narrowing diagnosis; Generated Answer denies their presence and pivots to unrelated allergy/viral differential from other history, failing to address the query directly."
