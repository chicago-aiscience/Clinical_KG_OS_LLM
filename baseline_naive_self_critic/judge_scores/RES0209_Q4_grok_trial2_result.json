  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer details specific infectious symptoms screened (colds/infections, taste/smell loss, fevers, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, dry cough) and exposures (sick contacts at home/frequent, outside home, travel), all denied, with COVID swab planned. Generated Answer incorrectly focuses on asthma triggers (cold weather, pollen, pets, exercise, wheezing) as 'screening to rule out infection,' which contradicts the transcript's explicit infectious screening in D-21 to D-28. It misstates diagnostic test as bronchodilator increase instead of COVID swab. No facts match Gold; entirely incorrect interpretation.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 6 infectious symptoms/exposures listed with citations and denials; purpose explanation (D-29); COVID swab planned despite negatives (D-29). Generated covers 0% of these—instead lists unrelated asthma/environmental triggers (cold, pollen, pets, exercise) and wrong test (bronchodilator). Missed all infectious screening points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated cites transcript snippets (P-9, P-11, P-39) but hallucinates their purpose as 'screening for infection' (they are asthma history, not infectious); claims 'implied negative screening for infection not captured' despite explicit D-21-D-28 coverage; misattributes pets/exercise as infectious exposure screening; fabricates diagnostic test as bronchodilator (transcript shows screening leads to COVID swab plan). Multiple misinterpretations and hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Question asks specifically for infectious (incl. COVID) symptoms/exposure screening to rule out infection, patient responses, and planned diagnostic test (COVID swab). Generated addresses unrelated asthma triggers/environmental history, ignoring infectious screen entirely; off-topic and does not answer the question."
