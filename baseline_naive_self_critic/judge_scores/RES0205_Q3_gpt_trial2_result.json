  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis, consistent with the patient’s statement “I have had the covid test and I don't have it” [P-35]. It accurately cites the key prompting features present in the transcript (hospital worker status [P-34], initial flu-like symptoms with sore throat/runny nose [P-13, P-14], persistent cough [P-2], and workplace concern [P-35]) and correctly states the test result was negative [P-35]. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer were introduced.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) Diagnosis = COVID-19; (2) rationale: hospital worker/occupational exposure, viral/flu-like symptoms, persistent cough; (3) workplace pressure/coworkers’ concern; (4) test negative. \nKey points missed vs Gold Answer: (a) timing of test (performed ~2 weeks ago at symptom onset [P-36]); (b) patient reports wearing PPE/being careful at work [P-17]; (c) patient stayed home after testing while awaiting symptom improvement before returning to work [P-36]. Overall coverage is strong but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are supported by the transcript: persistent cough [P-2], initial flu-like symptoms incl. sore throat/runny nose [P-13, P-14], hospital clerk role [P-34], coworkers scared [P-35], COVID test negative [P-35]. No clear hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated, what prompted it, and what testing revealed. No irrelevant tangents."
