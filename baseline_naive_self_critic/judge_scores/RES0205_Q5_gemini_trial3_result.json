  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer provides clinically plausible links for reflux (LPR) and hay fever (post-nasal drip). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the occupational factor: it suggests the work environment 'prevented the necessary recovery time,' whereas the transcript [P-36] explicitly states the patient has been at home for two weeks since symptoms started. It also misses the Gold Answer's observation that the patient's reflux is currently unmedicated.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses all three requested factors (reflux, hay fever, occupation). It misses some nuances from the Gold Answer, such as the patient's use of PPE [P-17] which mitigates occupational risk, and the specific mention of the patient's anxiety/social motivation for seeking care.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph' as a source of information, which was not provided in the context. Additionally, the claim that the patient's work environment prevented recovery time is not grounded in the transcript and is contradicted by the patient's statement that they have been home.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing each component of the prompt with specific headers and clinical explanations."
