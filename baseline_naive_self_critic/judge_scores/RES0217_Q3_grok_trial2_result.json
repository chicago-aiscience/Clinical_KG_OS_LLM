  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), tick attachment duration (>72 hours), prior history (10-year-old tick bite with bullseye rash treated with antibiotics), and notes the despite clauses (not deer tick, no current rash). Minor discrepancies include misrepresenting geographic risk assessment as general tick habitats from activities [D-18] instead of specific Strathroy location and Lyme map [D-13, P-12]; interpreting prior history as 'known susceptibility' (not stated); incorrect citation for 'safer than not' quote (D-18 not D-6); omission of patient's comment on all ticks as carriers [P-5]. Core facts align with Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: exposure history [P-1], duration [D-6], prior history [P-3], despite not deer tick [P-5] and no rash [P-6]. Missed or incomplete: specific geographic detail (Strathroy creek [P-12], map assessment [D-13]), patient's awareness of all ticks as potential carriers [P-5], sending tick to lab [D-6, D-18]. Covers ~80-90% of key points, structured around the four factors.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: citations [P-1, D-6, P-3] accurate; 'safer than not' paraphrase verifiable in [D-18] despite citation error. Geographic risk stretched from general yard advice [D-18] rather than map [D-13]; 'known susceptibility' is interpretive not direct from transcript; no major hallucinations, but minor unverifiable stretches.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured around the question's specified combination (exposure, duration, geo risk, prior history) and addresses the 'despite' clauses directly with no off-topic content."
