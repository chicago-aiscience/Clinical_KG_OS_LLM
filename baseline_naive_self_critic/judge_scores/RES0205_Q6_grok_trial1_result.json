  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the doctor's plan from [D-37], including the specific physical exam components (listening to heart and lungs, quick physical exam) and the multi-step process (consulting the supervising doctor, reviewing the discussion, returning to discuss next steps). It uses nearly identical phrasing and citations as the Gold Answer for core facts, with no contradictions or errors; minor differences are in wording (e.g., 'plan for the future' vs. 'where to go from here') but preserve factual accuracy.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: multi-step plan [D-37], physical exam specifics (heart/lungs auscultation and quick physical exam), collaborative process details (get supervising doctor, review everything talked about, return to discuss next steps). Missed: foreshadowing in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], note on no diagnosis/meds yet, and transcript ending context—these are supplementary rather than core plan elements, so ~90% coverage of substantive content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer directly verifiable in [D-37]: 'listen to heart and lungs' and 'quick physical exam'; 'go get the doctor...'; 'go over everything you talked about'; 'come back and talk...'. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; paraphrases are precise and citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is perfectly structured to address the question, with sections explicitly on 'Physical Examination Components' and 'Process for Determining Next Steps,' using transcript evidence without any off-topic content."
