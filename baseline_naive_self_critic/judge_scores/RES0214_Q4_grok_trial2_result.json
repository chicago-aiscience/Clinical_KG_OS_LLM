  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab test with accurate citation [D-53], consistent with Gold. However, it inaccurately attributes the prioritization rationale primarily to fever and sore throat symptoms generally requiring ruling out infectious causes, omitting and contradicting Gold's emphasis on the epidemiological context of household transmission from the husband [P-19, D-53]; it ignores self-isolation instructions and the explicit contrast with influenza as a secondary possibility after no flu shot.",
    "completeness": "Covered: diagnostic test (COVID swab [D-53]), statement that COVID is first to rule out [D-53]. Missed: household transmission pattern and husband's symptoms [P-19], full quote context 'if your husband got it, and you have it' [D-53], self-isolation instruction [D-53], urgency of containing infection [D-54], influenza as secondary possibility post flu shot inquiry [P-53, D-54]. Covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: COVID swab ordered [D-53], fever/sore throat presentation [multiple], quotes from [D-53] accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the diagnostic test; provides a rationale for prioritizing COVID-19 with citations, but does not explicitly address or contrast with influenza prioritization, slightly reducing focus on full question."
