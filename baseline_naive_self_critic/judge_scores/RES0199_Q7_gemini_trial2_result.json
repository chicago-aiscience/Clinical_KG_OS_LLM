  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the transcript and gold answer. It correctly identifies the initial symptoms (headache and cough 4 days ago), the onset of loss of smell (1 day ago), and the occurrence of GI symptoms. It correctly notes the persistent nature of the respiratory and neurological symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but lacks some of the finer details found in the gold answer. Specifically, it does not explicitly state that the severity of the headache and cough 'stayed around the same' as requested by the prompt (it uses 'persistent' instead). It also lumps the GI symptoms together as starting 'a few days after' rather than specifying the precise breakdown (diarrhea 2 days ago, vomiting yesterday) mentioned in the gold answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information in the generated answer is grounded in the transcript. The citations [P-1], [P-24], [P-12], and [P-3] are accurate and support the claims made.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the timeline, the order of symptom appearance, and the progression of the illness over the four-day period."
