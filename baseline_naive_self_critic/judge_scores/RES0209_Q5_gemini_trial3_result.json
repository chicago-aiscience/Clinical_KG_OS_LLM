  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three triggers and the family history. However, it incorrectly suggests cold air could be an allergen (it is a physical trigger) and implies goldfish might be a focus of the allergy suspicion, which is clinically unlikely and not supported by the gold answer. It also fails to include the specific quantitative evidence of exacerbation provided in the gold answer (the increase from once every two weeks to 5-6 times per week).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points found in the gold answer: 1) the specific frequency of inhaler use (P-8), which defines the exacerbation; 2) the doctor's specific verbal reaction and follow-up regarding the allergy suspicion (D-12, D-13, D-31); and 3) the clinician's concluding suggestion to change medications to improve control (D-43).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly faithful to the transcript but contains 'meta-hallucinations' by repeatedly referencing a 'Knowledge Graph' that was not provided in the prompt context. The facts retrieved (triggers, sister) are present in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question, structure-wise, and connects the elements of triggers, family history, and exacerbation/allergies as requested."
