  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Lipitor: Correctly identified as a current prescribed medication and linked to cholesterol management, consistent with the transcript/gold answer.\n- Tylenol: Correctly identified as an OTC medication the patient took and correctly reports the patient’s perceived benefit (“helps a little bit”).\n- Main factual error: The Generated Answer states Tylenol is used to relieve the symptom of cough. The transcript does not state this; the gold answer ties Tylenol use to feeling feverish/unwell (symptomatic relief), not specifically cough. This is a clinically meaningful mismatch in indication.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer:\n- Lipitor (atorvastatin) for high cholesterol: INCLUDED.\n- Patient confirmed Lipitor is the only prescribed medication: NOT INCLUDED.\n- Tylenol (acetaminophen) as OTC for symptom relief related to feeling feverish/unwell: PARTIALLY INCLUDED (OTC med and effect included; indication misstated as cough).\n- OTC effectiveness: INCLUDED (“helps a little bit”).\n- No other prescription/OTC meds mentioned: NOT INCLUDED.\n- Non-med measure (expectorating sputum helps temporarily): NOT INCLUDED (less central to the question, but present in gold answer).",
    "faithfulness": "- The statements that the patient takes Lipitor [P-26] and took Tylenol [P-14], and that Tylenol helped “a little bit” [P-14], are grounded in the transcript.\n- The claim that Tylenol relieves cough and the references to a “knowledge graph” relationship are not supported by the transcript and appear to be hallucinated/externally inferred.",
    "relevance": "- The answer is focused on current prescribed and OTC medications and includes the requested OTC effectiveness.\n- Minor issue: introducing an unsupported “knowledge graph” is unnecessary, but it does not substantially detract from addressing the question."
