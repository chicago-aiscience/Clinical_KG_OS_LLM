  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states that the patient had anxiety attacks as a teenager, discussed with her family doctor, and hasn’t seen a doctor for anxiety in ~8 years (consistent with [P-21]/[P-22]). It also correctly places chest pain onset at ~1.5 weeks ago with pleuritic quality and ~20-minute episodes and minimal response to OTC meds (consistent with [P-2],[P-3],[P-6]).\n\nHowever, it contains major factual errors relative to the Gold Answer/transcript:\n- It characterizes the current presentation as a “recurrence of chest pain symptoms” and says chest pain was previously associated with teenage anxiety attacks. This contradicts the patient explicitly stating she has never felt this pain before ([P-17]).\n- It misuses [P-20]: the patient describes heart flutter/skipped beats during prior anxiety attacks, not chest pain, and not “felt like that pain before.”\n- It omits/does not correctly describe the smoking timeline (start at ~18, escalation to ~10/day for last 2 years, then halving a few months ago) and instead gives only the current reduced amount.\n- It introduces “knowledge graph” causal links (e.g., anxiety attacks → chest pain) that are not stated in the transcript and overstates causality.\n\nOverall, the core timeline is partially right but with significant contradictions about whether chest pain is new vs recurrent and incorrect linking of symptoms to past anxiety.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: \n- Teenage anxiety attacks with family doctor and long gap since then (~8 years) (covered).\n- Recent academic stress and difficulty quitting smoking as contextual stressors (partially covered).\n- Chest pain onset ~1.5 weeks ago and never before (onset covered; “never before” contradicted).\n\nKey Gold Answer elements missed or insufficient:\n- Smoking began around age 18 (missing).\n- Smoking increased to ~10 cigarettes/day for the last two years (missing).\n- Cutting down began a few months ago and current ~5/day (partially present but timing/escalation missing).\n- Father’s heart attack last year/young-ish (50s) and resulting fear about cardiac disease (missing).\n- Stress specifically worsened over the “last couple of weeks” due to thesis time crunch (only generic busy school; misses the explicit “last couple of weeks/time crunch”).\n- Symptom pattern: more noticeable when alone/walking/studying and less when distracted/talking to others (missing).\n\nThis is well below 80% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript:\n- References to a “knowledge graph” and explicit edge claims (stress → chest pain; anxiety attacks → chest pain) are not present in the transcript.\n- Claim that chest pain was previously associated with teenage anxiety attacks is not supported and conflicts with [P-17].\n- The interpretation that symptoms are a “recurrence of chest pain” is directly contradicted by the transcript.\n\nSome parts are faithful (timing and description of chest pain, teen anxiety history, current smoking reduction), but the answer includes several hallucinated/overstated causal assertions and a key contradiction.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely aimed at tracing a timeline (smoking/anxiety/stress/chest pain) and describing how phases relate, which matches the question. It includes some unnecessary “knowledge graph” framing, but it stays mostly on-topic. Despite relevance, inaccuracies weaken its usefulness."

  "summary": "The answer is on-topic and captures some timing details, but it omits major timeline elements (smoking trajectory, father’s MI, specific recent stress escalation) and makes key unfaithful/incorrect claims that chest pain is recurrent and previously tied to teen anxiety despite the patient stating it is new."
