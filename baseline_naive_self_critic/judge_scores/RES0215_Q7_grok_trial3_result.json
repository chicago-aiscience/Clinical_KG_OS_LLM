  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the onset (4-5 days ago), initial trigger (playing tag, out of breath), early symptoms (wheezy, SOB), and recent emergence of slight cough. However, it inaccurately attributes the fluctuating pattern to past viral infections over two years [P-15] rather than current activity/rest cycles [P-5,P-6]; introduces colder weather [P-38] and seasonal allergies [P-35] not central to Gold's progression; hallucinates a 'knowledge graph'; and falsely claims no nocturnal episode despite clear transcript evidence [P-43,P-44], directly contradicting Gold and question. Misses details like difficulty with deep breaths [P-2], non-productive cough [P-31], and pertinent negatives (no cyanosis [P-32], no fever [P-7]). Significant errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: onset [P-1] (✓), trigger playing tag/out of breath [P-3] (✓), fluctuating/episodic pattern [P-5,P-6] (partially, wrong explanation), cough emergence/recent [P-1] (✓). Missed: precise early symptoms (wheezy + difficulty deep breaths [P-2]), exact fluctuating details (resolves own, recurs with activity, resolves with rest [P-6]), cough non-productive [P-31], single nocturnal wheeziness/trouble falling asleep [P-43,P-44], negatives (no cyanosis [P-32], no fever [P-7], fine otherwise [P-9]). Covers ~40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: onset/trigger [P-1,P-3], cough [P-1], cold weather [P-38], allergies [P-35]. Unverifiable/hallucinated: repeated 'knowledge graph' references (absent from transcript); links past viral infections [P-15] to current fluctuating pattern (not supported); falsely states 'transcript does not contain info' on nocturnal episode despite explicit [P-43,P-44]. Multiple hallucinations and misrepresentations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around question elements (onset/trigger, fluctuating pattern, cough emergence, nocturnal episode), using bold headings matching query; minor tangents include past virals, allergies, cold weather, and knowledge graph, but core focus on symptom progression is maintained."
