  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the medication taken at home and headache as the target symptom, which matches the Gold Answer. The supportive measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep) and medication recommendations (antipyretics, NSAIDs) are all accurately captured from [D-52]. The mention of COVID-19 testing and 14-day isolation from the Gold Answer is missing, but the core factual content about medications and management is correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but omits two elements present in the Gold Answer: (1) the patient's self-initiated hydration efforts mentioned in [P-30], and (2) the COVID-19 swab test and 14-day isolation instruction. These represent approximately 20-25% of the total key information in the Gold Answer. The answer captures 75-80% of the essential content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations to [P-3], [P-1], and [D-52] are accurate. The knowledge graph reference about tylenol being taken for headache is consistent with the transcript. No hallucinated information is present. The answer stays grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question: (1) medication taken at home (Tylenol), (2) symptom targeted (headache), and (3) doctor's recommended management plan (supportive measures and medications). The answer is well-focused with clear section headings and no irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-structured response that correctly identifies Tylenol for headache relief and comprehensively details the doctor's supportive management plan. All information is properly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer loses minor points for completeness due to omitting the patient's self-initiated hydration efforts and the COVID-19 testing/isolation instructions, which represent about 20% of the Gold Answer's key points. Otherwise, it demonstrates strong correctness, faithfulness, and relevance."
