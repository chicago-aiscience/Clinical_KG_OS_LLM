  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally incorrect. It claims the transcript only contains patient responses and lacks clinician dialogue, which is false. The source transcript includes 44 turns, many of which belong to the clinician (D-1 to D-44). Consequently, it fails to identify the COVID swab, the medication change suggestion, or the consultation with the supervising physician, all of which are clearly stated in the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 100% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not mention the COVID-19 swab, the intention to change the medication regimen, or the plan to consult the supervising doctor.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits severe hallucination by claiming the source text is incomplete. It also incorrectly interprets the mention of goldfish as a trigger, whereas the transcript only mentions them as pets. It fails to ground itself in the provided text, despite the text containing all the necessary information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question. Instead of answering the prompt using the provided data, it provides a meta-commentary claiming the data is missing, which is factually wrong."
