  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the only reported medication use is occasional OTC antihistamines (Reactine/“over the counter stuff”) for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications in her management (consistent with P-36, P-46, P-47). It does not introduce any incorrect specific medications or treatments. Minor issues: it attributes statements to “the patient” rather than the mother, and it references a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript evidence.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered: (1) occasional OTC Reactine/OTC allergy meds; (2) no prescribed medications. Key points missed: (1) for the current wheezing/SOB episodes, the mother does not give her anything and episodes resolve on their own with rest (P-33/P-34); (2) prior infections did not require antibiotics (P-16) (less central but included in Gold Answer). Overall, it captures the main medication list but omits important context about no treatment for the respiratory episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (P-36 for Reactine/OTC meds and ‘no prescribed medications’). However, the mention of “knowledge graph information” and that these treatments are ‘associated with her medical history’ per KG is not verifiable from the provided transcript and constitutes an ungrounded addition, though it does not materially change the medication list.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments and whether prescribed medication is part of management. It is relevant to the question, though it incompletely addresses treatment for the current respiratory episodes."
