  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition as cardiac ischemia. It accurately notes the lack of pain as a primary factor. However, it claims this 'rules out' the condition based on a knowledge graph, while the source transcript and Gold Answer more accurately state it is simply 'lower on the differential.'",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer. Specifically, it omits the absence of anxiety, sweating, and 'impending doom' (P-6). It also misses the doctor's observation that the patient 'didn't really get out of breath with exercise' (D-36), which the Gold Answer highlights as a reason for deprioritizing the condition.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer references a 'knowledge graph' which is not included in the provided source transcript, suggesting a minor hallucination or reliance on external context. However, its citations of the transcript (P-1, P-5, P-7, D-36) are accurate and the core findings align with the text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both the condition and the symptoms requested by the question."
