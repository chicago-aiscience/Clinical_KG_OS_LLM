  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript regarding the diagnostic swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, supportive care elements (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches), and mention of alternative viral illness. Minor discrepancy: omits the specific 24-48 hour results timeframe mentioned in Gold/transcript. Extraneous 'Knowledge Graph' references are not factual errors against Gold but are unnecessary additions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnostic swab (partial, misses timeframe), 14-day isolation (full), contact tracing if positive (full), alternative viral illness (full), all supportive care items (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fevers, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches - full). Missed: explicit '24-48 hours' results time and 'no prescription medications beyond supportive'. Covers ~90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All core claims (swab, isolation, tracing, supportive care) directly verifiable in [D-52] with accurate citations. 'Knowledge Graph' references and procedural labels (e.g., '[PROCEDURE] covid') are unverifiable in transcript and appear hallucinated/external, but minor and do not alter main content.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question on the doctor's management plan, structuring response around specified elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care) with no off-topic content beyond minor annotations."
