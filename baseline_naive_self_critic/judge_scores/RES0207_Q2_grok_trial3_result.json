  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication prescribed [P-23], consistent with the Gold Answer. It accurately quotes the patient's statement about forgetting the med [P-9], which aligns with the Gold's reference to this. However, it does not specify the chronic condition (epilepsy) or the detailed circumstance (daughter's birthday celebration, altered dinner routine [P-24]), representing minor discrepancies in depth but no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 1) Keppra for epilepsy [P-23, P-8] - medication covered, condition not mentioned; 2) forgetting med [P-9] - covered; 3) specific circumstance: daughter's birthday, usually takes with dinner, early celebration, no later dinner, forgot [P-24] - not covered; 4) doctor's acknowledgment of common lapse [D-25] - not covered; 5) isolated lapse [D-24, P-24] - not covered; 6) link to seizure [P-9] - implied but not explicit. Covers medication and basic forgetting (~20-49% of key points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable: Keppra cited from [P-23] accurately; exact quote from [P-9] with correct citation. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded in transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured with bullet points directly addressing the two parts of the question (medication and circumstance), with no off-topic content or tangents; perfectly focused."
