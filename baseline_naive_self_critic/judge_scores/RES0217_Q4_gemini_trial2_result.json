  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is largely correct in its identification of the bullseye rash, joint pain, and fever/systemic illness as absent features. However, it misses the assessment for headaches (D-19) which was a specific clinical feature mentioned in both the transcript and the gold answer. It also attributes the lack of fever/illness to the patient's mention of cholesterol (P-14) instead of the direct denial of fever in P-8. The diagnostic tests (physical exam, tick ID, blood work) are accurately identified.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers approximately 60-70% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the main clinical features (rash, joint pain, fever) and the proposed tests (exam, tick ID, blood work). However, it misses several specific details: the assessment for headaches, the confirmation that there were no other bites, and the plan to consult with a supervising physician before finalization.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is generally faithful to the transcript. There is a slight logical leap where the model uses the patient's comment about cholesterol (P-14) to justify the absence of fever, whereas the transcript contains a direct denial of fever (P-8). The rest of the citations and claims are grounded in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question: the clinical features assessed/absent and the diagnostic tests proposed."
