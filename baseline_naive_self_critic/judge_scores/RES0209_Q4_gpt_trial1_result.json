  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer states the clinician screened for infectious symptoms/exposures (recent cold/infection, sick contacts in/outside home, travel, loss of taste/smell, fever, N/V, belly pain; and confirmed nonproductive cough) and planned a COVID swab despite negative responses. The Generated Answer instead focuses on non-infectious asthma triggers (cold air, pollen, pets, exercise) and wheezing/bronchodilator response, and incorrectly states the planned “diagnostic test” was increased bronchodilator usage (which is not a test). It omits the planned COVID swab and misidentifies what was screened for to rule out infection. Therefore, it is largely factually inconsistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements missing: (1) asked about recent colds/infections and denial; (2) asked about sick contacts at home and denial; (3) asked about sick contacts outside home and denial; (4) asked about travel and denial; (5) asked about loss of taste/smell and denial; (6) asked about fever and denial; (7) asked about nausea/vomiting and denial; (8) asked about belly pain and denial; (9) explanation that these can happen with infection/after infection; (10) plan to do COVID swab despite negative screening. The Generated Answer covers essentially none of these infectious-rule-out items and instead discusses asthma triggers not asked for in the question. Completeness is therefore very low.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple claims are either irrelevant to the question or not supported as infectious screening (e.g., “doctor likely screened…to distinguish from infection” regarding cold air/pollen/pets/exercise). It also introduces “knowledge graph” content not present in the transcript and asserts an “implied negative screening for infection not captured,” which is incorrect because infection screening *is* captured. The statement that the planned item was “increased usage of bronchodilator” is unsupported and contradicts the transcript, where the planned test was a COVID swab. Overall, the answer is poorly grounded in the transcript and contains hallucinated framing and an incorrect ‘test.’",
    "relevance": "The question asks specifically about infectious/COVID symptom and exposure screening and the planned diagnostic test. The Generated Answer largely discusses asthma triggers and management, not infectious screening, and mislabels treatment as a diagnostic test. Thus it only minimally addresses the asked topic."
