  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition to rule out as COVID-19, the ordered test as a COVID swab, and the prompting contact detail as walking with a friend who had been sick and sometimes being too close outdoors. These align with the Gold Answer and the cited transcript lines (D-43, P-20). No substantive factual contradictions are present.",
    "completeness": "It includes the core elements: COVID-19, COVID swab, and sick-contact exposure with close proximity outdoors. It omits a supporting Gold Answer detail that the doctor specifically asked whether the sick friend had a COVID test and the patient was unsure (D-21/P-21). It also omits other screening context (smell/taste, travel, etc.), though those are not strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The main claims are grounded in the transcript and appropriately cited. However, the phrase \"risk factor of exposure cited in the knowledge graph\" is not supported by the transcript and appears to be extraneous/unverifiable, lowering faithfulness slightly.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers the question (condition, test, and the social-contact detail that prompted consideration) with minimal tangential content."
