{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains a significant factual error: it states the patient 'maintained their daily walking routine,' whereas the transcript [P-22] and gold answer clarify that the patient reduced his activity from two walks a day to just one. It also fails to mention the core fact that symptoms have been 'staying the same' over the three days, which was a specific requirement of the question.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer: 1) It does not explicitly state the patient was walking his dog when symptoms first appeared. 2) it misses the 'staying the same' progression status. 3) It omits 'getting up out of a chair' and 'big breath in' as exacerbating factors. 4) It misses the detail that no work was missed. It only successfully covers the 3-day onset and 'walking' as a trigger.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the patient 'maintained their daily walking routine' is unfaithful to the transcript [P-22], which states the patient has been limiting his walks. The rest of the information is generally grounded, though the 'Evolution' section focuses on secondary symptoms (phlegm/hoarseness) not emphasized in the gold answer's description of tightness evolution.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the general topics of the question but fails to provide the specific details requested (better/worse/same, specific triggers, and the actual change in the walking routine). It adds some clinical speculation about asthma/cardiac ischemia which, while in the transcript, wasn't specifically asked for in the context of symptom evolution."
