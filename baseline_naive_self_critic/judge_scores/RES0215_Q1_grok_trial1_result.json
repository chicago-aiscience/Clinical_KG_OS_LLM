  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the main respiratory symptoms reported at presentation (wheezy, shortness of breath, slight cough, difficulty taking deep breaths) matching Gold's core symptoms from [P-1] and [P-2]. However, it incorrectly identifies only 'wheezy' as the earliest symptom based on [P-1], whereas Gold Answer correctly notes both wheezing AND difficulty taking deep breaths as earliest per direct response to [D-2] in [P-2]. It also omits details like activity-related out-of-breath [P-3], hard time catching breath/no cyanosis [P-32], non-productive cough [P-31], and 'looks fine' [P-9], introducing some discrepancies on the 'earliest' specifics.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: wheezy [P-1], short of breath [P-1], slight cough (recent) [P-1], difficulty deep breaths [P-2]. Missed or incomplete: out-of-breath with activity [P-3], hard time catching breath/no cyanosis [P-32], both as earliest explicitly [P-2], non-productive cough [P-31], looks fine otherwise [P-9]. Covers ~60% of Gold's detailed key points, focusing on primary symptoms but lacking fuller description and precise earliest pairing.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: wheezy/short of breath/cough [P-1], difficulty deep breaths [P-2]. Reasoning for earliest uses [P-1] phrasing (valid though not the most direct), no fabricated facts or inaccurate citations; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing specific symptoms at presentation with evidence and identifying earliest symptom(s), structured clearly with no off-topic content or tangents."
