  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer significantly misinterprets the question and Gold Answer. The question asks about symptoms and exposures the patient DENIED, but the Generated Answer focuses on symptoms the patient CONFIRMED (shortness of breath, cough). The Gold Answer correctly identifies denied symptoms like chest pain, feeling faint, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, diarrhea, loss of taste/smell, sore throat, runny nose, sick contacts, and travel. The Generated Answer also incorrectly characterizes the seizure discussion as a 'denial' when the patient actually confirmed having a seizure. Major factual errors throughout.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the vast majority of denied symptoms (chest pain, feeling faint, GI symptoms, upper respiratory symptoms) and exposures (sick contacts, travel). It does not address the systematic screening approach across cardiac, infectious, and gastrointestinal categories. The Generated Answer only briefly mentions cardiac and infectious differentials without the detailed symptom mapping provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains factual claims verifiable in the transcript but severely misrepresents them. The claim that the patient 'denied the relationship between the seizure and respiratory symptoms' is misleading - the patient said 'I don't know if that's related' which is uncertainty, not denial. The main issue is the answer addresses the wrong question entirely (confirmed vs denied symptoms), though the cited exchanges [D-2], [P-1], [P-4], [P-8], [P-9] do exist in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely off-topic because it focuses on symptoms the patient CONFIRMED rather than those DENIED, which is the core of the question. While it briefly mentions differential diagnoses (cardiac, infectious), it fails to connect these to the pattern of negative findings. The answer does not address gastrointestinal differentials at all, nor does it explain how the denied symptoms help narrow the differential diagnosis."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misunderstands the question by focusing on confirmed symptoms rather than denied ones. It omits the vast majority of denied symptoms and exposures detailed in the Gold Answer (chest pain, GI symptoms, upper respiratory symptoms, sick contacts, travel). The answer contains factual errors in interpretation (characterizing uncertainty as denial) and fails to adequately address how negative findings inform differential diagnoses. Only 2 of 4 dimensions scored above 1 due to some faithfulness to transcript content and minimal relevance to differential diagnosis concepts, but overall the response does not address the question asked."
