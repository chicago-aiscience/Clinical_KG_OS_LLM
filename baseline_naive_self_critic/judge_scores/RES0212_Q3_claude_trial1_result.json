  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies the primary diagnosis as 'Bacterial Pneumonia' or 'Acute Bacterial Bronchitis' with high confidence, while the Gold Answer more appropriately describes 'acute lower respiratory tract infection, most likely acute bronchitis with possible bacterial superinfection or early community-acquired pneumonia.' The Generated Answer also fabricates or misinterprets evidence - it claims subjective fevers were not mentioned when they were explicitly stated in P-4 ('hot at night'), and incorrectly substitutes fatigue/malaise for the actual fever symptom. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' that doesn't exist in the source material. The core facts are partially correct but the diagnosis is stated with inappropriate certainty and key evidence is misrepresented.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses the three required elements (productive cough, sputum color, fever) but incompletely. It correctly identifies the productive cough and greenish sputum with appropriate citations. However, it completely misses the actual subjective fever mentioned in P-4 ('feeling hot at night') and instead substitutes fatigue/sleep disturbance as evidence of systemic inflammation. It also omits important contextual details from the Gold Answer: the three-month history of intermittent cough, the acute three-day worsening, the absence of constitutional symptoms (no night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis), and the diagnostic uncertainty that distinguishes acute infection from chronic conditions. Coverage is approximately 50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple problematic claims. It references a 'Knowledge Graph' that does not exist in the transcript. Most significantly, it claims 'the transcript does not explicitly mention fevers' when P-4 clearly states 'I've been feeling like hot at night in the past couple days.' It then attempts to substitute fatigue and sleep disturbance as evidence of fever/systemic inflammation, which is a misrepresentation. The citations for productive cough [P-1, P-3, P-19] and greenish sputum [P-9] are accurate, but the fabrication of the 'Knowledge Graph' and the complete misrepresentation of the fever symptom constitute significant hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by identifying a diagnosis and explaining how each of the three clinical features contributes as evidence. The structure follows the question's requirements. However, it includes some tangential content (the Knowledge Graph references, the note about 'yellow sputum' vs 'greenish') and misses the diagnostic nuance emphasized in the Gold Answer regarding the distinction between acute and chronic conditions. The answer is mostly focused but includes unnecessary fabricated elements and lacks the clinical reasoning depth shown in the Gold Answer."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question but contains significant errors. Most critically, it completely misses the subjective fevers explicitly mentioned in P-4, substituting fatigue instead, which represents a major factual error. It also fabricates references to a 'Knowledge Graph' not present in the source material, constituting hallucination. The diagnosis is stated with inappropriate certainty compared to the more nuanced Gold Answer. While it correctly identifies and cites the productive cough and greenish sputum, it omits important contextual information about the three-month history, acute worsening, and absence of constitutional symptoms. The answer is partially relevant and covers some key points but falls short on correctness and faithfulness due to the fever misrepresentation and fabricated sources."
