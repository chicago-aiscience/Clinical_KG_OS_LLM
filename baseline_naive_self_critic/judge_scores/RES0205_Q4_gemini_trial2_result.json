  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID-19) and the test used. However, it fails significantly on the timing of the test, stating it is not explicitly detailed in the transcript. In reality, the patient clearly states in [P-36] that the test was done 'when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.' It also mentions 'exclusionary documentation' which is not mentioned in the text.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the specific timing details requested by the question (at symptom onset/two weeks ago). It also omits several workplace-related nuances mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as the patient's consistent use of PPE and their specific desire to return to work once the cough subsides.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a negative hallucination (claiming information is missing when it is present in [P-36]) and an inferential hallucination regarding 'exclusionary documentation' which is not supported by the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is well-structured and directly addresses all four parts of the question, even if some of the information provided is incorrect or incomplete."
