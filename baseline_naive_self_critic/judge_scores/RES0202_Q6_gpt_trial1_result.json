  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript/gold answer on the key factual elements: COVID swab ordered with 24–48h turnaround [D-44], symptoms consistent with COVID/infection [D-44, D-45], 14-day isolation including separation from younger sister [D-44], acknowledgement of possible false negatives [D-44], alternative explanation of another circulating viral illness if negative [D-44], and ER return precautions (high temperature, neurologic symptoms e.g., seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting) [D-44]. Minor wording differences (e.g., “strict” isolation; omits “if possible” re sister) do not materially change meaning.",
    "completeness": "Covers most gold-answer key points: test + turnaround, isolation duration, false negatives, alternative viral illness, and specific ER warning signs with an example (seizures). However, it omits the additional differential note that asthma would be considered if cough/shortness of breath occurred without fever [D-45], and it does not explicitly mention the watchful-waiting/no-medications aspect of the plan (present in the gold summary).",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by [D-44] and [D-45]. The mention of a “knowledge graph” is extraneous and not in the transcript, but it does not introduce new clinical claims. No major hallucinated clinical details.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the requested components (assessment/plan, test and turnaround, isolation, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negatives, and ER warning signs with examples). The only relevance gap is the missing asthma differential note that is part of the doctor’s complete assessment/plan."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly accurate, faithful, and relevant, but slightly incomplete because it omits the doctor’s added note about considering asthma (if no fever) and does not explicitly state the watchful-waiting/no-medication plan."
