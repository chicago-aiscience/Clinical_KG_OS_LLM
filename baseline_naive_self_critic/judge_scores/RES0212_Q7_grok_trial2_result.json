  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states the cough has been present for 'maybe for like a month' citing [P-19], but [P-2] and [P-13] clearly indicate a 3-month history with recent worsening; it fails to note the intermittent dry nature for the first 2 months, specifies no timeline for productivity (Gold has 3 days [P-12]), vaguely covers sleep disruption without the 1-month timeline [P-21], and erroneously claims no subjective fevers despite [P-4] explicitly mentioning feeling hot at night for a couple days, leading to significant factual contradictions with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: 3-month onset [P-2,P-13], intermittent dry for ~2 months [P-2], 1-month sleep disruption [P-19,P-21], 3-day productive green sputum [P-2,P-9,P-12], couple days subjective fevers [P-4], acute-on-chronic summary [D-47]; Generated covers green sputum color partially and vague sleep disruption, missing onset timeline, intermittency, precise sleep start, productive onset, fevers entirely, and progression — covers ~20-30% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: bothering cough [P-1], green sputum [P-9], some sleep waking [P-19]; unverifiable/misrepresented: 'cough ... for maybe ... a month' misattributes [P-19] (refers to sleep issue duration, not total cough per [P-2,P-13]); hallucinates absence of fevers despite [P-4] 'feeling like hot at night in the past couple days'; mentions non-existent 'knowledge graph'; multiple misinterpretations and denials of transcript content.",
    "relevance": "The answer structures a timeline directly mirroring the question's elements (onset, sleep, productivity, fevers), with section headers matching, no off-topic content, though incomplete and erroneous — highly focused on the query."
