  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors relative to the Gold Answer/transcript. Most notably, it incorrectly states the cough has been bothering her for “approximately one month” and cites [P-1], whereas the patient reports an intermittent cough for ~3 months [P-2] with nocturnal awakening mainly over the last month [P-21]. It omits/gets wrong key cough characteristics (initially dry/intermittent; became productive over ~3 days). It also fails to accurately report sputum details (no blood [P-10], no foul smell noticed [P-11]) and associated symptom of feeling hot at night (subjective fever) [P-4]. The denials section does not correctly name the symptoms denied and therefore does not meet the question’s requirement.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: greenish sputum color; chest discomfort only with coughing; fatigue and sleep disruption. Key points missed: 3-month duration and intermittent nature; initial dry cough; change to productive cough in last ~3 days; description of “gunk/really gross”; explicit denial of hemoptysis; no foul smell noticed; subjective fever/feeling hot at night; cough waking her nightly for ~1 month; exercise limitation; explicit denials of night sweats, weight loss/loose clothes, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, body pain/tenderness; denial of sick contacts (class/around her/roommate). Overall, it covers well under half of the Gold Answer elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not supported or are mis-cited by the transcript, especially the “approximately one month [P-1]” cough duration (hallucinated/misattributed). Other included items (green sputum, pain when coughing, tiredness, sleep disturbance) are grounded in [P-3], [P-9], [P-19]/[P-21]. However, the answer introduces “knowledge graph” language not present in the transcript and fails to accurately extract and label denials, reducing groundedness.",
    "relevance": "It attempts to answer the question by listing symptoms and denials, but the denials are not specified (it only references [P-5] and [P-6] without naming what was denied), and major requested respiratory characteristics (cough timeline, sputum onset/amount/other features, explicit denials) are missing. Thus it is only partially responsive."

  "summary": "The response is partially grounded and mentions a few correct symptoms, but it has a major error about cough duration and is substantially incomplete—especially regarding sputum characteristics and the specific symptoms the patient explicitly denied."
