  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the reasoning for the 72-hour attachment duration based on the patient's activity on Friday and Saturday. However, it incorrectly states that the transcript does not contain information about the Lyme disease distribution map or the geographic justification for Strathroy. Segment [D-13] in the transcript explicitly mentions both the map and Strathroy's status as a 'concerning point.'",
    "completeness": "The answer only covers the first half of the question. It fails to provide any details regarding the geographic risk assessment, which is a key component of the Gold Answer and the original question, due to an incorrect claim that the information was missing.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a significant negative hallucination. It claims the doctor does not discuss the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, whereas the transcript clearly shows the doctor doing exactly that in segment [D-13].",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant. While it addresses the first part of the prompt regarding the timeline, it fails to address the second part because of a false premise regarding the content of the transcript."
