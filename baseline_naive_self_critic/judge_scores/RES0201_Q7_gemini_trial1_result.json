  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the sore throat starting four days ago and the breathing difficulty starting yesterday. However, it fails to accurately place the muscle aches and loss of taste in the timeline. The transcript explicitly states muscle aches started 'immediately after' the sore throat [P-26] and loss of taste started 'two days ago' [P-20]. The generated answer groups these under 'Current Status' without their specific onset times. It also hesitates on identifying the symptom starting yesterday, whereas the Gold Answer and transcript clearly link it to breathing difficulty.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key chronological details found in the Gold Answer: the specific 'two days ago' onset for loss of taste, the 'immediately after' onset for muscle aches/fatigue, and the mention of failed self-treatments (salt-water/painkillers).",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is grounded in the transcript and does not hallucinate new symptoms. However, it claims the transcript is vague about which symptom started yesterday ('the transcript specifies only that \"that\" started yesterday'), which is slightly inaccurate as the dialogue flow [D-7 to P-8] clearly identifies it as breathing difficulty.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the prompt's request for chronological order and severity, although the timeline is less precise than the Gold Answer due to the missing timestamps for aches and taste loss."
