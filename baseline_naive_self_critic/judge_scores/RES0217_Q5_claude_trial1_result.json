    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the timeline (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday) and the doctor's calculation of >72 hours attachment duration. However, it contains a significant factual error by stating that the transcript does NOT contain evidence of the doctor discussing the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, when in fact the doctor explicitly references it in [D-13]: 'I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point.' This is a major factual error that directly contradicts the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the key points. It addresses the timeline and attachment duration calculation but completely fails to acknowledge the geographic risk justification using the distribution map, which is a critical component of the question. The Gold Answer includes both elements: (1) the attachment duration reasoning and (2) the geographic risk justification via the distribution map. The Generated Answer only partially covers the first element and explicitly denies the second.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant hallucination or misrepresentation. It explicitly states that the transcript 'do not contain evidence' of the doctor discussing the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, when [D-13] clearly shows the doctor referencing this map and using it to assess Strathroy's risk level. This represents a failure to accurately reflect what is verifiable in the transcript, despite correctly citing other portions.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is only partially relevant. It addresses one part of the two-part question (attachment duration) but then explicitly denies the existence of information that directly answers the second part (geographic justification via map). The answer is structured to address both parts of the question but fails to do so accurately, making it only partially relevant to the full scope of what was asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question by correctly identifying the timeline (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday) and the doctor's calculation of >72 hours attachment duration. However, it contains a critical factual error by explicitly denying that the transcript contains evidence of the doctor discussing the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, when [D-13] clearly shows the doctor referencing this map and using Strathroy's position on it to justify concern and prophylactic treatment. This represents both a failure in completeness (missing 50% of required content) and faithfulness (misrepresenting what is verifiable in the transcript). The answer only partially addresses the two-part question, covering the attachment duration but failing to acknowledge the geographic risk justification that was explicitly requested."
