  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all key facts from the Gold Answer. Both identify the working diagnosis as 'most likely a viral infection like the common cold,' list the same supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold/over-the-counter medications), describe the COVID swab test with 48-hour results, and include the isolation instruction with follow-up from public health. The Generated Answer adds context about ruling out COVID-19, which is consistent with the transcript but not explicitly stated in the Gold Answer. No contradictions or factual errors exist.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components from the Gold Answer: (1) stated diagnosis, (2) both supportive care recommendations (hydration and OTC medications), (3) diagnostic test details (COVID swab, timing, results timeframe), and (4) public health guidance (isolation and follow-up instructions). The Gold Answer mentions that symptoms 'can take a few weeks to fully resolve' and there is 'not much beyond supportive care available,' which the Generated Answer omits. However, all essential management plan elements are present.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in [D-39]. The diagnosis statement, hydration advice, Tylenol Cold recommendation, COVID swab ordering, 48-hour result timeframe, isolation instruction, and public health follow-up are all accurately quoted or paraphrased from the source material. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question, which asks for the complete management plan including diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance. All content is highly relevant and organized according to the question's structure. No off-topic or tangential information is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent response that is factually accurate, well-grounded in the transcript, and highly relevant to the question. It covers all major components of the management plan with proper citations. The only minor gap is the omission of timeline expectations for symptom resolution and the acknowledgment that limited treatment exists beyond supportive care, which slightly affects completeness but does not undermine the overall quality of the response."
