  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the ruled-out condition, the COVID test used, and the workplace concerns. However, it states the timing is 'not explicitly detailed' when the patient clearly states in [P-36] that 'I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.' This is a factual error regarding timing specificity.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the main required elements: condition (COVID-19), test type (COVID test), workplace concerns (coworkers scared, hospital environment). However, it misses important details present in the Gold Answer: the test was specifically at symptom onset (not vague), the patient has been home since testing, wants to return but not while coughing, wears PPE at work, and the desire for medication is partly driven by workplace return needs. Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is largely grounded in the transcript with accurate citations [P-2], [P-34], [P-35]. However, it incorrectly claims the timing is 'not explicitly detailed' when [P-36] explicitly states 'I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago.' This represents a failure to accurately represent available transcript information, though not hallucination per se.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all four components of the question: condition ruled out, test used, timing, and workplace concerns. All content is relevant to answering the specific question asked, with no tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key elements (COVID-19, COVID test, workplace concerns at hospital with scared coworkers) but contains a significant error by stating the test timing is 'not explicitly detailed' when [P-36] clearly provides this information ('when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago'). The answer also omits several important contextual details present in the Gold Answer, including the patient staying home since testing, PPE usage, desire to return without coughing, and medication request motivation. While relevant and mostly accurate, the timing error and incomplete coverage of key points reduce its quality."
