  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains significant factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. Most importantly, it claims the patient 'maintained their daily walking routine,' whereas the transcript (P-22) states he reduced his walks from two per day to one. It also describes an 'evolution' and 'progression' of symptoms, while the patient explicitly stated symptoms were 'staying the same' and 'pretty steady' (P-2, P-3).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention that the symptoms have stayed the same/remained steady, it misses 'getting up out of a chair' and 'taking a big breath' as specific exacerbating factors, and it omits the detail that he first noticed the symptoms specifically while walking his dog (it only mentions walking as a general trigger later).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer hallucinates that the patient maintained his routine. It also misinterprets the patient's description of his condition as 'progressing' and 'evolving' when the transcript confirms the symptoms were stable over the three days. The connection of hoarseness as an 'evolution' of the chest tightness is also not supported by the transcript's timeline.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant in structure, directly addressing each component of the multi-part question (onset, evolution, triggers, and impact on routine). However, the content provided within those sections is inaccurate."
