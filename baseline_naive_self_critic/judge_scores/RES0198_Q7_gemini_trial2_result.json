{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the core facts regarding the onset (one week ago), the first symptom (stuffy nose), and the shift in predominance (to runny nose). However, it incorrectly identifies the frequency as 'intermittent' based on P-1, while ignoring the patient's explicit clarification in P-8 where they state the symptoms have been 'pretty constant' for the past week. By stating it was intermittent 'rather than constant,' it contradicts the later part of the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses a few key nuances found in the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention that the patient clarified the symptoms were 'constant' later in the interview. 2) It misses the mention of over-the-counter decongestants and their possible role in the symptom shift [P-10]. 3) It omits the fact that the symptoms were not improving, which prompted the visit.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is faithful to the transcript in that it uses direct quotes and correct citations for the points it includes. It does not hallucinate information outside the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question, providing a chronological progression, identifying the first symptom, the change in predominance, and the frequency."
