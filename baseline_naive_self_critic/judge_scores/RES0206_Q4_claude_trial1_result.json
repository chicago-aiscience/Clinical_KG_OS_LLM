  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the covid swab as the test ordered, and accurately describes the social contact detail (meeting friends to walk dogs, one friend being sick, walking too close despite being outdoors). All facts align with the Gold Answer and source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three required elements of the question (condition, test, social contact detail). However, it omits several relevant details present in the Gold Answer: the doctor's follow-up question about whether the friend got tested (which the patient didn't know), the screening for COVID-specific symptoms (loss of smell/taste, confusion, muscle aches - all denied), and the travel history question. These contextual details add clinical depth but the core answer is complete.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [D-43], [P-20]. The answer does not introduce any hallucinated information and appropriately references specific exchanges between doctor and patient.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three components of the question with focused, pertinent information. The structure clearly delineates each required element (condition, test, social contact detail) without tangential content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately and faithfully addresses all three components of the question with appropriate citations from the transcript. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the covid swab as the ordered test, and the relevant social contact detail (sick friend during outdoor dog walks with close proximity). While it omits some contextual details present in the Gold Answer (follow-up questions about the friend's testing, COVID symptom screening, travel history), it fully answers the core question with perfect factual accuracy and grounding in the source material."
