  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has significant factual errors: it does not trace smoking starting at age 18 as the first point per question and Gold, instead starting with teenage anxiety; incompletely covers smoking history (misses escalation to 10/day for 2 years and cut a few months ago); omits father's heart attack; misstates chest pain as a 'recurrence' previously associated with teenage anxiety (contradicts P-17 'never had this pain before' and P-20 only mentions heart flutter, not chest pain); vaguely covers recent stress without specifying 'last couple of weeks' thesis time crunch. Core idea of stress/anxiety link is present but distorted.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: teenage anxiety ~8 years ago (partial), current smoking reduction, general school stress/quitting difficulty, chest pain onset 1.5 weeks ago. Missed: smoking onset at 18, 8-year anxiety gap, 2-year smoking peak, few months ago reduction, father's heart attack, specific recent weeks thesis stress escalation, symptom newness, patterns when alone/distracted. Covers ~50-60% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly grounded (e.g., anxiety [P-21], smoking [P-14], stress [P-13], chest pain [P-1,3,6]); but hallucinates 'knowledge graph' and linkages like [PAST_CONDITION] anxiety --> chest pain (no KG in transcript); falsely claims prior chest pain association with anxiety [P-20/21] (P-20 is palpitations, P-17 denies prior pain); 'biological trigger' unverified. Multiple hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly attempts timeline of history (anxiety -> stress -> chest pain) with relations via stress/anxiety recurrence, addressing question core; minor off-topic via fabricated KG and inaccurate prior symptom link."
