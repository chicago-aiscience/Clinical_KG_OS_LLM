{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the patient only takes multivitamins [P-40], reports a penicillin allergy [P-37], and experiences a rash as the reaction [P-38]. These align with the Gold Answer and the transcript. No incorrect clinical facts are introduced.",
    "completeness": "For the question asked (current medication regimen, drug allergy, and specific adverse reaction), the Generated Answer includes all required elements: multivitamins only, penicillin allergy, rash. It does not mention the additional Gold Answer detail that she has no trouble breathing [P-39], but that detail is not required by the question prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All clinically relevant claims (meds, allergy, rash) are directly supported by the transcript. The parenthetical reference to a “knowledge graph” confirmation is not part of the transcript and is unverifiable from the provided source, but it does not add new clinical content beyond what is already supported.",
    "relevance": "The answer is tightly focused on the three requested items (medications, allergy, reaction) with no substantive tangents."
