  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the doctor's plan from [D-43] as described in the Gold Answer, including physical exam (listen to chest), vitals check, COVID swab, labs and vitals as criteria, consultation with attending, and disposition decision (admit vs. home). Minor discrepancy: omits the preliminary clinical impression of COPD exacerbation due to infection and specific reference to temperature check context from earlier dialogue; however, no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: physical exam (auscultation and vitals), COVID swab, labs (mentioned in criteria), disposition criteria (labs/vitals), consult attending, return to discuss. Missed: explicit preliminary impression ('COPD exacerbation, maybe... infection'), temperature context from [D-11]/[P-10], patient agreement [P-43]. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer directly verifiable in [D-43]: 'physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest', 'covid swab', 'labs in your vital signs', 'talk to my attending', 'decide... stay in the ER and be admitted, or... good to go home', 'come back and talk to you'. No hallucinations or unverifiable details; vitals implicitly include temperature as planned.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response around examinations/tests (physical, vitals, COVID), consultations (attending), criteria (labs/vitals), and disposition (ER admission vs. discharge), with no off-topic content."
