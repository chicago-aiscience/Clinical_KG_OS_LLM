    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists specific absent features: bullseye rash (D-6/P-6), joint pain (D-7/P-7), fever/illness (D-8/P-8), headaches (D-19/P-19-20), feeling well (D-18/P-18), no other bites (P-9). Generated covers bullseye (correct but cites P-1 instead of P-6), joint pain (cites D-7 but misinterprets P-1/P-7 denial), fever/ill (cites D-8 correctly but stretches P-14 implication incorrectly). Misses headaches, feeling well, no bites. Diagnostic tests match main points (phys exam, tick ID, bloodwork per D-18) but omits physician consult, deer tick details. 'Knowledge graph' is erroneous. Some factual errors in citations/interpretations but core features/tests align.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: bullseye rash, joint pain, fever/illness, phys exam, tick ID, bloodwork (60-70%). Missed: headaches, feeling well otherwise, no other bites, physician consult, bite site specifics, tick in container, deer tick vector. Partial coverage of clinical (3/6) and diagnostic (3/4).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly grounded: bullseye (D-6 verifiable, denial in P-6 not P-1), joint pain (D-7/P-7 verifiable but P-1 misinterpreted), fever (D-8/P-8 verifiable, D-18/P-14 stretch as P-14 is about cholesterol not illness), tests (D-18 accurate). 'Knowledge graph' hallucinated/not in transcript. Minor unverifiable implications but multiple citation/interpretation issues.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly structures response into 'Clinical Features Assessed and Found Absent' and 'Diagnostic Tests Proposed' sections, perfectly mirroring the question without tangents."
