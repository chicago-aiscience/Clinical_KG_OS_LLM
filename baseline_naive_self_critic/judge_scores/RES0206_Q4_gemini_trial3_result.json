{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID), the test (COVID swab), and the specific social contact detail (walking with a sick friend in close proximity). These match the Gold Answer and the transcript exactly.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the three specific components requested in the prompt. However, it misses the additional context provided in the Gold Answer regarding the negative screens for other COVID symptoms (smell, taste, confusion, aches) and travel history, which the Gold Answer includes as part of the diagnostic process.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is mostly grounded in the transcript. However, the generated answer includes a hallucination/external reference to a 'knowledge graph' ('...cited in the knowledge graph'), which is not present in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses each part of the user's question without unnecessary filler."
