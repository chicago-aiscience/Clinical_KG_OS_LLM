  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies Tylenol as the home medication for headache relief, matching Gold's facts and citations [P-3]/[P-4]. Doctor's recommendations for hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, and Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches are fully consistent. However, it omits the patient's self-initiated hydration efforts [P-30], the explicit note of no prescription medications, COVID swab test, and 14-day isolation [D-52], which Gold includes as part of the management plan. Core facts are correct with minor omissions/discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Covers: Tylenol for headache [P-3]; doctor's supportive measures (hydration, nutritious food, sleeping well [D-52]); medications (Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches [D-52]). Misses: patient's hydration efforts [P-30]; no prescription meds; COVID test and isolation instructions [D-52]. Covers ~85% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims from transcript are accurate and verifiable ([P-3], [D-52]). Headache-Tylenol link is contextually grounded despite no explicit 'for headache' statement. However, references to 'knowledge graph' and specific KG relationship are not present in the transcript, introducing unverifiable details/hallucination.",
    "relevance": "Directly and comprehensively addresses the question by structuring response around patient's pre-visit medication/symptom and doctor's recommended medications/supportive measures, with no off-topic content."
