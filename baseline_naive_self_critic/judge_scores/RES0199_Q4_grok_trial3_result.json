  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-52]. It correctly specifies the swab test and 24-48 hour turnaround time, directly from [D-52]. The alternative diagnosis of another viral illness if negative is precisely quoted and matches both Gold and transcript. Minor quote discrepancy ('as covid' vs 'is covid') but no factual error.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer and question: condition (COVID-19), test (swab), turnaround (24-48 hours), alternative diagnosis (another viral illness). Generated covers 100%: all four elements explicitly addressed with citations. Gold's extras (isolation, contact tracing, management) not required by question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript [D-52]: quotes and paraphrases accurate (minor 'as' vs 'is' negligible). Citations correct. No hallucinated facts; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured perfectly around the question's four components (condition, test, turnaround, alternative), with no off-topic content or tangents."
