  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding symptom constancy. The transcript shows the patient initially said 'on and off' [P-1] but explicitly clarified when asked directly that symptoms were 'pretty constant for the past week' [P-8]. The Generated Answer incorrectly concludes symptoms were intermittent, contradicting this clarification. The chronological progression (stuffy first, then runny) is correct, and the timeframe (one week) is accurate.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the basic chronological progression (stuffy first, then runny) and timeframe (one week), which represents approximately 50-60% of key points. However, it misses several important details from the Gold Answer: (1) the clarification about constant vs intermittent nature, (2) the potential influence of decongestants on symptom transition, (3) the lack of improvement prompting the visit, and (4) the nuanced explanation of the apparent contradiction between initial 'on and off' description and later 'pretty constant' clarification.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains one major hallucination/misrepresentation. While [P-1] does say 'on and off,' the patient explicitly corrected this when asked directly [D-8/P-8], stating symptoms were 'pretty constant.' The Generated Answer ignores this clarification and incorrectly concludes symptoms were intermittent. The rest of the content is grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: chronological progression, first symptom, change in predominant symptom, and constancy vs intermittency. The structure follows the question's requirements systematically. However, the incorrect conclusion about intermittency represents a failure to accurately address that specific sub-question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the chronological progression (stuffy nose first, transitioning to runny nose over one week) but contains a critical factual error regarding symptom constancy. It incorrectly concludes symptoms were intermittent based solely on [P-1], ignoring the patient's explicit clarification in [P-8] that symptoms were 'pretty constant.' This represents both a correctness and faithfulness issue. The answer covers basic elements but misses important nuances about decongestant use and the reconciliation of seemingly contradictory statements. While structurally relevant to the question, the factual error on a key dimension undermines overall quality."
