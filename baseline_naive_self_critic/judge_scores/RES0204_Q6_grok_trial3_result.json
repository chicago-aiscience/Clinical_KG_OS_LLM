  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), consultation with supervising physician, and follow-up discussion, matching the Gold Answer's core elements. Minor discrepancies include not noting the tentative nature of the chest X-ray ('might want' per supervising doctor), omitting the physical exam (listen to lungs/heart) as part of the initial plan from [D-1], and slightly misattributing citations, but no major factual errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: diagnostic tests (both), consultation, follow-up return with doctor, explanations/reassurance. Missed: explicit visit structure including physical exam of lungs/heart [D-1], tentative phrasing for X-ray, patient/mother acknowledgment [P-40], and concluding thanks. Covers approximately 85% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: tests [D-37, D-39], consultation [D-1, D-37], follow-up [D-1, D-40], reassurances [D-37, D-39]. Citations are mostly accurate (minor overlap in [D-39] covering both X-ray explanation and swab). No hallucinations or fabricated content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured to directly address the question's requirements (tests, consultation, follow-up steps), using clear sections and staying focused on the communicated plan without irrelevant tangents."
