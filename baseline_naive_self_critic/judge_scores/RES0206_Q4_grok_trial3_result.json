  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the condition as COVID (minor discrepancy with Gold's COVID-19, but matches transcript's 'covid'), the test as covid swab with accurate citation [D-43], and the key social contact detail from [P-20] about walking dogs with a sick friend and getting too close. Core facts align fully with Gold and transcript; only minor phrasing differences and no significant errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: condition (COVID-19/COVID), test (covid swab [D-43]), main social contact detail (friends walking dogs, one sick, too close [P-20]). Partially covers prompting details like outdoor safety feeling. Missed: patient's uncertainty about friend's COVID test [P-21], doctor's screening for COVID symptoms (smell/taste/confusion/muscle aches [P-32-35]), travel denial [P-31], and explanatory context on why test despite no symptoms. Covers ~85% of Gold's points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims verifiable: condition/test from [D-43], social contacts from [P-20]. Citations accurate. Minor unverifiable detail: 'cited in the knowledge graph' (not in transcript). No other hallucinations; fully grounded otherwise.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question's three elements (condition, test, prompting social contact detail) with structured response and summary; no off-topic content."
