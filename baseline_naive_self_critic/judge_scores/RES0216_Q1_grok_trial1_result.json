  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details a 3-day diffuse chest tightness worsening with inspiration/exertion/walks/deep breaths/chair, difficulty with full breath, upper airway hoarseness/phlegm/throat clearing without cough, and explicit denials of chest pain, anxiety/sweating/doom, fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, cough. Generated accurately captures chest tightness on inspiration, difficulty breathing/full breath, hoarseness/phlegm/throat clearing, and denials of chest pain/cough, but omits duration, diffuseness, specific triggers, and most denials (fevers etc.), incorrectly claiming no explicit denials for fevers/night sweats/chills/weight loss/anxiety/sweating in transcript, contradicting Gold and transcript (P-6,12-15). Significant factual errors on denials.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: chest tightness details (partial: tightness on breathe-in but misses 3-day/diffuse/worsens walks/chair/deep breath), full breath difficulty (yes), upper airway hoarse/phlegm/clearing no cough (yes), denials chest pain (yes), cough (yes), but misses anxiety/sweating/doom, fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss. Covers ~60% (strong on present symptoms details, weak on full denial list).",
    "faithfulness": "All cited quotes verifiable (P-1,5,7,11; D-34,36 accurate). Symptom claims grounded. Note claiming 'no explicit denials' for fevers etc. incorrect (P-6,12-15 exist), but rest no hallucination; minor unverifiable detail.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response around present symptoms (categorized chest/respiratory/upper airway) and explicit denials of listed screened symptoms, directly matching question; no off-topic content."
