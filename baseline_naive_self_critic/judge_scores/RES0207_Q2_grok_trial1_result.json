  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication prescribed [P-23], matching the Gold Answer. It accurately references the patient's statement about forgetting the medication [P-9], which is consistent with the Gold. However, it omits the explicit link to the chronic condition (epilepsy [P-8, P-22]) and fails to detail the specific circumstance (daughter's birthday celebration disrupting dinner routine [P-24]), representing minor discrepancies while core facts remain correct.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Keppra for epilepsy [P-23, P-8]; (2) forgot med [P-9]; (3) daughter's birthday celebration [P-24]; (4) usual dinner timing with med, but earlier celebration changed routine, no later dinner, forgot [P-24]; (5) doctor acknowledgment of common occurrence and isolated lapse [D-25, D-24, P-24]; (6) patient links miss to seizure [P-9]. Covered: (1 partial, med only), (2). Missed: epilepsy explicit, (3-6). Covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: Keppra [P-23], exact quote 'kind of forgot to take my med' [P-9]. Citations accurate. No hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured with bullet points directly addressing the two-part question (medication and circumstance), with no off-topic content or tangents. Perfectly focused."
