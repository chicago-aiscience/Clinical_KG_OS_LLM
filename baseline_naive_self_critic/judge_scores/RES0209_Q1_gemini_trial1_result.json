{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the transcript and gold answer regarding the character of the cough, the shortness of breath, the presence of wheezing, and the relative frequency of symptoms between day and night. It correctly cites the relevant speaker turns.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses one specific symptom category explicitly requested in the prompt: 'chest sensations'. The Gold Answer includes chest tightness (based on D-20/P-20), whereas the Generated Answer omits it. Additionally, it omits the 'two-week' duration of the cough mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript. The citations [P-1], [P-9], [P-11], [P-15], and [P-18] are used correctly and correspond to the speaker's statements.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's multi-part structure, although the omission of chest sensations makes it slightly less than perfectly focused on the requested details."
