  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the constancy of symptoms. While it correctly identifies the initial stuffy nose and progression to runny nose, it states the symptoms were 'intermittent' based on [P-1], contradicting the patient's clarification in [P-8] that symptoms have been 'pretty constant for the past week.' The Gold Answer correctly captures both the initial 'on and off' description and the later clarification of constant symptoms, explaining this apparent discrepancy. This is a meaningful error affecting the accuracy of the clinical picture.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers several key points: one-week duration, initial stuffiness, progression to runny nose, and references the appropriate transcript segments. However, it critically omits the clarification about symptoms being constant [P-8], which the Gold Answer highlights as important. It also misses the mention of decongestant use potentially influencing symptom evolution [P-10] and the patient's motivation for seeking care (symptoms not improving). Coverage is approximately 60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is mostly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it makes an interpretation error by stating symptoms were 'intermittent' without acknowledging the patient's later clarification that they were 'pretty constant.' This represents a misinterpretation of the transcript content rather than hallucination, but it does fail to fully represent what the patient actually said. The citations provided are accurate but incomplete.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: chronological progression, first symptom, change in predominance, and constancy/intermittency of symptoms. The structure is clear and organized, making it easy to follow. Despite the factual error, the response stays focused on the nasal symptom timeline without including irrelevant information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer appropriately addresses the question's structure and provides relevant information about symptom progression, but contains a significant factual error by characterizing symptoms as intermittent when the patient clarified they were constant. It covers most key points but omits important details about the patient's clarification regarding symptom constancy and the potential influence of decongestant use. While mostly faithful to the transcript with accurate citations, it fails to represent the complete picture by not reconciling the initial 'on and off' description with the later 'pretty constant' clarification."
