  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains factually correct information but has timing errors. The cough duration is understated as 'a couple of days' when the transcript shows it started Friday with worsening Sunday (almost a week per D-4). The red spots in sputum are correctly mentioned but the full description 'yellow custard with little spots of red' is incomplete. Chest pain location is correct. Chills are mentioned but fever is completely omitted despite being explicitly stated in P-8. The chest pain quality (dull, constant, worsening with deep breathing/coughing) is missing.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only about 40-50% of key points from the Gold Answer. Missing elements include: cough timeline details (Friday raspy, Sunday severe), sputum appearing 'all at once' on Sunday, detailed chest pain characteristics (constant, dull, present at rest, worse with breathing/coughing), subjective fevers starting Monday, timing of chills (last two days), dyspnea on exertion, sore throat, previous runny nose, and pertinent negative of no weight loss. The answer provides a bare skeleton without clinical detail.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. However, the answer is overly selective and minimal. The cough duration reference to P-1 is misleading as P-1 says 'last couple of days' but later clarification in P-2, P-3 shows it started earlier. The citations are accurate but incomplete - more comprehensive transcript evidence exists for each symptom.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question's core components (sputum, chest pain, systemic symptoms) but provides minimal detail. It stays on topic without tangents but fails to provide the comprehensive clinical picture requested by the question, particularly regarding 'description' and 'quality' of symptoms."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides factually accurate but severely incomplete information. While it correctly identifies key symptom categories (cough, sputum appearance, chest pain location, chills), it omits critical details including fever, complete chest pain characterization, symptom timeline, and other reported symptoms. The answer covers less than half of the Gold Answer's key points and lacks the clinical depth needed for proper medical documentation."
