  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details hereditary risk from family history (mom's epilepsy [P-26]) linking to patient's diagnosis [P-8], and medication non-adherence (missed Keppra [P-23, P-24] due to birthday, infrequent seizures [P-9]). Generated correctly identifies core facts of forgotten med [P-9] and family history (mom [P-26]) relating to genetic predisposition and diagnosis [P-8], but omits specifics like Keppra name, exact reason for missing dose, infrequency of seizures, and clinician's question [D-26]; introduces 'knowledge graph' not in Gold, but core facts align with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: hereditary (runs in family, mom [P-26], clinician question [D-26], genetic link to [P-8]); med (Keppra [P-23], birthday reason [P-24], precipitated seizure [P-9], infrequent seizures [P-9], well-controlled, combination. Generated covers med forgetfulness [P-9], hereditary (mom [P-26]), relation to diagnosis [P-8, P-26] (~80% core points: main risks and relation), misses med specifics (name, reason), infrequency, clinician prompt, explicit combination.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims [P-9], [P-26], [P-8] verifiable in transcript. However, multiple references to non-existent 'knowledge graph' (identifies factors, links history to diagnosis, [MEDICAL_HISTORY] node) are hallucinations not grounded in transcript; rest mostly verifiable.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists hereditary and med risks with citations, explains family history relation to diagnosis via predisposition and links to patient's confirmation [P-8, P-26]; perfectly focused on question despite extraneous knowledge graph mentions."
