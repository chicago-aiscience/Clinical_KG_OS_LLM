  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify the frequency of diarrhea (when P-28 clearly states 'five or six times a day'), incorrectly states the number of vomiting episodes is not specified (when P-32 clearly states 'two times'), and incorrectly states no numerical severity scale was provided for the headache (when P-8 clearly states '7' on a 1-10 scale). The cough characterization as dry is correct [P-12].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses multiple key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the absence of sputum/blood in cough, respiratory negatives (no shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain), the liquid nature of stools, absence of blood in stools/vomit, GI negatives (no bloating, constipation), headache location (forehead/top of head, bilateral), lack of radiation/neck stiffness, the unusual nature of the headache for this patient, loss of smell, and mild fatigue. It covers less than 30% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "While the Generated Answer attempts to ground claims in the transcript with citations, it makes multiple claims that directly contradict what is stated in the transcript. Specifically, it states information is 'not specified' when it clearly is specified in the referenced exchanges (P-28 for diarrhea frequency, P-32 for vomiting episodes, P-8 for headache severity). These are factual errors rather than hallucinations, but represent unfaithfulness to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address all components of the question (GI symptoms, respiratory symptoms, cough nature, diarrhea frequency, vomiting episodes, headache severity) but provides incomplete or incorrect information for most of them. It stays focused on the question without tangents, but the quality of the answers is poor."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question but contains critical factual errors by claiming key information (diarrhea frequency: 5-6 times/day, vomiting episodes: 2 times, headache severity: 7/10) is not specified when it clearly is in the transcript. It correctly identifies the dry cough but omits the majority of relevant details including respiratory and GI negatives, symptom timeline specifics, headache location/characteristics, loss of smell, and fatigue. The response demonstrates poor faithfulness to the source material with multiple direct contradictions."
