  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the four reported symptoms (fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle ache) matching the Gold Answer's list and providing accurate citations from the transcript. However, it introduces a factual error by hallucinating a current 'rash' as a reported symptom based on [P-38], which actually describes an allergic reaction to penicillin, not a current symptom. For denials, it lists the five symptoms correctly but inaccurately states they were denied due to 'lack of mention' rather than explicit denials when asked, contradicting the Gold Answer's precise citations (e.g., [P-10] for cough, [P-8] for headache) and omitting details like nausea/vomiting together; it also misattributes an explicit negative to [P-27] (neck swelling, not listed). These are significant factual errors and contradictions on the denials, a core part of the question.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Four symptoms with details/timings/citations (stuffy nose first [P-1,D-2/3], sore throat persistent [P-1], fever 3 days [P-1], muscle aches 2-3 days with fever [P-13-16]); covered fully. (2) Explicit denials of five symptoms with specific citations and details (cough [P-10], headache [P-8], neck stiffness [P-7], nausea/vomiting [P-5], difficulty swallowing with swallow ability and no aspiration [P-24-26]); Generated lists the five but misses all citations, details (e.g., vomiting, swallowing specifics), and explicit nature, using wrong 'lack of mention' reasoning. Additional Gold denials (e.g., abdominal pain) not required. Covers symptoms 100%, denials ~50% (list only), overall 50-79%.",
    "faithfulness": "Reported symptoms claims verifiable with accurate citations [P-1, P-13]. Rash note hallucinates current symptom from allergy history [P-38:D-38]. Denied symptoms: 'did not report' partially true (as positives), but 'lack of mention constitutes denial' false as doctor explicitly asked and she denied (e.g., cough [D-10:P-10 'No cough'], headache [D-8:P-8], etc.); wrongly cites [P-27] (neck swelling denial) as the 'one explicit negative.' Multiple inaccuracies and hallucinations in denial handling and extra rash claim, not fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around 'Reported Symptoms' (four listed) and 'Denied Symptoms' (exact five queried), addressing the question precisely; minor tangent in rash note and erroneous denial explanation do not derail focus."
