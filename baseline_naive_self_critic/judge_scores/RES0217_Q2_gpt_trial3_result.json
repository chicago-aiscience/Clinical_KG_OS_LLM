  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the transcript and Gold Answer on all included items: (1) the patient is on an unspecified statin for cholesterol [P-15]; (2) the clinician proposed prophylactic antibiotics due to likely prolonged attachment time [D-6]; and (3) the patient previously took antibiotics after a prior tick bite with a target/bullseye rash [P-3]. It does not introduce incorrect drug names, doses, or durations, consistent with the Gold Answer (none were specified).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: current statin therapy (unspecified), prior antibiotics for previous tick bite, and proposed prophylactic antibiotics for this tick bite.\nKey Gold Answer elements missed: denial of allergies/no drug allergies [P-16, P-17]; plan to send the tick for lab identification and consider bloodwork/serology [D-6, D-18]; plan to consult the supervising physician before finalizing [D-13, D-22]; environmental prevention suggestion (consider insecticide) [D-18]. Overall, it captures the main medication points but omits several other discussed treatments/plans.",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive clinical claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript. It does not hallucinate specific antibiotics or other therapies. The phrase about a \"knowledge graph\" is not from the transcript but does not add clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on medications/treatments discussed (statin, prophylactic antibiotics, prior antibiotics) and directly addresses the question. It does not add irrelevant clinical content."
