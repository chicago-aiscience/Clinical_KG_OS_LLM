  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the key elements from [D-43] including: physical exam, vitals check, COVID swab, consultation with attending, and decision criteria based on labs and vital signs. The answer correctly identifies the disposition decision (ER admission vs. discharge home). The answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer's core content.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points but misses some details present in the Gold Answer: (1) specific mention of 'auscultation of the chest' vs just 'listen to chest', (2) the preliminary clinical impression of COPD exacerbation likely from infection, (3) explicit mention of temperature checking context from [D-11] and [P-10], (4) the note that specific labs beyond COVID are not named, and (5) patient's agreement [P-43]. Covers approximately 70-75% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, particularly in [D-43]. The answer stays grounded in the source material and does not add unverifiable information or hallucinate facts. The summary is faithful to what was actually stated in the consultation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about the comprehensive plan including examinations, tests, consultations, and decision criteria. It is well-organized and focused on the specific elements requested. Minor formatting differences don't detract from relevance."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate and relevant response that captures the core elements of the doctor's plan from [D-43]. It correctly identifies all major components (physical exam, vitals, COVID swab, attending consultation, and decision criteria). However, it lacks some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the preliminary clinical impression, temperature check context, and patient agreement. The answer is completely faithful to the transcript with no hallucinations."
