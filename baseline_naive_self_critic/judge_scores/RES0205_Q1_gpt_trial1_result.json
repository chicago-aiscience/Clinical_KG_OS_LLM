  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the key ongoing symptom of a persistent cough for two weeks and that it is currently dry. It also correctly notes chest discomfort associated with excessive coughing; however, it labels this as “chest pain,” whereas the transcript indicates the patient denies true chest pain and instead describes mild soreness/hurt only after coughing a lot. Resolved symptoms (sore throat, runny nose, earlier mucus) are consistent with the transcript, though not as precisely specified as in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Included: persistent cough; currently dry; chest soreness with coughing; initial sore throat/runny nose/mucus that resolved.\nMissing vs Gold Answer: (1) the specific timelines (sore throat 2–3 days; mucus 4–5 days; everything else resolved in 3–4 days), (2) cough frequency estimate (3–4 times/hour), (3) spontaneous/no triggers, (4) stable intensity and stable frequency over time, and (5) explicitly denied associated symptoms listed in Gold Answer (no dyspnea, no fever, no nausea/vomiting, no abdominal pain). Overall, it captures the main symptom set but omits many of the “specific” details requested and included in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations. The characterization of chest discomfort as “chest pain” is slightly overstated but still tied to the patient’s wording that the chest ‘hurts a little bit’ when coughing too much. The phrase “knowledge graph provided” is not supported by the transcript context but does not add clinical facts.",
    "relevance": "The answer is focused on symptoms during the two-week illness, distinguishing current vs resolved symptoms. It does not add major irrelevant material."
