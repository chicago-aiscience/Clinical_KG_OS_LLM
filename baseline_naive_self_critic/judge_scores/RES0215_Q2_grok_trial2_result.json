  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine and over-the-counter medications as the only treatments mentioned, and accurately notes no prescribed medications, aligning with the Gold Answer's core facts. However, it inaccurately attributes statements to 'the patient' (the 8-year-old child who does not speak) instead of the mother, fails to specify that these are for seasonal allergies (not respiratory symptoms), does not mention no medications for current respiratory episodes, and references a non-existent 'knowledge graph'. These are significant discrepancies from the Gold Answer's precise details.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) no medications for current wheezing/SOB episodes, resolves on own [P-33,P-34]; (2) occasional OTC Reactine/antihistamines specifically for seasonal allergies [P-35,P-36]; (3) explicitly no prescribed medications [P-36, P-46, P-47]; (4) past viral infections required no antibiotics [P-16]. Generated covers (2) partially (Reactine/OTC but without specifying allergies or citing P-35) and (3) (no prescribed), but misses (1) entirely and (4), covering roughly 50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine and OTC from [P-36] are verifiable in transcript, and no prescribed matches [P-36]. However, 'patient explicitly stated' is incorrect as [P-*] are mother's statements (child does not speak); seasonal allergies link is implied but 'knowledge graph [KG]' is fully hallucinated/not in transcript. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated elements present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists medications/treatments (Reactine/OTC), specifies no prescribed medications, and ties to conditions, perfectly addressing the question despite inaccuracies; minor tangent with KG."
