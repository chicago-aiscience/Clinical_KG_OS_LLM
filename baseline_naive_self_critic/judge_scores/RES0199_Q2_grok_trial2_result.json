  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies Tylenol as the home medication for headache relief, matching Gold with correct citations [P-3]. Doctor's recommendations for hydration, nutritious food, sleeping well, Tylenol for fevers, and Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches/pains are fully consistent. However, it omits the patient's self-hydration efforts [P-30], the COVID-19 swab test, 14-day isolation, and explicit note of no prescription medications, representing minor discrepancies but core facts intact.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: Tylenol for headache (✓), doctor's supportive measures (hydration, food, sleep ✓), Tylenol for fevers and Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches (✓). Missed: patient's self-hydration [P-30], COVID swab and isolation [D-52], no prescriptions. Covers ~70-80% of Gold's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All cited claims ([P-3], [D-52]) are directly verifiable in the transcript. The mention of a 'knowledge graph' and specific relationship is not present in the provided transcript, introducing a minor unverifiable detail, but core content is grounded without fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question, directly addressing the patient's home medication/symptom and doctor's recommendations with no off-topic content."
