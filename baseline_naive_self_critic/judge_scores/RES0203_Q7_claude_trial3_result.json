  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the symptom timeline. It states that the transcript 'does not specify an order of onset' and suggests the cough was mentioned 'subsequently,' when the Gold Answer clearly shows the patient confirmed all symptoms started 'at the same time' per P-6. The Generated Answer also fails to mention the partial nature of sensory losses (can smell very strong odors, taste very salty foods) which is a key clinical detail. However, it correctly identifies the 2-day duration and lack of prior similar episodes.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 60% of key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies: 1) two-day duration, 2) no prior similar symptoms, 3) consistency without worsening. However, it misses: 1) explicit confirmation that all symptoms started simultaneously, 2) specific details about partial sensory loss (strong odors, salty foods, banana example), 3) the doctor's COVID assessment context, 4) direct citation of the specific exchange confirming simultaneous onset [D-6, P-6], 5) explicit statements about consistency [D-5, P-5, D-8, P-8].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript but contains interpretation that contradicts available evidence. The claim that 'the transcript does not specify an order of onset' is contradicted by P-6 where the patient confirms the dry cough started 'at the same time.' The statement about the cough being mentioned 'subsequently' is an interpretive claim not supported by the text. The partial sensory loss details (P-4) are completely omitted. Most other claims are verifiable in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's components: timing of symptom onset, relative onset between symptoms, worsening/fluctuation, and prior similar episodes. However, it provides less precise detail than requested and uses hedging language ('does not specify') where the transcript actually does provide this information. The answer stays on topic throughout."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the main question but contains a significant factual error by stating the transcript doesn't specify simultaneous onset when P-6 explicitly confirms this. It correctly identifies the 2-day duration and lack of prior symptoms but misses critical clinical details about partial sensory loss (strong odors, salty foods). The answer covers about 60% of key points and is mostly grounded in the transcript, though it contradicts available evidence about simultaneous onset. While generally relevant to the question, the hedging language and missing specific citations reduce precision."
