  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer lists four main reported symptoms: sore throat (with details), difficulty breathing (major, with details), reduced sense of taste, fatigue/muscle aches. Generated covers sore throat partially, fatigue/aches partially, but completely omits difficulty breathing (a core symptom confirmed in P-7 to P-11) and reduced taste (P-19-P-21). Misclassifies loss of smell as 'reported' despite denial. For denials, Gold lists explicit denials for cough (P-15 'No'), runny nose (P-16), headaches (P-17), chest pain (P-18), loss of smell (P-19), fever (P-23), chills (P-24). Generated incorrectly claims only loss of smell explicitly denied and others not (despite direct 'No' responses), constituting significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key reported points from Gold: sore throat (4 days, worsening, swallowing food issue), breathing difficulty (yesterday, constant, worsening, novel), taste reduction (2 days, constant), fatigue/aches (post-sore throat). Generated covers ~50% of sore throat/fatigue/aches but misses breathing (25% of reported) and taste entirely. Denials: covers 1/7 (loss of smell), misses 6 explicit ones. Overall covers 20-49% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Citations accurate (e.g., P-2 for sore throat, P-25 for aches/fatigue, P-19), but hallucinates loss of smell under 'reported symptoms' (P-19 denies smell, reports taste which is omitted). Falsely claims no explicit denials for cough etc. despite direct 'No' in transcript (P-15-P-18, P-23-P-24). Multiple misinterpretations of explicit denials as non-explicit, introducing hallucinated facts about what constitutes 'explicit denial'.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around 'Reported Symptoms' and 'Explicit Denials of Commonly Screened Symptoms', mirroring question's two parts with lists matching the queried symptoms (cough etc.). Minor confusion in categorizing loss of smell, but no off-topic content."
