  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple major timeline errors compared with the Gold Answer. (1) Raspy cough onset is incorrect: transcript indicates a “bit of a raspy cough” on Friday with worsening Sunday [P-3], but the Generated Answer says the illness began Sunday with raspy cough. (2) Fever is omitted entirely, despite clear onset Monday and persistence to Wednesday [P-8]. (3) Chest pain timing is incorrect: transcript suggests it was specifically noticed “over the last day” (i.e., ~Tuesday) [P-20], but the Generated Answer places it on Wednesday without noting the reported onset window. (4) It implies Tylenol use as a Monday development, but transcript does not tie Tylenol to Monday—only that he has taken Tylenol at home [P-14]. (5) It adds an unsupported claim about a “knowledge graph” and that exertion exacerbates chest pain; transcript links chest pain worsening to coughing/deep breath [P-18, P-19], not exertion.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements missing or inadequately covered: (a) runny nose ~1 week prior and resolved [P-16] (missed); (b) Friday onset of raspy cough [P-3] (misdated); (c) Sunday marked worsening of cough and simultaneous onset of yellow sputum + red spots [P-3, P-4, P-6, P-7] (partially covered but cough worsening not clearly stated and raspy cough misdated); (d) Monday onset of subjective fever and persistence to Wednesday [P-8] (missed); (e) continuation of blood-tinged sputum into Monday [P-5] (not clearly stated as ongoing); (f) chills especially last two days (Tue–Wed) [P-9] (covered); (g) chest pain onset ~Tuesday, constant/dull, worse with cough/deep breath [P-18, P-19, P-20, P-21] (partially covered; onset and characteristics largely missing/incorrect); (h) overall worsening clinical picture through the week (only superficially summarized).",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or are mis-grounded in the transcript: (1) Sunday as initial onset of raspy cough is contradicted by Friday onset [P-3]. (2) “The last couple of days” [P-1] is used to justify Sunday onset, but the patient explicitly corrects to Sunday for worsening and notes Friday for initial raspy cough [P-2, P-3]. (3) Tylenol use is arbitrarily assigned to Monday without transcript support. (4) The “knowledge graph supports…” sentence is a clear hallucination (no knowledge graph in transcript) and the claim about exertion exacerbating chest pain is not stated. Overall, multiple inaccuracies reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at providing a symptom-by-day timeline, which is relevant to the question, but it fails to specify the onset day for several requested symptoms (notably fever) and misassigns onset days for others (raspy cough, chest pain). It also includes irrelevant/unsupported commentary about a “knowledge graph.”"
