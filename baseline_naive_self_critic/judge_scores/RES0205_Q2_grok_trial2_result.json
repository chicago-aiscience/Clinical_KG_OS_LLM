  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient is not taking anxiety medication (stopped 2-3 years ago, citing P-24) and manages acid reflux via dietary avoidance of acidic foods and chocolate (helped quite a bit, citing P-25), which is fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. No factual errors or contradictions in the information provided.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) no prescribed meds overall [P-23]; (2) anxiety meds stopped 2-3 years ago [P-24]; (3) acid reflux managed by diet (avoid acidic/chocolate, helped) no meds [P-25]; (4) hay fever no treatment [P-27]; (5) cough no meds prescribed yet, patient asked [P-35,D-37]; (6) zero meds across all conditions. Generated covers (2) and (3) fully, implies no meds for these but misses (1), (4), (5), (6). Covers ~50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: anxiety history [P-24], reflux management details [P-25], with accurate citations. No hallucinations, unverifiable details, or fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses medication/treatment for anxiety and acid reflux (explicitly required in question), using structured format, but omits hay fever, cough (current condition), and overall no-meds status, making it mostly relevant without off-topic content."
