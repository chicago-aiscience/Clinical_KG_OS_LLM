  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the medical instructions provided in the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab, the 14-day isolation period, the condition for contact tracing, and the list of supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics, and NSAIDs).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points but omits the expected timeframe for the test results (24-48 hours), which was included in the Gold Answer as part of the diagnostic management section. It also omits the mention of 'another viral illness' as a possible alternative diagnosis, though it mentions the management is the same regardless of the diagnosis.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains meta-commentary such as '(Knowledge Graph confirms...)' which is not present in the source transcript. While these statements are medically sound, they constitute information brought in from outside the provided text, slightly reducing faithfulness to the source alone.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address each component of the multi-part question."
