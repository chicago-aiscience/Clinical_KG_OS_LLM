  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the Gold Answer regarding Claritin and the allergy shots. The details provided about the indication for Claritin and the frequency of the allergy shots match the transcript exactly.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. It fails to mention the oral contraceptive 'Deyo' (a 3-month pill), which is a medication Jessica is currently taking regularly. It also omits the denial of medication allergies and the confirmation that she does not carry an EpiPen, both of which were included in the Gold Answer and requested by the prompt's scope of medications currently taking or carrying.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript. The citations [P-16], [P-20], and [P-25] correctly correspond to the claims made, and there are no hallucinations regarding the medications it did list.",
    "relevance": "The response is highly relevant to the question, focusing specifically on the medications and treatments mentioned. However, it lacks depth by missing one of the primary medications requested."
