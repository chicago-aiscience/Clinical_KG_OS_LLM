  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states that symptoms began about a week prior and that congestion (stuffy nose) came first with a shift to predominantly runny nose later in the week (consistent with [P-2], [P-3]). However, it is factually wrong about the symptom pattern: it concludes the symptoms were intermittent (“on and off”) rather than constant, directly contradicting the patient’s later clarification that symptoms have been “pretty constant for the past week” ([P-8]). Given the question explicitly asks constant vs intermittent, this is a significant error.",
    "completeness": "It includes: (1) ~1 week duration, (2) first symptom = stuffiness, (3) shift in predominant symptom to rhinorrhea. It misses key Gold Answer elements: the important reconciliation of “on and off” ([P-1]) with the later clarification of “pretty constant” ([P-8]); the note that symptoms were not improving prompting the visit ([P-1]); and the possible influence of decongestants on symptom change ([P-10]).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript (duration, initial stuffiness, later mostly running). The statement that the history indicates an intermittent pattern “rather than constant” is not faithful to the overall transcript because it ignores/overrides the explicit later answer that symptoms were “pretty constant” ([P-8]). This is more a misinterpretation/cherry-picking than a pure hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the nasal symptom timeline (onset, first symptom, progression, constancy/intermittency) and does not introduce unrelated content."
