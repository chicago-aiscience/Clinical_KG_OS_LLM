  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains multiple significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the frequency of diarrhea episodes, the number of vomiting episodes, and a numerical headache severity rating are not present in the transcript. However, the transcript explicitly states: diarrhea occurred 'five or six times a day' (P-28), the patient 'vomited two times' (P-32), and the headache was rated 'probably like 7' (P-8). Only the nature of the cough (dry) was correctly identified.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide three of the four specific characteristics requested by the prompt (frequency of diarrhea, number of vomiting episodes, and severity rating). It also misses additional context provided in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of blood/sputum and the duration of symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The response exhibits poor grounding by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly stated. This represents a failure to accurately reflect the source content despite the citations provided.",
    "relevance": "The response is relevant in structure as it attempts to address each part of the user's multi-part question, but the lack of accurate content makes the relevance superficial."
