  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the cough began ~4–5 days before the visit and was not improving ([P-2], [P-4]). However, it makes major factual errors: (1) it claims there is “no clinical information” about runny nose, but the transcript clearly documents a runny nose for the past couple of days with clear discharge ([P-11], [P-12]); (2) it implies persistence or “worsened” symptoms, whereas the patient said the cough “kind of stayed the same” ([P-7]); (3) it introduces unsupported statements about a “clinical knowledge graph” and that the cough is the “primary reason” for imaging, which is not stated as such in the transcript. These issues substantially contradict the Gold Answer and source.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: cough onset 4–5 days and not getting better.\nKey points missed: cough characterized as dry and nonproductive throughout ([P-5], [P-6]); cough severity stable/no worsening or improvement ([P-7]); runny nose present for only the past couple of days and thus started later than the cough, with clear discharge ([P-11], [P-12]); comparison to prior episodes—never had a dry cough like this, previously had runny noses but not lasting this long ([P-24]); novelty of this episode supported by being otherwise healthy ([P-24]). Overall coverage is well under 50% of required details.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple elements are not grounded in the transcript: references to a “clinical knowledge graph,” the claim that the transcript lacks runny-nose information (directly contradicted by [P-11]/[P-12]), and the inference that procedures “confirm the focus on the cough.” The asthma/family history and lack of SOB/wheeze are grounded ([P-28]), and fever/chills comment is mostly grounded ([P-13]), but the key ungrounded/contradictory claims reduce faithfulness substantially.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address symptom development over time and prior history, but it fails to answer a central part of the question (relative timing/duration of runny nose vs cough) and misstates that no runny-nose information exists. Some content (knowledge-graph discussion) is extraneous. Still, much of the response stays within the symptom-timeline theme."
