  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the key elements in the Gold Answer: COVID swab ordered with 24–48 hour turnaround, symptoms assessed as consistent with COVID/infection, recommended 14-day isolation (including separating from younger sister), acknowledgement of possible false negatives, alternative diagnosis of another circulating viral illness if negative, and ER warning signs (high temperature, neurologic symptoms such as seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting). Minor discrepancy: it frames isolation as “strict” and says it “includes the patient's younger sister,” whereas the transcript specifies isolating “including from his younger sister possible” (i.e., separation from sister), but the intended meaning is essentially preserved.",
    "completeness": "Covers most Gold Answer elements: test + turnaround time, COVID-like/infectious assessment, 14-day isolation including from sister, false negatives, alternative viral illness if negative, and ER warning signs with an example (seizures). Misses the additional differential note that asthma would be considered if cough/SOB occurred without fever ([D-45]) and does not explicitly state the ‘no medications/watchful waiting’ aspect noted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by the transcript with correct citation to [D-44] and [D-45]. The opening phrase “Based on the provided transcript and knowledge graph” introduces an unverifiable element (no knowledge graph is provided), but it does not materially add clinical facts. Otherwise, content is grounded and non-hallucinatory.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question’s requested components (assessment, diagnostic test and turnaround, isolation period, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negatives, and ER warning signs with example). No meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "The answer is largely accurate, well-grounded, and on-topic, but it omits the asthma contingent differential and the explicit watchful-waiting/no-medication plan noted in the Gold Answer, with only minor wording imprecision about isolating from the sister."
