  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer links acid reflux to possible incomplete control leading to cough contribution; Generated correctly notes history and diet management but adds unmentioned LPR and 'Knowledge Graph'. Hay fever in Gold is historical sensitivity with no current symptoms/active role; Generated incorrectly posits it as likely ongoing driver via post-nasal drip. Occupational risk in Gold is potential acquisition with PPE use; Generated overstates re-exposure despite patient being homebound [P-36]. Post-viral pattern and anxiety context omitted or altered. Some errors but core relations discussed.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: acid reflux (history, diet-only management, partial control, known cough link), hay fever (history, no active role), occupational (hospital exposure, PPE/careful), post-viral pattern, anxiety/work distress. Generated covers histories and potential links for all three main factors but misses no-medication detail, 'helped quite a bit', explicit post-viral, anxiety; alters hay fever role. Covers ~80% of points with some nuance loss.",
    "faithfulness": "Acid reflux claims grounded [P-22,P-25] but LPR and Knowledge Graph hallucinated. Hay fever [P-27] grounded as history, but current post-nasal drip/chronic cough causation not in transcript (mucus only initial [P-6], now dry [P-5]). Occupational [P-34,P-17] grounded but re-infection/re-exposure contradicts home isolation [P-36]; viral shedding/prolonged recovery speculative. Multiple unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the three specified factors (acid reflux, hay fever, occupational exposure) with explanations tied to cough presentation, perfectly matching question focus without off-topic content."
