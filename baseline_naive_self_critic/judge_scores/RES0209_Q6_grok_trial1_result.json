  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript contains only patient responses (P-1 to P-39) with no clinician dialogue, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and the actual transcript which includes extensive [D-#] turns detailing the clinician's plan (e.g., D-29 for COVID swab, D-43 for medication change and consulting the doctor). All key facts about the plan are misrepresented as absent, making it fully inconsistent with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) COVID swab diagnostic test (D-29), (2) suggestion of medication change to better control asthma (D-43), (3) consultation with supervising physician before returning (D-29, D-43). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead summarizing patient symptoms and triggers which are not part of the clinician's plan.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript lacks all clinician dialogue, falsely stating it is 'exclusively' patient responses; this is unverifiable and contradicted by the full transcript (e.g., D-29 explicitly mentions COVID swab, D-43 mentions medication change and talking to the doctor). It also references a non-existent 'knowledge graph' and fabricates limitations not grounded in the source.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks for the clinician's plan including COVID test, medication change, and supervising physician consultation; the Generated Answer refuses to provide this (falsely claiming no data), then pivots to irrelevant patient symptom summary and asthma triggers, largely failing to address the query."
