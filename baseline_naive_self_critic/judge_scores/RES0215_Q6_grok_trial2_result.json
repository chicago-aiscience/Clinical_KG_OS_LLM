  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor's plan is 'not included' in the transcript, directly contradicting [D-58] where the doctor explicitly outlines the physical exam, consulting the physician, and discussing next steps; it also misrepresents environmental factors by including irrelevant 'colder weather' (not home-specific) and omitting key assessments like smoking, pets, fireplaces, and air filters, making it mostly incorrect vs Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers doctor's plan (3 steps + offer for questions) and full list of environmental factors (smoking, carpets, pets, fireplaces/stoves, air filters, townhouse context); Generated covers 0% of plan and only ~20% of environments (townhouse, carpets), missing the rest, so <20% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims of no plan are not verifiable and contradict [D-58]; environmental cites like [P-50] townhouse and [P-54] carpets are accurate, but 'colder weather' [P-38] is stretched/misapplied as home factor and multiple omissions lead to hallucinated incompleteness; multiple issues.",
    "relevance": "Addresses only partial environmental factors but completely denies/misses the doctor's plan (core of question), making it largely off-topic despite attempting to respond to second part."
