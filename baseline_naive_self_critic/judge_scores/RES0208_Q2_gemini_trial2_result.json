  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It claims that the specific medication for reflux is not mentioned, whereas the transcript explicitly mentions 'Tums' [P-27]. Furthermore, it states that there are no details regarding a change in the reflux regimen, which contradicts the transcript where the patient says he stopped his previous medication because he 'figured out the foods that were going to help' [P-27].",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete. It fails to identify Tums as a current medication and misses the entire second part of the question regarding the change in the reflux regimen and the reason for that change (dietary management).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails on faithfulness by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present in turn [P-27]. This is a form of negative hallucination (claiming absence of information).",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it correctly identifies Avodart and the associated prostate condition. However, it fails to provide the required information for the remaining parts of the multi-part question, instead providing incorrect negative assertions."
