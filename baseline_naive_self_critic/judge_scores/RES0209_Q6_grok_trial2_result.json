  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript contains only patient responses (P-1 to P-39) with no clinician dialogue, directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript which include full D-1 to D-44 turns detailing the plan (e.g., COVID swab in D-29, medication change in D-43, consulting doctor in D-29/D-43); this is a complete factual inaccuracy.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers three key points: COVID swab diagnostic test, suggestion to change medications, and consultation with supervising physician; Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead focusing on patient symptoms, triggers, and history.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that no clinician dialogue exists despite clear D-turns in transcript; fabricates goldfish as a trigger linked to occupational asthma (P-39 only mentions goldfish as pets, no trigger association); all claims about missing plan elements are unverifiable and false as they contradict the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks for the clinician's plan including COVID test, medication change, and supervising physician consultation; Generated Answer denies possibility due to alleged lack of clinician input and pivots to patient symptoms summary, failing to address the question."
