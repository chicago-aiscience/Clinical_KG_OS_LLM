  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly links scratchy throat + dry, nonproductive cough + headache/malaise to a likely URI and notes that lack of sputum makes a lower-respiratory, productive process less likely. However, it overstates that dry cough “rules out” pneumonia/lowers respiratory infection (it only makes it less suggestive). It also incorrectly treats “tired” as a proxy for subjective fever—Jessica explicitly reports feeling hot/feverish separately (P-7, P-9).",
    "completeness": "Covers: dry cough/scratchy throat; general unwell feeling/headache; some discussion of allergies vs infection; mentions absence of GI symptoms and joint pain in general terms. Misses or under-specifies several Gold key points: explicit 3–4 day timeline; explicit subjective fever details (hot day/night); explicit denials of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea with correct references; the brother’s recent cold as viral exposure; and that the doctor summarized this as dry cough + fever + headache (D-58).",
    "faithfulness": "Mostly grounded in the transcript (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, fatigue, seasonal allergies timing). But there are multiple issues: GI-symptom absence is cited to [P-1] (not where it appears), “pharynx and larynx” localization is not stated in the transcript, and “rules out pneumonia” is not supported. Overall, some extrapolation beyond what was said.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how the symptom pattern (URI-type symptoms plus absence of sputum/GI/joint pain) supports a URI assessment. No major tangents."
