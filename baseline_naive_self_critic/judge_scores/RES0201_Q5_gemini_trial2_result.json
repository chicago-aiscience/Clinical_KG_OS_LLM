  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the 40-year smoking history, the COPD diagnosis, and the medication (LABA). However, it incorrectly cites [P-34] for the 40-year history fact, which is actually found in [P-35]. It correctly identifies the doctor's plan for a COVID swab and chest X-ray.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to mention that the current breathing difficulty is 'unlike anything previously experienced' [P-11], which is a critical clinical distinction. 2) It omits the social context (living alone, retirement, limited outings) that the Gold Answer includes as relevant for exposure risk and isolation planning.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' as a source of information (e.g., 'The knowledge graph indicates...', 'The knowledge graph explicitly demonstrates...'). There is no knowledge graph in the provided transcript. While the medical logic inferred is plausible, referencing a non-existent source within the prompt context is a significant faithfulness error.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question regarding the smoking/COPD link and the relevance of COPD to the current presentation. It uses a clear, structured format."
