  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s end-of-visit plan stated in D-37: (1) listen to heart and lungs and do a quick physical exam, and (2) then consult the doctor they are working with, review what was discussed, and return to discuss next steps. It does not introduce contradictions or incorrect facts. Minor wording differences (e.g., “Feedback,” “plan for the future”) remain consistent with “talk to you about where to go from here.”",
    "completeness": "It covers the core plan elements from the Gold Answer: specified exam components (heart/lung auscultation + quick physical exam) and the collaborative/supervising-physician process to determine next steps. However, it omits several secondary points included in the Gold Answer: that this structure was foreshadowed at the beginning (D-1), that the patient agreed (P-37), and that no diagnosis/medication was provided at this stage and the transcript ends before findings/treatment. These are supportive/contextual details rather than the central requested plan, but they are part of the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All statements in the Generated Answer are directly supported by D-37. It does not add exam components, diagnoses, treatments, or other details not present in the transcript. No hallucinations noted.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the question: the planned exam components and the process for determining next steps. No extraneous content."
