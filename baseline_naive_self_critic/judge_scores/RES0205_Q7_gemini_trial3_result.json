  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually consistent with both the transcript and the Gold Answer. It accurately identifies the two-week duration, the four-to-five-day window for mucus production, the 'whitish clear' appearance of the mucus, and the transition to a dry cough. It also correctly notes the resolution of other symptoms within the first 3-4 days.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points present in the Gold Answer and specifically requested in the prompt. It fails to state that the cough's intensity and frequency remained stable/unchanged over time, instead mentioning chest soreness. It also omits specific details about the sore throat and runny nose (grouping them as 'flu-like symptoms'), the absence of fever, the negative COVID test result, and the patient's status regarding returning to work.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are well-grounded in the transcript. The references to P-2, P-14, P-6, P-5, and P-15 are accurate and reflect the patient's statements.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and follows the requested structure. However, it fails to fully address the specific sub-question regarding how intensity and frequency changed over time, providing a description of current intensity rather than the temporal trend (which was 'no change')."
