  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer fails significantly by stating that the doctor's explicit summary is not included in the text. In reality, turn D-58 is an explicit summary where the doctor recaps the duration of the cough, fever, headache, lack of sputum, contact history, and medical history. Because the Generated Answer denies the existence of this summary, it provides an incorrect analysis of what was 'recapped' versus what was simply mentioned in the intake.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses almost all specific points from the Gold Answer that were part of the doctor's recap: the lack of sputum production, the specific detail about the brother's cold two weeks ago, the absence of asthma, and the specific goal of wanting to know if she needs medicine or if she can go home to rest. It only mentions the cough and headache, which it attributes to the patient's initial report rather than the doctor's summary.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination regarding the content of the transcript by claiming the summary is missing. Turn D-58 explicitly begins with 'So just to summarize...' and proceeds to recap the clinical findings. Denying this content makes the response unfaithful to the provided source text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is mostly irrelevant because it fails to address the specific constraint of the question: 'In the doctor's summary... what... findings did the doctor recap'. By claiming the summary does not exist, it pivots to a general summary of the intake, which was not the question asked."
