  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two key risk factors: medication non-adherence (missed Keppra dose) and hereditary predisposition (maternal epilepsy). The facts align with the Gold Answer, including the specific quote from P-9 about forgetting medication and P-26 about the mother having epilepsy. The explanation of the relationship between family history and diagnosis is accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer's interpretation.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers both major components from the Gold Answer: hereditary risk (maternal epilepsy) and medication-related risk (missed Keppra dose). However, it lacks some details present in the Gold Answer, such as: (1) the specific context of the daughter's birthday celebration disrupting routine [P-24], (2) the patient's acknowledgment that seizures are normally infrequent [P-9], suggesting good control with medication, and (3) the clinician's specific questioning approach [D-26]. The Generated Answer provides the core information but with less contextual richness.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are verifiable in the transcript. The citations to [P-9], [P-26], and [P-8] are accurate. The answer appropriately references the knowledge graph, which appears to be an additional source not present in the Gold Answer evaluation criteria, but this doesn't constitute hallucination as it's presented as supplementary information. No fabricated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all components of the question: (1) hereditary risk factors, (2) medication-related risk factors, and (3) how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis. The structure clearly delineates these elements with appropriate headers. No off-topic content is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-structured response that correctly identifies both hereditary and medication-related risk factors contributing to the seizure episode. All facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and properly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. The explanation of how family history relates to the epilepsy diagnosis is clear and correct. The answer loses a point on completeness for lacking some contextual details present in the Gold Answer, such as the specific birthday celebration context and the patient's acknowledgment of normally infrequent seizures indicating good medication control. Overall, this is a high-quality response that directly addresses the question with factual accuracy and appropriate focus."
