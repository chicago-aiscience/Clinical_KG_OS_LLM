  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the same triad of symptoms (worsening dry cough [P-1, etc.], fever over 100°F [P-1, P-2], loss/change in taste [P-17]) as the Gold Answer, with similar citations and reasoning from [D-44] (alignment with COVID) and [D-45] (fever indicating infection over asthma). Minor discrepancies include paraphrasing 'aligned' as 'compatible,' overstating 'loss of taste' as definitive (Gold says 'possible'), and adding 'knowledge graph logic' not present in Gold or transcript, but core facts remain fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points from Gold: the specific triad of symptoms with supporting citations (cough worsening over days, precise fever details, taste change); [D-44] explicit COVID alignment prompting test/isolation; [D-45] use of fever to conclude infection vs. asthma. Implicitly addresses acute onset and systemic symptoms (fever, decreased appetite via taste), though misses explicit mention of fatigue; covers 80-99% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable in transcript: symptoms accurately sourced to [P-1], [P-2], [P-5], [P-12], [P-17]; [D-44] paraphrase close to 'symptoms are allowed/aligned with COVID'; [D-45] quote on fever vs. asthma exact. Minor unverifiable: 'loss of taste' presented definitively (parent 'wondered'); significant hallucination of 'knowledge graph logic' not in transcript. Overall mostly grounded with some plausible but unverified additions.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by specifying the exact symptom combination (respiratory complaint, temperature, taste change) and detailing how the doctor collectively used them (esp. fever) for COVID alignment and infectious conclusion via [D-44]/[D-45], with structured breakdown and no off-topic content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, correct, and complete in recapping the Gold Answer's key elements but deducts for faithfulness due to a hallucinated 'knowledge graph logic' reference and minor overstatements."
