  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Compared with the Gold Answer, the Generated Answer is largely inaccurate. It correctly notes that cardiac issues were a concern, but it does not accurately describe how the clinician screened for them (e.g., exertional worsening [D-10], palpitations [D-20], rest pain [D-11]) and instead uses vague, speculative language (“likely used the distinction of triggers”). It also misinterprets [P-20]: the patient was answering about palpitations/heart fluttering, not stating that the chest pain only occurs during anxiety attacks. Thus, its main “ruling out” logic for anxiety is incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer includes 6 screened/rule-out areas: (1) trauma/MSK injury, (2) cardiac disease/angina + palpitations, (3) infectious illness/exposures, (4) asthma, (5) dyspnea/shortness of breath, (6) inherited arrhythmia/sudden death history. The Generated Answer only mentions (part of) cardiac issues and anxiety, and it omits trauma, infection/exposure, asthma, dyspnea, and inherited arrhythmia screening entirely. It also fails to provide the specific clinician questions/lines of inquiry for most of what it does mention.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript and are phrased as speculation (“likely inquiring…”, “likely used the distinction…”). It also introduces an incorrect inference that the chest pain is confirmed to be tied specifically to anxiety attacks, which is not supported by the transcript (the anxiety discussion in [P-20] pertains to palpitations). Some references (e.g., [P-8], [P-20]) exist, but the interpretation is not faithful.",
    "relevance": "The response is generally on-topic (conditions screened/rule-outs), but it does not answer the question as asked because it fails to enumerate the specific conditions the doctor screened for that were ruled out and fails to list the doctor’s actual exclusion questions. The focus on only two items (one misinterpreted) makes it only partially responsive."
