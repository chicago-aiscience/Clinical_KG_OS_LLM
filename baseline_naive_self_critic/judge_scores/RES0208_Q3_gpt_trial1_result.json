  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the constitutional symptoms the doctor cited as evidence of a general infectious process: fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches (matches D-36 and the Gold Answer). However, it misattributes “difficulty breathing” to the general-infection evidence layer rather than clearly treating it as part of the COVID-not-ruled-out respiratory feature set, and it omits shortness of breath/difficulty breathing from the COVID-specific set. Per the Gold Answer, the doctor’s rationale for not ruling out COVID relied on difficulty breathing plus emerging sore throat and cough. By listing only sore throat and cough as the basis for COVID concern, the Generated Answer is materially incomplete and slightly distorts the doctor’s stated reasoning.",
    "completeness": "General infection evidence: fully covered (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches). COVID-not-ruled-out symptoms: partially covered (sore throat, cough) but missing the key additional symptom “difficulty breathing/shortness of breath,” which the Gold Answer highlights as part of the doctor’s COVID concern. It also does not note the Gold Answer’s clarification that loss of taste/smell were not explicitly included in the doctor’s D-36 summary (not strictly required, but part of the Gold’s key nuance). Overall, it captures some but not all key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms mentioned in the Generated Answer (fever, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) are supported by D-36 in the transcript. It does not introduce unsupported symptoms (e.g., it does not incorrectly claim the doctor cited loss of taste/smell in the assessment). The main issue is categorization/omission rather than fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question by separating (1) symptoms cited for general infection and (2) symptoms used to justify that COVID could not yet be ruled out. No major tangents."
