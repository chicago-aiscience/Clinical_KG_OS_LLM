{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the doctor's statements are not available because the transcript only includes patient turns up to [P-27] with no doctor responses, directly contradicting the Gold Answer which accurately cites [D-47] and [D-48] for the summary assessment, plan, and next steps; this is a complete factual error as the full transcript provided includes doctor turns up to [D-48].",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) summary assessment of cough duration, recent worsening, greenish sputum no blood, no constitutional symptoms [D-47]; (2) plan to review story with doctors [D-47]; (3) next steps guided by supervising physician; (4) patient addition and doctor response [D-48]. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead asserting information is missing.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends at [P-27] with no doctor turns (e.g., no [D-28]), but the provided transcript includes full dialogue up to [D-48]; it fabricates 'evidence of missing information' and selectively lists early patient symptoms, none of which verify claims about the end of consultation.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question by stating the information is 'not available' and explaining why, but deviates into irrelevant details like listing patient symptoms (e.g., cough, eczema) from early transcript segments that do not pertain to the doctor's end-of-consultation statements, making it largely off-topic from the specific query about the doctor's plan, assessment, and next steps."
