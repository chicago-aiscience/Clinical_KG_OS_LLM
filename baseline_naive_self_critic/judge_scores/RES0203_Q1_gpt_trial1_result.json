  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three symptom domains present in the transcript (smell change, taste change, and mild dry cough). However, it contains a major factual error about severity: it states the patient had a **complete loss of taste**, whereas the transcript (and Gold Answer) indicate **partial** taste loss (can still taste very salty foods) and partial smell loss (can still smell very strong bad odors). Cough characterization as mild and dry is correct, but it omits other accurate qualifiers (non-productive, no blood, no worsening).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) decreased smell (partial), (2) taste loss (mentioned but severity wrong), (3) mild dry cough.\nKey points missed: (a) smell loss explicitly partial with detail that they can still smell very strong/unpleasant odors; (b) taste loss partial with details—can taste very salty foods but not normal foods, example banana; (c) symptoms present for two days; (d) sensory symptoms and cough were consistent over two days (not intermittent); (e) cough began at same time as sensory symptoms; (f) cough non-productive with no sputum/blood; (g) no identified cough triggers.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in [P-1], but the claim of **complete** taste loss is not faithful to the full transcript because [P-4] clearly indicates residual taste (salty foods). This is a substantive misrepresentation rather than a minor unverifiable detail.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked sensory and respiratory symptoms and attempts to describe degree/severity. However, it fails to include the requested patient-provided details about what they could and could not perceive, limiting its usefulness despite being on-topic."
