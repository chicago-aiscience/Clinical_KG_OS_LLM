  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms the patient reported (chest tightness, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, and phlegm). However, it is factually incorrect regarding the denied symptoms. It claims the transcript does not contain explicit denials for fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating, whereas the transcript clearly shows the patient denying these in turns P-6, P-12, P-13, P-14, and P-15.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover the majority of the 'explicitly denied' symptoms requested in the prompt. While it mentions chest pain and cough, it misses fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating, which were specifically highlighted in the question and are present in both the transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant negative hallucination/omission error by stating that the transcript lacks information that is explicitly present. This makes the answer unfaithful to the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in its structure and directly attempts to address both parts of the question, although it fails to provide the correct information for the second part."
