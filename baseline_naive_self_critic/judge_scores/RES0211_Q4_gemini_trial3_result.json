  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the information regarding screenings for asthma, eczema, allergic reactions, and night sweats is not present in the transcript. These topics are explicitly discussed in turns [D-9], [D-21], [D-29], and [D-32]. Consequently, the answer fails to provide any of the factual information required by the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points regarding the specific screenings requested (asthma, eczema, EpiPen use, night sweats). While it mentions some general symptoms and history, it fails to address the core of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source text by stating that the dialogue is not present. This is a form of 'negative hallucination' where the model denies the existence of provided data.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is mostly irrelevant as it spends the first paragraph explaining why it cannot answer the question (incorrectly) and the second part providing general medical history that was not the focus of the specific question about screenings and narrowing the differential diagnosis."
