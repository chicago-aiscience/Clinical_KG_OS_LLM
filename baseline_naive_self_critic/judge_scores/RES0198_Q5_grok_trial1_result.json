  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies the nephew attending daycare (P-11) as the potential infectious exposure source from social history, noting daycare as a common source of respiratory viruses despite the nephew not being sick (P-12), consistent with viral URI (D-39). The Generated Answer incorrectly states the 'common cold (viral infection)' and COVID-19 as the exposure source from symptoms and physician analysis (D-39), missing the social history entirely. It mentions type 1 diabetes (P-23) but does not accurately relate it to immune function or note the lack of explicit linkage in the transcript as per Gold. Significant factual errors and contradictions on core exposure source.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: nephew/daycare exposure (P-11/P-12), plausibility despite no illness, consistency with URI (D-39), diabetes details (P-23/24/25/26), no explicit immune link, additional patient history. Generated covers: diabetes mention (P-23), vague relation via swab/isolation (D-39). Misses entire exposure source from social history (main point), detailed diabetes info, immune function relation, and notes on transcript limitations. Covers 20-49% (diabetes and partial presentation link).",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims are mostly verifiable: common cold/COVID consideration (D-39), diabetes (P-23), swab/isolation/meds/hydration (D-39). Minor unverifiable stretch: links isolation explicitly to 'patient's chronic condition' (not stated in D-39, which cites pandemic/symptoms). No multiple hallucinations; interpretations plausible but misaligned with question's social history focus. Citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Question focuses on social history exposure source (nephew/daycare) and its relation to presentation with diabetes/immune impact. Generated addresses symptoms/diagnosis (common cold/COVID) and diabetes in context of management/swab/isolation, but ignores social history exposure and immune function specifics, including off-topic symptom management details. Partially relevant with significant off-topic content."
