  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major facts from the Gold Answer: the working diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), both supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold), the COVID swab test with 48-hour turnaround, and the isolation guidance with follow-up instructions from public health. The structure and content align well with the Gold Answer, with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) the stated diagnosis of 'most likely a viral infection like the common cold,' (2) both supportive care recommendations (hydration and OTC medications like Tylenol Cold), (3) the diagnostic COVID swab test ordered for today with 48-hour results, and (4) the public health guidance to isolate at home and await further instructions. The only minor omission is the explicit mention that symptoms can take 'a few weeks' to resolve, which was included in the Gold Answer but not prominently featured in the Generated Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in [D-39]. The diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance are all accurately cited and grounded in the doctor's statement. No hallucinated information is present, and all citations point to the correct source.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by systematically presenting the doctor's management plan with clear organization under diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic testing, and public health guidance headings. All content is relevant to the question asked, with no off-topic or tangential information."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-organized description of the doctor's management plan that aligns closely with the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the diagnosis, both supportive care recommendations, the diagnostic test, and public health guidance, all grounded in the transcript. The only minor gap is the omission of the explicit timeframe for symptom resolution ('a few weeks'), which slightly affects completeness. Otherwise, the response is factually correct, faithful to the source, and highly relevant."
