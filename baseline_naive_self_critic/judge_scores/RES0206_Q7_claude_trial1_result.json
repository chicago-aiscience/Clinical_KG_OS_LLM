  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately represents the facts from the transcript. It correctly identifies the 3-day timeline, symptom progression (increased cough, green-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, worsening dyspnea), baseline state as 'manageable,' worsening trend, and this being the worst exacerbation. All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript citations.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the major points but misses some key details from the Gold Answer: (1) specific baseline rescue inhaler use frequency (once every two weeks), (2) specific functional impacts like dog walking becoming 'trickier' vs maintaining ability to walk to appointment, (3) possible fever the night before suggesting ongoing escalation, (4) explicit quote that symptoms 'definitely haven't gotten better,' (5) specific ED visit history (twice in 3 years, never hospitalized overnight). These omissions reduce completeness despite covering core concepts.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The Generated Answer appropriately references specific patient statements [P-1], [P-3] and doctor statements [D-43]. No hallucinated content is present. The knowledge graph reference is mentioned but not elaborated inappropriately. All clinical interpretations (COPD exacerbation, infection) are grounded in the doctor's assessment.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three components of the question: (1) symptom evolution from baseline to acute presentation, (2) improvement vs worsening trajectory, and (3) severity comparison to prior exacerbations. The structure mirrors the question's organization. No irrelevant tangents are present. The content stays focused on the clinical trajectory."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides a factually accurate and well-grounded response that directly addresses all aspects of the question. It correctly identifies the symptom evolution, worsening trajectory, and comparative severity. However, it lacks several specific details present in the Gold Answer, including baseline rescue inhaler frequency, functional capacity details, fever timing, explicit worsening quotes, and complete ED visit history. Despite these omissions, the core clinical narrative is correctly captured with appropriate transcript citations and no fabricated content."
