  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly shows the doctor systematically explored multiple potential exposure sources. Specifically, at [D-45] the doctor asks 'where do you currently live?' and the patient responds living in an apartment alone [P-45]. At [D-46] the doctor asks about environmental triggers. At [D-47] the doctor asks about contact with sick people. At [D-48] the doctor asks where the patient works. At [D-49] the doctor asks about recent travel. At [D-50] the doctor asks if anyone at work has been sick. The Generated Answer incorrectly states the doctor 'did not systematically explore' these areas.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) living situation inquiry and response, (2) environmental exposure questions, (3) sick contact questions, (4) workplace identification, (5) specific follow-up about sick coworkers, (6) travel history inquiry, and (7) substance use screening. The Generated Answer provides 0% coverage of the actual exposure source exploration that occurred.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not faithful to the transcript. It directly contradicts what is documented in the transcript by claiming exploration did not occur when multiple exchanges clearly show systematic inquiry into living situation [D-45], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48], travel [D-49], and workplace illness [D-50]. This represents significant hallucination of a negative finding.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses whether exposure sources were explored, which is relevant to the question. However, it provides an incorrect answer to the question, stating no exploration occurred when the question specifically asks what sources were explored. This makes it partially relevant but fundamentally unhelpful."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is severely flawed across all dimensions. It incorrectly claims the doctor did not systematically explore potential infection sources, when the transcript clearly documents inquiries about living situation [D-45][P-45], environmental triggers [D-46][P-46], sick contacts [D-47][P-47], workplace [D-48][P-48], travel [D-49][P-49], and workplace illness [D-50][P-50]. This represents a fundamental misreading of the transcript and contradicts documented evidence. The answer provides no coverage of the actual exposure source exploration that occurred and fabricates a negative finding."
