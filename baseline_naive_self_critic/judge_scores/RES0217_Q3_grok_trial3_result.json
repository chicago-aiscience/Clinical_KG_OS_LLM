  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on exposure history (hiking Friday, gardening Saturday), tick attachment duration (>72 hours [D-6]), and prior history (10-year-old tick bite with bullseye rash requiring antibiotics [P-3]). It correctly notes the despite clauses (not deer tick-like [P-5], no current rash [P-6]). However, geographic risk assessment is inaccurately represented: Gold specifies Strathroy along creek [P-12] and doctor's map check deeming it 'concerning' [D-13]; Generated uses general tick habitats/long grass consistent with activities [D-18], missing specifics. Conclusion infers 'known susceptibility' from prior history (plausible but not explicit) and misattributes 'safer' quote to [D-6] (actual [D-18]). Minor discrepancies, core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: exposure history [P-1] (covered), duration >72h [D-6] (covered), geographic risk (Strathroy/creek [P-12], map/'concerning' [D-13]) (missed, substituted general habitats), prior history [P-3] (covered), despite not deer tick/no rash (covered), patient's comment all ticks carriers [P-5] (missed), send tick to lab [D-6] (not explicit), 'safer' prophylaxis [D-18] (covered). Covers ~70% of key points (strong on 3/4 main factors, misses/misrepresents geo and extras).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable: exposure [P-1], duration [D-6], habitats/geo advice [D-18], prior [P-3], despite [P-5/P-6], prophylaxis rationale [D-6/D-18]. 'Known susceptibility via previous target rash occurrences' inferred from prior event (plausible, minor pluralization error as one occurrence), no major hallucinations; citations accurate except minor quote source.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly focused on question's specified combination (exposure, duration, geo risk, prior history) with bullet structure, directly addresses despite clauses (not deer tick, no rash), no tangents."
