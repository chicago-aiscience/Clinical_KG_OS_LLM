  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the management plan stated in [D-52]: COVID swab ordered, 14-day isolation, public health contact tracing if positive, and supportive care measures (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). No statements contradict the Gold Answer. The only notable omission is the stated test result turnaround time (24–48 hours), but nothing included is factually wrong versus the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: COVID-19 swab; 14-day isolation; contact tracing if positive; supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches); acknowledgement it could be another viral illness/supportive either way. Missed compared with Gold: expected test result timeframe (24–48 hours) and the explicit note that no prescription medications were ordered beyond supportive measures.",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is directly supported by [D-52]. However, the references to a “Knowledge Graph” confirming procedures are not in the transcript and are therefore unverifiable additions (though they do not materially change the clinical plan).",
    "relevance": "The response is focused on exactly what was asked: test ordered, isolation duration, when contact tracing happens, and supportive care recommendations. The only minor distraction is the unnecessary “Knowledge Graph” commentary, but it does not derail the answer."
