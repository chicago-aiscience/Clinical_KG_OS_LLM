  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine (an OTC antihistamine) and other over-the-counter medications for seasonal allergies, and accurately states no prescribed medications, aligning with the Gold Answer's core facts from [P-36], [P-46], [P-47]. Minor discrepancies include attributing statements to 'the patient' instead of the mother (proxy speaker) and referencing a non-existent 'knowledge graph [KG]' for allergies (though allergies are verifiable in [P-35]). No major factual errors or contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) No medications/treatments for current respiratory episodes (resolve on own, [P-33],[P-34]); (2) Occasional OTC Reactine/antihistamines for seasonal allergies ([P-35],[P-36]); (3) No prescribed medications ([P-36],[P-46],[P-47]); (4) Past viral infections required no antibiotics ([P-16]). Generated covers (2) and (3) fully, but misses (1) entirely and (4) completely, achieving about 50% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine, OTC stuff, no prescribed meds are directly verifiable in [P-36]; seasonal allergies grounded in [P-35]. However, 'patient explicitly stated' misattributes to child instead of mother (P as proxy); references to 'knowledge graph [KG]' and its associations are not in transcript, introducing hallucination. Mostly grounded with some unverifiable extras.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists medications/treatments (Reactine/OTC for allergies) and addresses prescribed medications (none), perfectly matching the question's focus on current/other conditions and prescribed management, with no off-topic content."
