  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies 'Anxiety Attacks' as a condition that was ruled out. In reality, the transcript and Gold Answer suggest anxiety was a primary suspect for the symptoms, whereas conditions like Asthma, Infections, and Traumatic injuries were the ones effectively ruled out. Additionally, it fails to distinguish between general cardiac issues and the specific inherited arrhythmia syndromes mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers only 2 conditions (Cardiac issues and Anxiety), whereas the Gold Answer identifies 6 distinct categories (Traumatic injury, Cardiac disease/Angina, Infectious illness, Asthma, Primary dyspnea, and Inherited arrhythmia syndromes). It misses roughly 70% of the key points regarding conditions like asthma, fever/infection, and physical injury.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer uses citations from the transcript, but its interpretation of 'ruling out' anxiety is logically inconsistent with the text. The patient's admission that palpitations occur during anxiety attacks actually supports anxiety as a potential cause rather than excluding it.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses the prompt's request for conditions, inquiries, and results, though the scope of its response is very limited compared to the provided source material."
