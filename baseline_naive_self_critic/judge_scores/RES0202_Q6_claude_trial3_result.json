  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major clinical decisions from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies the COVID swab, 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation including from sister, possibility of false negatives, alternative diagnosis of 'another viral illness', and all five specific warning signs (high temperature, neurological symptoms/seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells). The citations [D-44, D-45] match the Gold Answer's references.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key elements: (1) COVID swab ordered, (2) 24-48 hour turnaround, (3) 14-day isolation including from sister, (4) false negative acknowledgment, (5) alternative diagnosis if negative, (6) specific warning signs with examples, and (7) assessment as infection. The only minor omission is the Gold Answer's note about asthma being considered if only respiratory symptoms without fever were present [D-45], though this contextual detail is less central to the management plan.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The COVID swab order [D-44], 24-48 hour timeframe [D-44], 14-day isolation [D-44], false negative possibility [D-44], alternative viral illness [D-44], and all warning signs [D-44] are explicitly stated in the source material. No hallucinated content detected.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all components of the question: diagnostic test with turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis, false negative possibility, and warning signs with examples. The organization clearly maps to each element requested. No irrelevant information included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and comprehensive summary of the clinical assessment and management plan, correctly capturing the COVID swab with 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation recommendation, acknowledgment of false negatives, alternative viral diagnosis consideration, and all five specific warning signs for ER visit. All information is faithfully grounded in the transcript with proper citations. The only minor gap is the omission of the contextual note about asthma being considered in non-febrile respiratory presentations, which slightly reduces completeness but does not affect the core management plan accuracy."
