  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer details specific evidence like absent symptoms (no cough [P-4], no sore throat/SOB/fever/chills [P-7], no post-nasal drip [P-6]), clear discharge [P-5], 1-week constant duration [P-2,P-8], progression [P-3], no allergy exposures/allergies/prior episodes [P-22,P-28,P-9], no bacterial signs (fever/headache [P-7,P-14]), daycare exposure [P-11]. Generated correctly identifies stuffy/runny nose [P-1,P-3], 1-week duration [P-1,P-2], doctor's viral conclusion [D-39], common cold duration [D-39], and vaguely notes allergies less likely. Minor discrepancy: emphasizes 'on and off' [P-1] without noting later 'constant' [P-8] as in Gold. No contradictions or factual errors, core facts match where stated.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: doctor's conclusion [D-39] (yes), symptom type nasal congestion/rhinorrhea (partial, stuffy/runny), duration 1 week (yes). Missed: specific absent features (cough [P-4], systemic [P-7], post-nasal [P-6]), discharge quality clear/no color [P-5], constant symptoms [P-8], progression [P-3], against allergic (exposures [P-22], no allergies [P-28], no recent priors [P-9]), against bacterial (no fever [P-7], no headache [P-14], clear discharge), exposure (nephew/daycare [P-11,P-12]). Covers ~25% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript: stuffy/runny nose [P-1,P-3], week duration [P-1,P-2], on/off [P-1], constant implied but not contradicted, viral/common cold [D-39], Tylenol cold/COVID [D-39]. 'Knowledge graph' not in provided input (minor unverifiable, possibly assumed). Interpretation of allergies less likely plausible from questions [D-22,D-28] and no positives, no hallucination of facts. Citations accurate.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses evidence for viral vs allergic/bacterial via symptom characteristics (type, duration partial) and doctor's correlation [D-39]. Minor tangents: COVID swab/management [D-39], OTC treatment not core evidence. Vague on differential but focused on question without major off-topic content."
