  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Generated Answer correctly identifies loss of taste (P-4), overall achiness (P-20), subjective fever (P-4), and decreased appetite (P-2, P-4), all matching Gold. However, it misattributes laborious breathing (P-3) and dry throat feeling (P-8, referring to cough) as upper respiratory beyond chief complaints, which overlaps with excluded shortness of breath. It mangles the taste quote slightly but intent is accurate. Misses smell loss (P-6), cough (P-7/8), sore throat (P-9), weakness (P-2), headaches (P-11-13). Some factual errors in categorization and omissions lead to score of 3.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: loss of taste, overall achy/muscle aches, subjective fever, decreased appetite (4 points). Missed: diminished smell, early dry cough, mild sore throat, denial of runny nose/congestion, general weakness, mild headaches (6 points). Covers ~40% of key points, score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: taste (P-4), breathing (P-3), dry feeling (P-8), achy (P-20), hot/warm (P-4), appetite (P-2/P-4). Minor quote mangling on taste but no hallucination or fabrication, fully grounded, score 5.",
    "relevance": "Answer directly structures response by the exact categories in the question (sensory, upper respiratory, musculoskeletal, constitutional), lists symptoms beyond chief complaints with citations, no off-topic content despite some misattribution, perfectly focused, score 5."
