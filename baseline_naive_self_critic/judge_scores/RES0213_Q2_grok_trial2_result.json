  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the three OTC remedies for chest pain (Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer) and their ineffectiveness, matching the Gold Answer and transcript [P-6]. However, it inaccurately states that the patient 'did not report taking any specific over-the-counter medications or supplements for routine maintenance,' omitting the daily multivitamin explicitly reported in [P-25] and emphasized in Gold as the only ongoing supplement. It miscategorizes smoking (a habit, not an OTC med/supplement) as part of routine medication/supplement use. This introduces significant factual discrepancies on the routine aspect.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Tylenol, Advil, Alka-Seltzer for pain; (2) ineffective; (3) daily multivitamin as routine supplement; (4) no prescription meds; (5) stress management via reading/running; (6) trying to quit smoking, reduced intake. Generated covers (1) fully, (2) fully, (6) partially; misses (3), (4), (5) entirely. Covers approximately 50% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Pain relief claims fully verifiable in [P-6]. Smoking verifiable in [P-13, P-14, P-18]. However, claim of no routine OTC meds/supplements is not grounded and contradicts [P-25] where patient reports taking a multivitamin ('that's it'). This represents hallucination by omission and false negation. Minor additional framing of smoking as routine 'medication/supplement' is ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses OTC meds/supps for pain and routine, with effectiveness; structured response focused on question. Minor irrelevance in emphasizing smoking (lifestyle, not med/supplement) instead of actual routine supplement, but no major off-topic content."
