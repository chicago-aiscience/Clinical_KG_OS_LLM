  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains severe factual errors. It claims 'no negative findings' were documented and that 'the doctor did not screen for these specific symptoms,' which directly contradicts the transcript. The doctor explicitly asked about and confirmed the absence of fever [D-10, P-10], difficulty breathing [D-11, P-11], headaches [D-12, P-12], sore throat [D-13, P-13], chills/night sweats [D-14, P-14], muscle aches [D-15, P-15], and chest pain [D-22, P-22]. The Generated Answer's core claim is factually incorrect.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover the key points from the Gold Answer. It omits all the pertinent negative findings that were systematically screened: fever, dyspnea, headaches, sore throat, chills, night sweats, muscle aches, weakness, chest pain, sputum production, and environmental triggers. It also omits the medical history negatives (chronic conditions, medications, surgeries, allergies, family history). Coverage is essentially 0% of the Gold Answer's key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript. It states the doctor 'did not screen' for fever, dyspnea, and sore throat when the transcript clearly shows these were asked about in D-10 through D-22. This represents hallucination through omission and misrepresentation of what occurred in the consultation. The claim that 'there were no negative findings documented' is directly contradicted by multiple exchanges in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question. The question specifically asks for negative findings from the review of systems and how their absence informed the clinical picture. The Generated Answer incorrectly claims no such screening occurred and instead discusses only positive findings. This is entirely off-topic from what was requested."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly claims that no systematic screening for symptoms occurred and that no negative findings were documented, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor asked about and confirmed the absence of fever, dyspnea, sore throat, headaches, chills, muscle aches, chest pain, and other symptoms across multiple exchanges (D-10 through D-22). This represents a complete misreading of the source material and fails to address the question, which specifically requested the negative findings and their clinical significance. The answer provides 0% coverage of the Gold Answer's content and contradicts verifiable facts in the transcript."
