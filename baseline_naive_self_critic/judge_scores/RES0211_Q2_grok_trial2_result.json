  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Claritin as carried 'just in case' for seasonal allergies (not currently taken) with accurate citations [P-16, P-25], and accurately describes past allergy shots from the allergist with frequency details [P-16, P-20]. However, it completely omits the second current medication, Deyo (oral contraceptive pill taken regularly for three months [P-25-P-28]), which the Gold Answer lists as one of two current medications, and misses details like no medication allergies [P-16], no EpiPen [P-21], and allergy severity context [P-18, P-21]. This constitutes a significant factual omission/contradiction regarding current medications.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: Claritin (carrying, not taking, indication, citations), allergy shots (name, indication, frequency/dosing details, citations). Key points missed: Deyo birth control (name, indication as oral contraceptive for three months, regular taking, distinction from IUD), no medication allergies, no EpiPen, and confirmation allergies are seasonal without anaphylaxis. Covers approximately 50-60% of key points, primarily missing one entire current medication and supplementary details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: Claritin carrying/usage [P-25], allergies [P-16], shots frequency [P-20], with accurate citations. No hallucinations or unverifiable details introduced; content is fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by structuring responses around current medications carried (Claritin) and past allergist treatments (allergy shots), including names, indications, and dosing/frequency details where mentioned, with no off-topic content."
