  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the three symptoms (cough, fever, and loss of taste) and correctly explains the doctor's logic for diagnosing an infectious process. It correctly highlights that the presence of fever was the key differentiator between a potential asthma diagnosis and an infection, which is consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all key points found in the Gold Answer, including the specific symptom triad, the specific temperatures mentioned, the loss of interest in breakfast as an indicator of taste loss, and the doctor's specific reasoning from D-44 and D-45.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is well-grounded in the transcript with accurate citations. However, it includes the phrase 'knowledge graph logic' which is an external conceptual framework not mentioned in the transcript or Gold Answer, representing a minor hallucination/external interpretation of the doctor's mental process.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question: identifying the symptom combination and explaining the collective use of these findings for the diagnosis."
