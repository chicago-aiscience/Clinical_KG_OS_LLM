    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the timeline of the dry cough starting Wednesday, worsening Thursday, and the emergence of fever and appetite issues on Friday. It correctly cites the temperature as being over 100.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points but omits a few details found in the gold answer, such as the specific fever values mentioned by the parent (100.1 or 101°F), the 'mild runny nose' mentioned in [P-16], and the specific mention of fatigue as a symptom on Friday [P-25] (it only lists fatigue/tiredness on Thursday). it also misses the mother's correction of the timeline from 5 to 3 days [P-4].",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript, with all claims supported by the provided text. The citations [P-1] and [P-17] are accurate.",
