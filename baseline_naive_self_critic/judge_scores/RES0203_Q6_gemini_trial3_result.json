  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the doctor's assessment (suspected COVID-19), the diagnostic test (swab), and the isolation instructions. However, it incorrectly states that there is no mention of a supervising physician in the transcript, which contradicts the source text at [D-40] ('we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today').",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two specific points requested in the prompt: the mention of 'additional tests' ('there might be a couple other tests we want to do' [D-40]) and the details of the consultation with the supervising physician.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a false claim about the transcript content by stating the plan to consult a supervising physician is missing. This is a failure of grounding as the information is explicitly present in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is well-structured and directly attempts to address every part of the multi-part question, even though it fails to find some of the information."
