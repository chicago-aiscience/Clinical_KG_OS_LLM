  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient's current statin therapy (citing P-15), the proposed prophylactic antibiotics (citing D-6), and the historical antibiotics for a past tick bite (citing P-3). All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript without errors or contradictions, though it omits some contextual details like allergies and cholesterol management.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: current statin [P-15]; past antibiotics for tick bite [P-3]; new prophylactic antibiotics proposed [D-6, with some context]. Missed or partially covered: cholesterol management context [P-14]; no allergies [P-16,P-17]; full details on past bite (10 years, bullseye rash); reiterations of prophylaxis [D-13,D-18]; no specific antibiotic details; physician consultation [D-13,D-22]; environmental insecticide suggestion [D-18]. Covers core medications/treatments (approx. 80-90%) but misses supportive details.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: statin at P-15; prophylactic antibiotics at D-6; past antibiotics/target rash at P-3. Citations accurate. No hallucinations, though minor reference to 'knowledge graph' is extraneous but not fabricating content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by listing discussed medications (statin) and treatments (prophylactic antibiotics, historical antibiotics), perfectly focused on the query without off-topic content."
