  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer misunderstands the question entirely. The question specifically asks about screening for INFECTIOUS causes (including COVID-19) with symptoms like recent colds, fevers, loss of taste/smell, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, and exposure history regarding sick contacts and travel. Instead, the Generated Answer discusses environmental triggers (cold weather, pollen, pets, exercise) which are asthma triggers, not infectious screening. It also incorrectly identifies 'increased bronchodilator usage' as a diagnostic test when the Gold Answer correctly identifies a COVID swab as the planned test. This is a fundamental misinterpretation of the clinical scenario.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It completely misses: (1) all infectious symptom screening (colds, fever, loss of taste/smell, nausea, vomiting, belly pain), (2) all exposure history questions (sick contacts at home, sick contacts outside home, recent travel), (3) the rationale for infectious screening, and (4) the COVID swab as the planned diagnostic test. Instead, it discusses entirely different content about asthma triggers.",
    "faithfulness": "While the Generated Answer does reference actual statements from the transcript (cold weather, pollen, pets, exercise), it misapplies them to answer a question they don't address. The transcript clearly shows infectious screening in D-21 through D-28, but the Generated Answer ignores this entirely. The claim that 'increased bronchodilator usage' was planned as a diagnostic test is a misinterpretation - this was discussed as current management, not a planned test. The COVID swab mentioned in D-29 is completely omitted.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant to the question asked. The question specifically requests information about screening for INFECTIOUS causes and COVID-19, but the answer discusses asthma triggers and environmental factors. Only the mention of 'no pets' tangentially relates to exposure history, but even this misses the point about infectious exposure. The answer fails to address the core question about infectious disease screening."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fundamentally misunderstands the question, providing information about asthma triggers instead of infectious disease screening. It omits all key infectious symptoms screened (fevers, loss of taste/smell, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, recent colds), all exposure history questions (sick contacts, travel), and incorrectly identifies the planned diagnostic test. While some referenced content is from the transcript, it's applied to the wrong clinical context, making the answer largely irrelevant and incorrect."
