  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies several screened-and-absent Lyme features (no erythema migrans rash, no joint pain, no fever/feeling ill) and correctly lists proposed testing (physical exam, tick ID, serologic blood work). However, it contains a factual/misattribution error: it claims the patient said they were \"just for my cholesterol\" to imply no systemic illness, but that statement [P-14] was in response to what they see their doctor for, not how they were feeling. It also omits that headache was specifically screened and denied, which is part of the Gold Answer’s set of assessed absent features.",
    "completeness": "Covered: absence of bullseye rash; absence of joint pain; absence of fever/illness; proposed physical exam; tick sent for species identification; blood work/serology.\nMissed: headache screening/denial; explicit confirmation she felt well otherwise; confirmation of no other bites; plan to consult supervising physician (not a test, but part of evaluation plan in Gold). Overall, the key testing items are included but several assessed clinical features are missing.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate references (rash [D-6], joint pain [D-7], fever [D-8], proposed tests [D-18]). However, the inference/misattribution using [P-14] (cholesterol) as evidence of no systemic symptoms is not supported by the transcript context. Mention of a \"knowledge graph\" is not grounded in the transcript. These reduce faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the asked items (absent clinical features and proposed diagnostic tests). Minor irrelevant framing (\"knowledge graph\") and some unnecessary elaboration, but it remains mostly on-topic."
