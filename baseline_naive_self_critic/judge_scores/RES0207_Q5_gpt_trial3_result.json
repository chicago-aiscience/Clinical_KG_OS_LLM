  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the two main factors in the Gold Answer: (1) medication non-adherence (patient forgot their seizure medication) and (2) hereditary predisposition (epilepsy runs in the family; mother affected). It also correctly links the maternal history to genetic predisposition underlying the patient’s epilepsy diagnosis. No substantive factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) hereditary predisposition with explicit maternal history (“My mom had it”); (2) medication non-adherence as a precipitant; (3) connection of family history to the patient’s epilepsy diagnosis.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: (a) the specific anti-seizure medication name (Keppra); (b) the specific reason for missing the dose (routine disrupted by daughter’s birthday/meal timing); (c) the patient’s statement that seizures are usually infrequent/well-controlled when adherent. Overall, it captures the core but omits several supporting details.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are directly supported by the transcript (missed medication [P-9], family history/mother [P-26], patient has epilepsy [P-8]). However, repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and its asserted links are not present in the transcript and therefore are not verifiable from the provided source. These are minor additions that don’t change the clinical meaning but reduce strict groundedness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on hereditary and medication-related risk factors for the seizure and explains how family history relates to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis, which directly answers the question with minimal extraneous content."
