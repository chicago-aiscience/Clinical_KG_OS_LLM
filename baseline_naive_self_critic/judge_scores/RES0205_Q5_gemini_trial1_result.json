  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error regarding the patient's activity during their illness. It claims that working in a healthcare environment 'prevented the necessary recovery time,' whereas the transcript [P-36] explicitly states the patient has been at home for the past two weeks waiting to get better. Additionally, it attributes the cough to hay fever rather than the post-viral pattern identified in the Gold Answer. It also references a 'Knowledge Graph' which does not exist in the provided context.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer addresses the three specific points requested (acid reflux, hay fever, and occupation). However, it misses the Gold Answer's nuanced points: that the reflux is unmedicated (suggesting it may not be fully controlled), that hay fever is a history of sensitivity rather than the active cause, and the context of the patient's anxiety and post-viral symptom pattern.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a source ('Knowledge Graph') and contradicts the transcript [P-36] regarding the patient being at home. It speculates that hay fever is the 'remaining factor driving the cough' despite the transcript describing a clear progression from flu-like symptoms to a dry cough, which the Gold Answer correctly identifies as a post-viral pattern.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant in structure, as it directly organizes its response around the three factors mentioned in the prompt."
