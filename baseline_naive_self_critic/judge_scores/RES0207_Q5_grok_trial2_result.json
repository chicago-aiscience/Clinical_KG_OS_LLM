  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the two main risk factors (hereditary family history of epilepsy in mother [P-26] and medication non-adherence [P-9]) matching the Gold Answer, and correctly links family history to the patient's epilepsy diagnosis [P-8], with no factual contradictions on transcript-derived information; however, it introduces a 'knowledge graph' not present in the Gold Answer or transcript, but this does not alter core facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: medication non-adherence ('forgot med' [P-9]), hereditary risk ('epilepsy runs in family, mom had it' [P-26]), relation to diagnosis (genetic predisposition linking patient's epilepsy [P-8] to family history). Missed: specific medication name (Keppra [P-23]), detailed reason for missing dose (daughter's birthday [P-24]), clinician's family history question [D-26], infrequent seizures when adherent [P-9], well-controlled epilepsy, and explicit combination of factors preceding seizure. Covers ~60-70% of Gold Answer's detailed points.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript claims are verifiable: forgot med [P-9], family history [P-26], patient's epilepsy [P-8], citations accurate. However, multiple references to 'knowledge graph' (identifying missed med as precipitant, linking family history to diagnosis, specific ontology like [HAS_FAMILY_HISTORY_OF]) are not in transcript, representing hallucinated external structure/content.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses hereditary/medication risks for seizure and family history's relation to epilepsy diagnosis with structured sections; knowledge graph mentions are supplementary but on-topic."
