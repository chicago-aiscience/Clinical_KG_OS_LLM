  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It claims the transcript does not specify if the cough is productive or non-productive, when in fact D-5 asks 'has it you said it was a dry cough?' and P-5 confirms 'Yeah, that's right.' Additionally, D-6 explicitly asks about bringing up 'gunk' and P-6 denies it ('No, no, nothing like that'), confirming non-productive cough. The answer also incorrectly states that nasal discharge is not reported, when P-11 clearly says 'Oh yes, I have had that for the past couple of days as well' and P-12 describes it as 'pretty clear.' These are major omissions of directly stated information.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is severely incomplete. It only partially addresses the cough (missing the dry/non-productive confirmation despite it being in the transcript) and completely fails to mention the runny nose symptom. The Gold Answer covers: (1) cough duration (4-5 days), (2) explicitly non-productive nature with supporting quotes, (3) progression (stayed the same), (4) runny nose for couple days, (5) clear nasal discharge, (6) patient's statement about never having such symptoms before, and (7) pertinent negatives. The Generated Answer covers less than 30% of these key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes false claims that directly contradict the transcript. Stating the 'transcript does not specify' the cough nature when it explicitly does (D-5, P-5, D-6, P-6) is a misrepresentation. Similarly, claiming nasal discharge 'is not reported' when it clearly is (D-11, P-11, D-12, P-12) represents a failure to accurately reflect the source material. While it doesn't hallucinate new information, it incorrectly denies information that exists in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer attempts to address the question about respiratory symptoms and their characteristics, but does so incompletely. It focuses only on the cough and fails to address the nasal discharge symptom entirely, despite the question explicitly asking about 'specific respiratory symptoms' (plural) and 'the appearance of the nasal discharge.' The partial relevance to only one of two symptoms significantly limits its utility."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates poor performance across all evaluation dimensions. It contains major factual errors by claiming information is not in the transcript when it explicitly is present (cough nature and nasal discharge). It misses approximately 70% of key clinical details including the second respiratory symptom (runny nose), the explicit confirmation of non-productive cough, symptom progression, and discharge characteristics. While it attempts to answer the question and doesn't fabricate information, it fundamentally misrepresents the source material by denying the existence of clearly documented symptoms and characteristics."
