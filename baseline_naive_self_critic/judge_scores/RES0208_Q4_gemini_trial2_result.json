  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a severe factual error by claiming that the transcript does not contain the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea. These questions are explicitly present in turns [D-10], [D-15], [D-16], and [D-17]. Furthermore, it incorrectly categorizes 'Taste' as a denied symptom (the patient reported a loss of taste as a positive finding) and 'Cough' as denied (the patient said it might be starting/dry).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several pertinent negatives listed in the Gold Answer, including changes in vision/hearing, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and numbness/tingling. It only addresses the symptoms mentioned as examples in the prompt's parenthetical.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer fails significantly on faithfulness by hallucinating that the specific symptoms mentioned in the prompt were not in the transcript, when they are clearly visible in the source text provided.",
    "relevance": "While the first half of the answer is incorrect regarding the transcript's content, the second half (Differentiation of Working Diagnosis) correctly explains the clinical logic for why those absences are important, which directly addresses the second part of the question."
