  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately states the medication regimen as multivitamins only [P-40], matching Gold. Allergy to penicillin [P-37] and rash reaction [P-38] are exact matches to Gold. No factual errors or contradictions with Gold; the 'knowledge graph' mention is extraneous but does not alter facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: meds = multivitamins only [P-40]; pre-diabetic monitoring but no Rx meds [P-33]; no HTN [P-34]/cholesterol [P-35]; penicillin allergy [P-37]; rash [P-38]; no breathing trouble [P-39]. Generated covers meds, allergy, rash (core ~80%), misses pre-diabetic context, denials of other conditions, no breathing issues.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims (multivitamins [P-40], penicillin [P-37], rash [P-38]) directly verifiable in transcript. 'Knowledge graph' reference is not in transcript, introducing minor unverifiable/hallucinated detail, but core content grounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly structures response around the three-part question (regimen, allergy, reaction) with bullet points, no off-topic content beyond minor extraneous confirmation."
