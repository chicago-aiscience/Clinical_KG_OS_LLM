  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the Gold Answer's clinical information perfectly. All medical recommendations and the diagnostic test identified align with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers nearly all key points, including the swab, the 14-day isolation period, the condition for contact tracing, and the specific supportive care measures (hydration, food, sleep, Tylenol/NSAIDs). It misses the specific detail regarding the 24-48 hour turnaround time for results mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is grounded in the transcript (D-52). However, it includes extraneous meta-commentary regarding a 'Knowledge Graph' which is not present in the source text or the Gold Answer, suggesting a slight hallucination of the source context even if the medical facts remain grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured to address each specific part of the user's multi-part question."
