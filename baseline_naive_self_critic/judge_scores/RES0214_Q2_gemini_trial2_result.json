  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns perfectly with the gold answer regarding the core facts: multivitamins as the only medication, penicillin as the allergy, and a rash as the reaction.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the primary requirements of the question. However, it misses some secondary details present in the Gold Answer, such as the absence of prescription medications for pre-diabetes, the denial of blood pressure or cholesterol medications, and the specific negative finding regarding respiratory distress during allergic reactions (no trouble breathing).",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript with accurate citations ([P-40], [P-37], [P-38]). The parenthetical note about a knowledge graph is external but does not constitute a hallucination of transcript content.",
