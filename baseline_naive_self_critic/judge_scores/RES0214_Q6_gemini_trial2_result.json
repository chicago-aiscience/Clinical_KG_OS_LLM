  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the COVID-19 swab and the isolation measures. However, it incorrectly states that the 'immediate next step' is the swab, whereas the transcript (D-52) explicitly states that the immediate next step is a physical examination. The rest of the clinical reasoning regarding influenza is factually consistent with the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Gold Answer identifies four key components: 1) COVID swab, 2) isolation for both patient and husband, 3) the physical exam as the next immediate step, and 4) the consultation with the supervising doctor. The Generated Answer covers the first two but completely omits the physical exam and the supervisor consultation, which were specifically requested as part of 'next steps before concluding'. This represents roughly 50% coverage of the key points in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are grounded in the transcript. The mention of ruling out influenza is found in D-53/D-54, and the isolation instructions are clearly stated. No hallucinations were detected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, focusing specifically on the doctor's management plan, tests, and precautions. It addresses the prompt directly, though it focuses more on the diagnostic strategy than the logistical next steps mentioned in the encounter."
