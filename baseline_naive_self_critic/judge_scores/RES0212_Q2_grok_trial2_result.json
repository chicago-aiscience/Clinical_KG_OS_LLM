  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately describes the patient's eczema treatments (current regular moisturizing cream and past prescription cream from family doctor), which aligns with the Gold Answer and transcript [P-22, P-23]. However, it has minor interpretive additions like 'stronger medicated moisturizer' and 'over-the-counter regular cream' (plausible but not explicitly stated), and a slight citation inaccuracy (P-22 mentions eczema history, not severity). Critically, it omits the explicit statement of no current medications [P-29], but does not contradict any facts. Overall, minor discrepancies with core eczema facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) no current medications [P-29]; (2) eczema history with current moisturizing creams [P-22, P-23]; (3) past prescription cream for bad eczema [P-23]; (4) no drug allergies [P-28]; (5) possible cat allergy, no meds [P-27]; (6) condoms, no hormonal BC [P-45]; (7) marijuana and alcohol use [P-36-37,41-42]; (8) no OTC cough remedies etc. Generated covers only (2) and (3) partially (~25% coverage), missing all others.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims about eczema are grounded in transcript [P-23]; citations mostly accurate (minor offset on P-22). Interpretations like 'medicated moisturizer' and 'over-the-counter' are plausible inferences from context but not verbatim, no major hallucinations or unverifiable facts.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses eczema treatments but frames response narrowly 'regarding her eczema,' ignoring broader question on all medications/treatments (e.g., no meds overall, substances, contraception), resulting in partial relevance with significant omissions."
