  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly states the cough duration as approximately one month, whereas the transcript and gold answer confirm it has been present for three months (the one-month timeframe refers specifically to the cough waking her up at night). It correctly identifies the greenish sputum and chest pain when coughing. However, it fails to name any of the symptoms the patient denied, providing only turn references.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details found in the gold answer, including the initial dry nature of the cough, the absence of blood or foul smell in the sputum, the subjective fevers, and the impact on exercise. Crucially, it fails to list the specific symptoms denied (night sweats, weight loss, nausea, etc.), which was a core part of the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims are generally grounded in the transcript, but the one-month cough duration is a misinterpretation of P-19/P-21. Citing turn numbers like [P-5] for denials is accurate in reference but fails to extract the actual content.",
    "relevance": "The answer partially addresses the first part of the question. However, for the second part regarding denied symptoms, providing turn numbers instead of the names of the symptoms is not a direct or helpful response to the prompt's specific request ('which symptoms did she explicitly deny').\", \"The section on denied symptoms is particularly weak.\""
