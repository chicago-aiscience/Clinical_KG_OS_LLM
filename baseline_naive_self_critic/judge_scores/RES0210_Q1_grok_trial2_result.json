  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the cough as 'pretty bad' for 'a couple of days' [P-1], sputum as 'yellow custard' with 'spots of red' [P-6], chest pain on the 'right' side [P-17], and chills [P-9], all consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript with no factual errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: worsening cough timeline (Friday raspy, Sunday severe) - missed; sputum description (yellow custard with red spots starting Sunday) - fully covered; chest pain details (right-sided, constant, dull, worse with cough/deep breath) - only location covered, misses quality and exacerbating factors; fevers (subjective from Monday, ongoing) - missed; chills (last two days) - covered; dyspnea on exertion - missed; sore throat - missed; runny nose - missed; no weight loss - missed. Covers sputum fully, chills, partial cough and chest pain location (~25-30% of key points).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: cough [P-1], sputum [P-6], right chest pain [P-17], chills [P-9]; citations accurate; no unverifiable or hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists patient-reported symptoms in bullet points matching the question's focus on cough/sputum, chest pain, and systemic symptoms like chills; no off-topic content, perfectly structured response."
