  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states the doctor did not explore living situation, workplace, travel, or sick contacts, but the transcript shows the doctor asking about the living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48, D-50], and travel [D-49].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific details provided by the patient (apartment in the city, car dealership workplace, no travel) and instead focuses on irrelevant details like symptom assessment and management plans.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates that dialogue segments regarding exposure sources do not exist. It claims no segments referenced travel, workplace, or sick contacts, which is directly contradicted by multiple lines in the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's subject matter but provides a completely incorrect 'negative' response. It focuses on what it perceives as the absence of these questions rather than extracting the information requested."
