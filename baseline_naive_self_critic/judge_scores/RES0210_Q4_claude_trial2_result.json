  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer begins by denying the doctor asked these questions, but the transcript clearly shows the doctor asked about weight loss [D-22/P-22], travel [D-23/P-23], sick contacts [D-24/P-24], and chemical exposure [D-34/P-34]. This is a fundamental factual error that contradicts the source material. The Generated Answer then provides alternative analysis that, while medically plausible, does not address the actual question asked.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address any of the four specific screening questions mentioned in the question. It covers 0% of the Gold Answer's key points about: (1) weight loss screening for cancer/TB, (2) travel screening for endemic infections, (3) sick contacts screening for person-to-person transmission, and (4) chemical exposure screening for occupational lung disease. Instead, it provides unrelated differential diagnoses.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes a major hallucinated claim that contradicts the transcript - stating these questions were NOT asked when they clearly were. The transcript citations [D-22], [D-23], [D-24], and [D-34] directly show these questions being asked. The alternative analysis about cardiovascular and pulmonary differentials, while drawing from the transcript, is not what was asked and represents a significant deviation from the source material's focus.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the specific question asked. The question requested analysis of four particular screening questions and their differential diagnosis implications. Instead, the Generated Answer denies these questions exist and provides an entirely different clinical analysis. This is fundamentally off-topic despite being medically coherent."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contains a critical factual error by claiming the doctor did not ask about weight loss, travel, sick contacts, or chemical exposure, when the transcript clearly shows all four questions were asked with specific patient responses. This fundamental misreading of the source material results in complete failure to address the question. Instead of analyzing the differential diagnoses each screening question targeted (cancer/TB for weight loss, endemic infections for travel, person-to-person transmission for sick contacts, occupational disease for chemical exposure), the Generated Answer provides an unrelated alternative analysis. The response demonstrates 0% coverage of key points, contains hallucinated denials of documented questions, and is entirely off-topic despite being medically coherent in its alternative discussion."
