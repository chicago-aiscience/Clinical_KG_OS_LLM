  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it identifies goldfish as a 'potential trigger' [P-39] and claims the exacerbation is 'driven by... goldfish exposure.' In the transcript, the patient simply mentions having goldfish as pets when asked; they are never identified as a trigger. Additionally, the answer omits the specific frequency of bronchodilator use (once every two weeks baseline vs. 5-6 times per week currently), which was explicitly mentioned in the question and the transcript [P-8].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points found in the Gold Answer: 1) the specific numerical frequencies of inhaler use (1x/2 weeks and 5-6x/week), 2) the symptom of 'chest tightness' [P-20], 3) the observation that wheezing episodes are more frequent than inhaler use [P-17], and 4) the negative screening for infections/colds which helps define the exacerbation [P-21-P-28].",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that goldfish are a trigger is a hallucination. The transcript records the patient mentioning goldfish only as pets [P-39]. The rest of the answer is generally grounded in the transcript, although it lacks the detail found in the Gold Answer.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, focusing entirely on the evolution of the patient's asthma and current exacerbation as requested by the prompt."
