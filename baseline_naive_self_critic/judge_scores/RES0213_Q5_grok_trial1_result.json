  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the core contributions of family history (father's heart attack scaring her), smoking (history and quit stress), and psychosocial stressors (school and anxiety) to her heart disease concern, matching Gold's main points with correct citations; minor omissions like full smoking timeline, grandpa details, specific stressors (thesis, living alone, running), and anxiety history return, but no major contradictions; however, factual accuracy is slightly impacted by overgeneralizations.",
    "completeness": "Covers key points: family history fear [P-8], smoking details and quit difficulty [P-13,14], stressors like school/anxiety [P-13,20]; misses specifics like father's current heart doctors [P-30], grandpa accident [P-30], Masters social work/thesis crunch [P-15,16], living alone [P-26,27], nervous running [P-28], nervous breathing [P-19], past anxiety returning [P-22]; covers ~80% of Gold's key points and illustrations.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded in transcript with accurate quotes/cites (e.g., P-8,13,14,20); however, repeatedly references non-existent 'knowledge graph' (e.g., [FAMILY_HISTORY]--[CAUSES]-->stress, stress--[TRIGGER]-->chest pain) as source of causal links, which is hallucinated and not in transcript or Gold; multiple such unverifiable fabricated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around the three specified factors (family, smoking, stressors), their contributions/interactions with heart concern, and transcript details, perfectly matching question without off-topic content."
