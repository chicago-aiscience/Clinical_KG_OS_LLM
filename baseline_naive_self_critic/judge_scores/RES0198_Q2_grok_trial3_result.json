  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient tried decongestants [P-10], quotes the assessment as 'worked a little bit' [P-10] which aligns with Gold's description (minor simplification of ambiguity but no factual error), and correctly identifies Tylenol Cold as the recommended OTC [D-39], fully consistent with Gold Answer facts.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold: 1) Tried OTC decongestants [P-10] - covered; 2) Assessment ambiguous/'worked a little bit' with reasoning about nose transitioning from stuffy to runny [P-10] - partially covered (quote but misses reasoning); 3) Recommendations: hydration, Tylenol Cold, supportive care, few weeks resolution [D-39] - partially covered (Tylenol Cold only, misses hydration, timeframe, supportive/viral context). Covers ~75% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable: 'decongestants' and 'worked a little bit' in [P-10], 'Tylenol Cold' in [D-39]; citations accurate; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's three parts (medication tried, assessment, OTC recommended) with no off-topic content."
