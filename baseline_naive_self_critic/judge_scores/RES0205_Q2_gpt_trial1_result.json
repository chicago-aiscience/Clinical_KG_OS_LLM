  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "All statements made are consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: the patient is not currently taking anxiety medication and last took it 2–3 years ago (P-24), and manages reflux via dietary avoidance of triggers like acidic foods/chocolate (P-25). No incorrect or contradictory claims are introduced.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only anxiety and acid reflux. It omits key Gold Answer elements: (1) explicit statement that the patient is currently on zero prescribed medications overall (P-23); (2) hay fever status (no treatment described) (P-27); (3) cough treatment status—patient requested medication but none was prescribed/recommended in the transcript; plan was exam + discuss with supervising physician (P-35, D-37); (4) summary across all conditions. Overall it captures roughly a third of the required points.",
    "faithfulness": "All included details are directly supported by the transcript (P-24, P-25). No hallucinated medications, treatments, or plans are added.",
    "relevance": "What is included is on-topic (current meds/treatments), but the response does not answer the question \"across all conditions\" and fails to address the cough and hay fever, and does not clearly state whether they are taking any prescribed medications overall."
