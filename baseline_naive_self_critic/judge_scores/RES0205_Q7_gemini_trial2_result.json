  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate according to the transcript and consistent with the gold answer for the points it includes. It correctly identifies the two-week duration, the initial flu-like symptoms, the appearance and duration of mucus (4-5 days, whitish-clear), and the transition to a dry cough. However, it fails to mention that intensity and frequency remained stable over time, which was a specific requirement of the prompt.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the gold answer and the prompt. Specifically, it does not mention that the cough's intensity and frequency remained 'the same' throughout the period. It also omits details about the specific frequency (3-4 times an hour), the absence of fever, the specific flu symptoms (sore throat, runny nose), and the negative COVID test result.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the generated answer is directly supported by the transcript. There are no hallucinations or claims made that cannot be verified by the text provided.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant and addresses the majority of the prompt's requirements. However, it fails to explicitly answer the sub-question regarding 'how the cough's intensity and frequency changed over time,' instead focusing on current chest soreness."
