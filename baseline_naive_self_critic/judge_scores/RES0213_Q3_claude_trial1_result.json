  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly diagnoses Conversion Disorder when the Gold Answer clearly identifies anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain. Conversion Disorder involves neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness, seizures) not explained by medical conditions, whereas this case involves chest pain in the context of anxiety and stress. The Generated Answer fundamentally misidentifies the condition, representing a significant factual error in clinical diagnosis.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers some key points from the Gold Answer (anxiety history, stress from thesis, pain pattern related to being alone vs. distracted, failure of analgesics) but misses critical observations including: breathing pattern changes during episodes, pertinent negatives (no fevers, no exertional worsening, pain at rest, no palpitations outside anxiety, no asthma), and the specific transcript citations that support the diagnosis. The answer addresses perhaps 50-60% of the Gold Answer's key supporting evidence.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations [P-21], [P-13], [P-20], [P-8], [P-6]. However, the statement about 'symptom acts as a displaced expression of conflict to gain attention or reduce stress' represents interpretation beyond what is stated in the transcript and introduces theoretical framing not evidenced in the source material. The knowledge graph references appear fabricated as no such graph was provided in the source materials.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the question about diagnosis and supporting clinical observations. However, the incorrect diagnosis (Conversion Disorder vs. anxiety-related chest pain) significantly undermines relevance, as it mischaracterizes the clinical picture. The supporting observations are relevant but framed around an inappropriate diagnostic conclusion."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant clinical inaccuracy by diagnosing Conversion Disorder instead of anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain. While it identifies relevant observations (anxiety history, academic stress, situational pain pattern), it misses critical supporting details like breathing changes and pertinent negatives. The answer includes some fabricated elements (knowledge graph references) and misapplies psychosomatic theory. The fundamental diagnostic error substantially undermines the response's clinical utility despite covering some correct supporting observations."
