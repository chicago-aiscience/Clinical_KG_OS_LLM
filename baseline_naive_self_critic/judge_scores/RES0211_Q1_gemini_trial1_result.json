  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the dry cough, scratchy throat, malaise, and headache. However, it fails significantly by stating that the transcript does not contain denials of sputum production, nausea, joint pain, or rashes. These denials are explicitly present in the transcript (P-6 for phlegm, P-11 for nausea, P-13 for joint aches, and P-10 for rashes). It also interprets the denial of joint pain as a general denial of 'hurting' while missing the specific denial of joints.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key reported symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer, specifically 'feeling hot' (feverish) and 'tiredness'. Crucially, it fails to list the denied symptoms requested by the prompt (sputum, nausea, joint pain, rashes), claiming they are not in the text when they are.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer contains a major hallucination regarding the contents of the source text. It claims that the transcript segments do not contain explicit mentions of several denied symptoms, yet these symptoms are directly addressed in the dialogue between the doctor and the patient.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in its structure as it attempts to address both reported and denied symptoms, but its content is largely inaccurate regarding the denials."
