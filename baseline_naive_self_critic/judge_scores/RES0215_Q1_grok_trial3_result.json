  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies wheezing and 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' [P-2] as the earliest symptoms explicitly in response to the doctor's question about what was noticed first four to five days ago, while also listing presentation symptoms including wheezy for 4-5 days, short of breath, slight cough [P-1], out of breath with activity [P-3], hard time catching breath without cyanosis [P-32], cough recent and non-productive [P-1, P-31]. The Generated Answer correctly lists wheezy, shortness of breath, slight cough, and difficulty taking deep breaths as symptoms with accurate citations, and notes cough as later via P-1 phrasing. However, it incorrectly identifies only 'wheezy' as the earliest symptom based on P-1, ignoring the paired mention in P-2, and omits details like activity-related SOB, non-cyanosis, and non-productive cough. This constitutes some factual errors (primarily on earliest symptoms) but maintains the main point of symptoms and their timing.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points covered: presentation wheezy/SOB/cough (100%), cough recent (100%), difficulty deep breaths as symptom (100%). Partially covered: earliest symptoms (only wheezy, misses difficulty deep breaths pairing). Missed: out of breath with activity [P-3], hard time catching breath/no cyanosis [P-32], non-productive cough [P-31], looks fine otherwise [P-9]. Covers approximately 60-70% of elaborated key points, sufficient for main symptoms but lacking detail on earliest and additional qualifiers.",
    "faithfulness": "All listed symptoms directly verifiable: wheezy/short of breath/slight cough [P-1], difficulty deep breaths [P-2], with accurate citations. Earliest wheezy claim grounded in P-1 ('quite wheezy for past 4-5 days and now cough'), though direct 'first noticed' response [P-2] includes more; no hallucinations or fabrications, all transcript-based.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by listing specific respiratory symptoms reported at presentation and identifying the earliest (wheezy), using structured format with evidence; no irrelevant content or tangents."
