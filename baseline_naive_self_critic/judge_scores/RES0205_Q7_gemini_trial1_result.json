  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer regarding the two-week duration, the timing of mucus production (first 4-5 days), the color of the mucus (whitish clear), and the transition to a dry cough. It correctly notes that non-cough symptoms resolved within 3-4 days.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer. It does not specify what the 'flu-like symptoms' were (sore throat and runny nose). Most importantly, it completely omits the information regarding the frequency of the cough (3-4 times per hour) and the fact that both intensity and frequency remained stable over time, which was explicitly requested in the prompt. It also misses the negative COVID test and the absence of fever.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are well-supported by the transcript. The descriptions of mucus, the timeline for its resolution, and the mention of chest soreness are all grounded in the provided dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The answer is mostly relevant but fails to fully address the specific instruction to describe how intensity and frequency changed over time (it mentions the presence of pain but not the lack of change in the cough's pattern) and ignores the frequency aspect entirely."
