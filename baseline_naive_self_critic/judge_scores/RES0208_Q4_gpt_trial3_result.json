  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a major factual error: it states the transcript does not explicitly include the doctor asking about chest pain, palpitations, runny nose, and nausea. In fact, these are explicitly asked and denied in the transcript (runny nose/congestion [D-10/P-10], nausea/vomiting [D-15/P-15], chest pain [D-16/P-16], heart beating really fast/palpitations [D-17/P-17]). It also misattributes diagnostic reasoning to [D-37] rather than the clinician’s explicit synthesis at [D-36], and introduces an extraneous “knowledge graph” reference not present in the source. While its general clinical differentiation logic (cardiac vs respiratory vs GI) aligns with the Gold Answer, the core symptom-identification portion is incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key negatives include: runny nose/congestion; vision/hearing changes; nausea/vomiting; chest pain; palpitations; abdominal pain; urinary symptoms; numbness/tingling. The Generated Answer fails to list most of these and instead focuses on cough/appetite/taste (not the asked-and-negated ROS items requested). It partially discusses the diagnostic role of absent chest pain/palpitations/runny nose/nausea but does not cover vision/hearing, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, numbness/tingling as in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded in the transcript: (1) claiming chest pain/palpitations/runny nose/nausea are not explicitly asked about (they are); (2) citing a “knowledge graph” relationship not in the transcript. Some content is grounded (patient had minimal cough [P-8], decreased appetite/taste [P-2, P-4]), but these do not answer the specific ROS-negatives question and do not compensate for the key unfaithful claims.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to answer both parts of the question (which symptoms were negated; how those negatives narrow the differential). However, it significantly deviates by asserting the key symptoms were not present and by emphasizing other symptoms (appetite/taste/cough) rather than listing the explicitly negated ROS findings. Still, its differential-diagnosis discussion is generally on-topic."
