  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies sore throat, worsening difficulty breathing, reduced taste (without smell loss), and fatigue/muscle aches as the key symptom combination leading to COVID-19 suspicion [D-43], plus exposure context. Generated Answer incorrectly focuses only on sore throat and reduced taste, omits critical dyspnea and myalgias/fatigue, misinterprets 'not smell' [P-19] as olfactory dysfunction (it's intact), and fabricates a 'knowledge graph' with specific links not present, leading to significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: doctor's statement [D-43]; sore throat details [P-2,P-4]; dyspnea onset/worsening [P-8-10]; reduced taste details [P-19-21]; fatigue/aches [P-25-26]; screening [D-19]; exposure [P-12,13]; immunizations [P-14]. Covered: sore throat, reduced taste, doctor's statement (~30%). Missed: dyspnea, fatigue/aches, exposure/immunizations details.",
    "faithfulness": "Cites transcript accurately for sore throat [P-2,6], taste [P-19], doctor [D-43]. Hallucinates 'knowledge graph' and symptom-diagnosis links; wrongly claims 'olfactory function is affected (\"not smell\")' contradicting [P-19] ('maybe taste a little bit but not smell' means smell intact); infers 'loss of taste' instead of reduction.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses symptom combination for suspicion and taste-without-smell aspect with structured breakdown; minor off-topic tangent with fabricated KG."
