  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the overall two-week duration, initial flu-like symptoms in the first couple of days, whitish clear mucus for the first 4-5 days, transition to dry cough afterward, and resolution of other symptoms in 3-4 days, aligning with Gold; however, it inaccurately splits mucus into phases (initial 1-3 days and then 4-5), omits specific sore throat (2-3 days), runny nose, no fevers, stable cough intensity and frequency (key to question, stated as 'same' and 'no' change in Gold/P-7,P-8), specific frequency (3-4x/hour), spontaneity, and frames chest soreness as 'chest pain'; core timeline is correct but with some factual discrepancies and omissions.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: 2-week onset [P-2], flu-like first couple days [P-14], mucus whitish clear first 4-5 days [P-6], transition to dry [P-5,P-6], other symptoms resolved 3-4 days [P-14], chest soreness [P-15,P-16]; missed: sore throat specifically 2-3 days [P-13], runny nose detail, no fevers [P-12], intensity remained the same [P-7], frequency stable at 3-4x/hour spontaneous [P-8-P-10], COVID test negative [P-35,P-36]; covers ~60-70% of key points including core timeline but misses cough change details specified in question.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: 2-week cough [P-2], flu-like [P-14], mucus details/timeline [P-6], dry transition [P-5,P-6], resolution [P-14], chest soreness [P-15,P-16]; citations accurate; minor issues: references non-existent 'knowledge graph' (hallucination), calls soreness 'chest pain' (slight overstatement, plausible from [P-15]); largely grounded with minor unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Structures a clear timeline directly addressing onset, mucus duration/appearance, transition, other symptom resolution; mostly relevant but fails to explicitly cover cough intensity/frequency changes over time (question-specific, implied stable but not stated), no irrelevant content."
