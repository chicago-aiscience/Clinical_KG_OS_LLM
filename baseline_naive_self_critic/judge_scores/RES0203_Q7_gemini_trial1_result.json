  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several factual inaccuracies regarding the transcript's content. It claims the transcript 'does not specify an order of onset,' whereas [D-6, P-6] explicitly confirms the symptoms started at the same time. It also states the patient 'does not mention having experienced similar symptoms,' ignoring the explicit denial in [D-3, P-3]. However, it correctly identifies the two-day timeframe and the concurrent nature of the symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the 'partial' nature of the sensory loss (the ability to smell strong odors or taste salty foods like bananas), which is a specific detail of how symptoms developed. It also omits the patient's explicit confirmation that symptoms were 'consistent' [D-5, D-8], instead stating there is 'no evidence' of fluctuation.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly faithful but misrepresents the transcript by claiming information is absent when it is actually present. It relies almost exclusively on [P-1] and ignores the clarifying segments of the dialogue [D-3 through D-8]. There are no invented facts, but the omission of existing dialogue points leads to false claims about the transcript's limitations.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all parts of the question, including the timeframe, relative onset, fluctuation, and previous history, although some of the information provided is inaccurate or incomplete."
