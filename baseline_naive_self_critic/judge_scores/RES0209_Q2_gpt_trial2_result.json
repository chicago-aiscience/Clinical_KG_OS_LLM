  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient’s only current asthma medication as a bronchodilator/rescue medication and that it is administered via an inhaler/puffer. It also correctly states the clinician asked about a medication taken daily (a controller/maintenance medication) that the patient does not have. Minor issues: it phrases the clinician’s question as “likely asked” (the transcript shows they explicitly asked), and it cites inhaler administration to [P-1] even though the “puffer” detail appears at [P-7]/[D-7].",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer required by the question are largely covered: (1) bronchodilator as the only asthma medication, (2) administered via inhaler/puffer, and (3) lacks a daily controller/maintenance medication the clinician asked about. It does not explicitly state “as-needed” use as directly as the Gold Answer (though it strongly implies it), and it omits the supportive detail that the patient denies any other medications.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript (bronchodilator use, increased frequency, exercise/cold triggers, no daily medication). The main faithfulness concern is minor: the answer labels the missing medication as a “controller inhaler,” whereas the transcript only specifies a medication taken daily (not explicitly an inhaler), and the inhaler/puffer claim is cited to the wrong line.",
    "relevance": "The response directly addresses the question (current medication, administration method, and the missing daily controller medication). It includes a small amount of extra context about triggers, but this does not substantially detract from answering the question."
