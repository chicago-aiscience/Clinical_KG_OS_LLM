  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the stuffy nose as the first symptom and the fever as lasting three days. It correctly notes the husband's symptoms lasted a week. However, it is slightly less precise than the Gold Answer regarding the sore throat; the patient stated the sore throat occurred 'just before' the fever (placing it early in the progression), whereas the Generated Answer lists it under subsequent symptoms after the fever is mentioned. It also lacks the specific calculation of the 4-day gap between the husband's and the patient's onset.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points: stuffy nose first, fever duration, muscle aches, and husband's timeline. It misses the specific nuance that the sore throat preceded the fever (as noted in the Gold Answer and P-1) and doesn't explicitly calculate the onset difference in days (4 days) between the husband and patient, though it correctly notes the husband started earlier.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript. All durations (3-day fever, 1-week husband symptoms) and the symptom types (stuffy nose, fever, sore throat, muscle aches) are directly supported by the text. No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all parts of the question: the chronological progression, the first symptom, and the comparison with the husband's timeline."
