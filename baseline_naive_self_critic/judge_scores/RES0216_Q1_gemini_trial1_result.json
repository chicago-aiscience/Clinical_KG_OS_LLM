  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the positive symptoms reported by the patient (chest tightness, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, and phlegm). However, it contains a significant factual error in the 'Note' section, claiming that the transcript does not contain explicit denials for fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, anxiety, and sweating. In reality, the patient explicitly denies these in turns P-6 (anxiety/sweating), P-12 (fevers), P-13 (night sweats), P-14 (chills), and P-15 (weight loss).",
    "completeness": "The answer is incomplete as it misses the majority of the 'explicitly denied' symptoms requested by the prompt and covered in the gold answer. It only lists cough and chest pain as denied, omitting six other symptoms specifically asked for in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer provides accurate citations for the symptoms it does include. However, it fails the faithfulness test by making a false meta-claim that certain information is missing from the transcript when it is clearly present in turns P-6 through P-15.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the prompt's structure but fails to provide the specific information requested regarding the list of denied symptoms, despite that information being available in the source text."
