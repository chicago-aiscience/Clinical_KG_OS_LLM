  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition (COVID), the test (COVID swab), and the specific detail about social contacts (walking dogs with a friend who was sick and being too close) as specified in the gold answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers all parts of the question. However, it misses the additional context provided in the gold answer regarding the negative screening for other COVID-specific symptoms (smell, taste, confusion, travel) which the gold answer uses to provide a fuller picture of the doctor's assessment.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly faithful to the transcript and uses appropriate citations. However, it includes a minor hallucination/artifact by mentioning a 'knowledge graph' ('cited in the knowledge graph'), which is not present in the transcript or gold answer.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and follows the structure of the question exactly."
