  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and aligns with the Gold Answer regarding the character of the cough (dry, nonstop), the shortness of breath, and the wheezing. It accurately identifies triggers like cold air and physical activity as mentioned in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses one specific detail explicitly requested in the prompt: 'chest sensations'. The Gold Answer correctly includes 'chest tightness' (P-20), while the Generated Answer omits it. Additionally, it misses the 'two-week' duration mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly supported by the transcript and include accurate speaker references (e.g., [P-1], [P-11], [P-18]). No hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question's requirements regarding symptoms, character of cough, breathing difficulties, wheezing, and frequency differences, though it falls short on the 'chest sensations' sub-point."
