  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates high factual accuracy with all major facts correctly extracted from the transcript. The COVID swab test, 24-48 hour turnaround, 14-day isolation, false negative possibility, alternative viral illness diagnosis, and warning signs are all accurately stated. The answer correctly identifies the assessment as an infection and COVID-compatible symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers approximately 85-90% of the Gold Answer's key points. It includes: (1) COVID swab with timing, (2) 14-day isolation including sister, (3) false negative possibility, (4) alternative viral illness, and (5) specific warning signs. However, it omits the important point from D-45 about asthma being on the differential if only cough/SOB without fever were present, and doesn't mention the watchful waiting approach with no medications prescribed.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The COVID swab order [D-44], 24-48 hour turnaround [D-44], 14-day isolation [D-44], false negatives [D-44], alternative viral illness [D-44], and all warning signs [D-44] are properly grounded. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly focused and directly addresses all aspects of the multi-part question. It systematically covers the diagnostic test, turnaround time, isolation period, alternative diagnosis, false negatives, and warning signs with examples. The structure mirrors the question components, making it highly relevant with no off-topic content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent response with high accuracy, strong grounding in the transcript, and perfect relevance to the question. It captures all major elements of the doctor's assessment and management plan including the COVID test, isolation recommendations, and detailed warning signs. The only notable omission is the asthma differential discussion from D-45 and the explicit statement about watchful waiting with no medications, which prevents a perfect completeness score. All facts are correctly stated and properly cited."
