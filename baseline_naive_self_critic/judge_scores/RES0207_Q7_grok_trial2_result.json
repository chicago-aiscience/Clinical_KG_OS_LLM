  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts (seizure last night [P-8], forgot Keppra [P-9], epilepsy [P-8], sudden SOB upon waking [P-1], dry cough [P-4], decision to seek care due to uncertainty [P-1]) are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript; no contradictions or errors, though minor discrepancies in precise sequencing (e.g., seizure timing relative to evening events) and omission of details like birthday celebration do not introduce inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: seizure last night (partial), forgot Keppra (partial, misses birthday [P-24]), sudden SOB and cough onset morning (yes), decision to seek care (yes). Missed entirely: birthday disruption [P-24], fine after seizure and went to bed [P-8], ~3 hours onset [P-11], temperature check 37.4°C [P-5,P-6], never had SOB before [P-3], uncertainty about relation to seizure [P-8]. Covers ~50-60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like seizure [P-8], forgot meds [P-9], SOB [P-1], cough [P-4], Keppra [P-23], family history [P-26] are verifiable with accurate citations. However, references to 'knowledge graph provided' and '[PRECIPITATING_FACTOR]' are not in the transcript (hallucinated additions, though plausible); minor unverifiable details but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly reconstructs timeline addressing seizure, respiratory onset, and decision to seek care; minor tangents include KG references, Keppra as 'treatment', and 'during consultation' family history which extends beyond pre-consultation events."
