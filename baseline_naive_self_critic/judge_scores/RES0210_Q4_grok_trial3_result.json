  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states there is 'no evidence' in the transcript that the doctor asked about weight loss [D-22], recent travel [D-23], sick contacts [D-24], or chemical exposure [D-34], despite these questions being explicitly present with patient responses [P-22, P-23, P-24, P-34]. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer, which accurately identifies the questions and links them to differentials like lung cancer, TB, endemic infections, and occupational lung disease. The Generated Answer hallucinates a 'Knowledge Graph' not in the source and proposes unrelated differentials (e.g., angina), ignoring the question's focus. All facts are inconsistent with Gold Answer. Score: 1",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer covers key points for each question: weight loss screening lung cancer/TB (denial less likely); travel for infections (Sarnia timing noted); sick contacts for person-to-person/TB (absence reduces); chemical exposure for pneumonitis (limited exposure less likely); collective favor acute infection. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, refusing to analyze due to fabricated absence of questions and instead discussing symptom-based differentials like angina and pneumonia not tied to the queries. Score: 1",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer fabricates absence of explicit transcript questions [D-22 to D-24, D-34], references non-existent 'Knowledge Graph,' and unverifiable claims (e.g., chest pain linked to KG as cardiovascular). No claims about the specific questions are grounded; all analysis hallucinates around symptoms unrelated to the query. Largely fabricated. Score: 1",
    "relevance": "The question specifically asks about differentials screened by the four named questions and response impacts. Generated Answer denies questions exist, deems analysis impossible, then pivots to unrelated symptom-based differentials (e.g., cardiovascular, oncologic from smoking), ignoring the core prompt. Does not address the question. Score: 1"
