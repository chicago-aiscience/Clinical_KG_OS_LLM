  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer accurately extracts the doctor's summary assessment from [D-47] (cough for a little while, worse last 3 days, greenish sputum no blood, no constitutional symptoms), plan to review story with supervising doctors [D-47], and implies next steps guided by that review, with no tests ordered. The Generated Answer incorrectly claims no doctor turns exist and transcript ends at [P-27], directly contradicting the full transcript provided up to [D-48] and the Gold Answer's facts. This is a complete factual error.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: summary assessment details ([D-47]), absence of constitutional symptoms ([D-47], cross-ref P-5-P-8), plan to review with doctors ([D-47]), patient add-on and response ([P-47],[D-48]), no tests/treatments, next steps by supervising MD. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead asserting information unavailable.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that transcript contains only patient turns [P-1] to [P-27] (mentions cat allergy hypothesis), claims no doctor responses or plans; actual transcript has full D-1 to D-48 turns, including exact relevant [D-47]-[D-48]. No verifiable basis for claims of missing doctor parts; largely fabricated absence.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for doctor's plan, assessment, and next-steps guidance at end; Generated Answer does not provide any, instead off-topic claim of missing transcript data, failing to address or analyze the provided source."
