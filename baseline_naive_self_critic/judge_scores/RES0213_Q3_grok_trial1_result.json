  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer diagnoses anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain, supported by specific situational patterns, history, stress, symptoms during episodes, patient insight, and pertinent negatives. Generated Answer incorrectly diagnoses Conversion Disorder (Psychogenic Pain Disorder), which is not supported by the transcript or Gold; conversion typically involves neurological deficits rather than pain modulated by distraction, representing a significant factual contradiction. Some supporting elements like anxiety history and stress are noted but misframed.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) situational alone vs. distracted [P-4,P-9,P-29]; 2) anxiety history [P-21,P-22]; 3) thesis stress [P-13,P-15,P-16]; 4) nervousness/breathing [P-19]; 5) patient links to stress [P-8]; 6) negatives (no fever [P-12], no exertional [P-10], rest [P-11], no palps [P-20], no asthma [P-23,P-24]). Generated covers anxiety history [P-21], stress [P-13], partial situational [P-20 mis-cited], family fear [P-8], no med relief [P-6]; misses most negatives, breathing details, precise situational citations, and correct diagnosis—covers ~40-50%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like anxiety history [P-21], stress [P-13], family fear [P-8], no med relief [P-6] verifiable; however, hallucinates 'knowledge graph' repeatedly (absent from transcript), mis-cites P-20 for environmental dependency (P-20 is about palpitations), adds ungrounded theory on 'displaced expression of conflict to gain attention'; diagnosis of conversion disorder not in transcript—multiple hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly proposes a diagnosis and lists supporting clinical observations with citations, perfectly matching the question's request despite inaccuracies."
