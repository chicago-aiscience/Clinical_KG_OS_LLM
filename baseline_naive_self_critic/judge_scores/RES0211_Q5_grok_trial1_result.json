  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the transcript lacks information on father's allergies (present in [P-33]), cousin's asthma ([P-30]), and brother's cold ([P-39]/[D-58]), directly contradicting the Gold Answer and transcript. It misinterprets the farm living situation by claiming it 'contradicts the premise' despite confirmation in [P-43], and wrongly attributes symptoms primarily to seasonal allergies despite Gold noting off-season timing ([P-16]/[P-17]). Multiple factual errors make it mostly incorrect.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points (father allergies [P-33], cousin asthma [P-30], brother cold [P-39/D-58] as viral source, farm living [P-43/44] with isolation [P-41/42/45/46], only dog [P-48], differs from typical allergies) are almost entirely missed or misrepresented; Generated denies family/brother details, misstates farm, ignores isolation and viral link. Covers <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims of 'missing information' on key family history and brother cold are hallucinations as these are explicitly in transcript ([P-30,33,39]); farm denial ignores [P-43]; some correct citations (e.g., symptoms [P-1], allergies [P-16]) but multiple unverifiable denials.",
    "relevance": "Question asks how specific factors (father allergies, cousin asthma, brother cold, farm/homeschool) relate collectively to symptoms; Generated dismisses most as absent, pivots to allergies and non-farm home, failing to address the queried elements directly."
