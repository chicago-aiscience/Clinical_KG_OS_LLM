  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies that the child only uses occasional OTC antihistamines (Reactine/“over the counter stuff”) for seasonal allergies and that there are no prescribed medications (supported by P-36, P-46, P-47). However, it omits an important treatment detail for the current respiratory episodes: the mother gives her nothing and symptoms resolve with rest (P-34). It also introduces an extraneous/unsupported reference to a “knowledge graph,” which is not part of the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Covered: (1) intermittent OTC Reactine/OTC allergy meds; (2) explicitly no prescribed medications.\nMissed: (1) for the current wheezing/SOB episodes, the mother does not give any treatment and they resolve on their own with rest (P-33/P-34); (2) confirmation of no regular medications aside from occasional Reactine (P-46/P-47); (3) prior viral infections did not require antibiotics (P-16). Overall, it captures the main medication list but not all key management details asked (especially for the current respiratory episodes).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript (P-36; P-46; P-47). The mention of “knowledge graph information” and attributing associations to it is not verifiable from the provided transcript and is therefore an ungrounded addition, though it does not materially change the medication facts.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on medications/treatments the child has taken and whether any prescribed medication was part of management. It is largely on-target, with only minor irrelevant framing (“knowledge graph”)."
