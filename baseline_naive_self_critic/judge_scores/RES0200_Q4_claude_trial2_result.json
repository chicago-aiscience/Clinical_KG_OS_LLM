  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 (referred to as 'Covid') as the alternative diagnosis, correctly names the COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and accurately states the 24-48 hour turnaround time. All facts align with the Gold Answer and the transcript [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key points requested in the question: (1) the alternative diagnosis (COVID), (2) the specific diagnostic test (COVID swab), and (3) the turnaround time (24-48 hours). However, it lacks the additional context provided in the Gold Answer about which specific symptoms overlapped (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) and the broader treatment plan mentioned. While these details add richness, they are not explicitly requested by the question, so the core requirements are met.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is fully grounded in the transcript with accurate citation [D-52]. All claims are directly verifiable in the source material. The doctor explicitly states 'because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid we'll also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that' and 'you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours.' No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly and precisely addresses all three parts of the question without any tangential information. It maintains focus on the alternative diagnosis, the diagnostic test, and the turnaround time, making it highly relevant to the query."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis to exclude, correctly names the COVID swab as the diagnostic test ordered, and precisely states the 24-48 hour expected turnaround time, all properly cited from [D-52]. While it lacks some contextual details about overlapping symptoms present in the Gold Answer, it fully addresses all three components of the question with factual accuracy and proper grounding in the transcript. The response is concise, relevant, and faithful to the source material."
