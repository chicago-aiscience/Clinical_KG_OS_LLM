  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the start of the sore throat (4 days ago) and the onset of breathing difficulties (yesterday). However, it fails to correctly sequence the muscle aches and loss of taste. The muscle aches started immediately after the sore throat (day 1/2), and the loss of taste started two days ago (day 3), but the Generated Answer simply lists them under 'Current Status' without temporal placement.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it omits the symptom of fatigue, fails to mention the specific timing for the loss of taste (2 days ago) and muscle aches (immediately after sore throat), and excludes the detail about failed self-treatment (salt-water gargles and painkillers).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful but expresses unnecessary uncertainty regarding the symptom that started yesterday. Transcript segments P-7 and P-8 explicitly link 'difficulty breathing' to starting 'yesterday', whereas the Generated Answer claims the transcript only specifies 'that'.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question but does not fully satisfy the 'chronological order' requirement for all symptoms mentioned, as it relegates two symptoms with specific onset times to a general 'Current Status' category."
