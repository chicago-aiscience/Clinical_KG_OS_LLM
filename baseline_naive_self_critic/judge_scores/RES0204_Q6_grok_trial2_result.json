  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core elements of the doctor's plan as per the Gold Answer, including the two diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), consultation with the supervising physician, and follow-up steps. Minor discrepancies include slightly imprecise citations (e.g., [D-39] for X-ray explanation, which is actually [D-38/D-39]) and presenting the X-ray as definite rather than tentative ('might want to'), but no factual errors contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: diagnostic tests (both chest X-ray and COVID swab with explanations), consultation (fetch supervising doctor), follow-up (return to discuss next steps). Partially covers initial visit structure (chat/exam implied but not explicit); misses explicit mention of lung/heart exam and patient acknowledgment. Covers approximately 85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: tests [D-37-D-39], consultation [D-1, D-37], follow-up [D-1, D-40], reassurances [D-37, D-39]. Minor citation overlap (D-39 covers both tests' explanations) but no hallucinations or ungrounded content.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is structured perfectly around the question's requirements (tests, consultation, follow-up), with clear sections directly addressing each element and no off-topic content."
