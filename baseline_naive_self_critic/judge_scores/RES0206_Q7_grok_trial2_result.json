  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer details baseline comprehensively (puffers [P-1], lifestyle [P-28], inhaler frequency [P-26], dog walks [P-4]). Generated covers baseline puffers [P-1] accurately but omits others. Acute symptoms match (cough increase, green-yellow sputum, dyspnea, hemoptysis [P-1]). Worsening implied but not directly from [P-2]. Severity comparison accurate ([P-3] worst, prior sick-related). Adds accurate doctor impression [D-43] and minor plausible interpretation. Introduces 'knowledge graph' not in transcript, minor discrepancy. Core facts consistent, no major errors.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: baseline (4 points: puffers, lifestyle, inhaler freq, activities) - covers 1/4; acute symptoms (cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea, exercise tol decline [P-4], fever [P-9]) - covers 4/6; worsening explicit [P-2] - implied only; severity (worst [P-3], prior sick [P-3], ED visits x2 no hosp [P-5/6]) - covers 2/4. Covers ~60% of key points (strong on core symptoms/severity, misses baseline depth, fever, exercise details, ED history, explicit worsening).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims grounded: symptoms [P-1], severity [P-3], doctor note [D-43] verifiable in transcript. Hallucinations: multiple references to 'knowledge graph' and its 'clinical indicators' - not present in source transcript, fabricated external source. Some plausible but unverifiable additions. Multiple hallucinated elements.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around baseline evolution over 3 days, worsening vs improvement, and severity comparison to priors, perfectly matching question components with no off-topic content."
