  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all factual elements from the Gold Answer and transcript, including labs (CBC, electrolytes, kidney function, ABG), chest X-ray, O2 saturation monitoring, supplemental O2, steroids, antibiotics, bronchodilators continuation, and COVID swab. Minor discrepancies: COVID swab categorized under therapeutics instead of labs; omits BP monitoring from [D-37]; adds accurate reference to patient's specific bronchodilators from [P-11]. Core facts fully consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: all labs (100%), COVID swab, chest X-ray, O2 sat monitoring and supplemental O2, all therapeutics (bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, O2). Missed: BP monitoring mention from [D-37]. Covers ~90-95% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: labs/imaging/monitoring/therapeutics/COVID from [D-52]; bronchodilators specifics from [P-11]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to match question's requested categories (labs, imaging, monitoring, therapeutics including specified items), fully focused on doctor's plan from [D-52] with no off-topic content."
