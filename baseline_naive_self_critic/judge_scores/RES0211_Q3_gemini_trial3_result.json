  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies the core symptoms (dry cough, scratchy throat, headache, malaise) and the absence of certain symptoms (sputum, GI issues, joint pain). However, it incorrectly refers to 'tiredness' as a 'proxy for subjective fever' [P-13]; in the transcript, the patient explicitly reports feeling hot and having fevers [P-7, P-9], so a 'proxy' is unnecessary and slightly inaccurate. It also overstates that a dry cough 'rules out' pneumonia, whereas the Gold Answer more accurately states it 'suggests' upper rather than lower involvement.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses three significant points found in the Gold Answer: 1) the specific 3-4 day timeline which supports the URI diagnosis, 2) the household exposure (the brother's recent cold), and 3) the doctor's own summary/framing of the illness. It covers approximately 70% of the reasoning present in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer generally follows the transcript but contains a citation error. It cites [P-1] for the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, but GI symptoms are actually addressed in [P-11] and [P-12]. P-1 only covers the cough, throat, and headache.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, directly addressing the question by organizing the clinical reasoning into four distinct categories (Localized symptoms, Systemic signs, Allergy exclusion, and Absence of other pathology)."
