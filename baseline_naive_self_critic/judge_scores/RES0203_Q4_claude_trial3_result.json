  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It states that 'there were no negative findings documented' and that 'the doctor did not screen for these specific symptoms,' which directly contradicts the transcript. The transcript clearly shows the doctor systematically asked about and documented multiple negative findings including fevers [D-10, P-10], difficulty breathing [D-11, P-11], headaches [D-12, P-12], sore throat [D-13, P-13], chills/night sweats [D-14, P-14], muscle aches/weakness [D-15, P-15], and chest pain [D-22, P-22]. This is a fundamental misreading of the source material.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to address the question's requirements entirely. It does not list any of the negative findings from the review of systems, nor does it explain how these absences informed the clinical picture. Instead, it incorrectly claims these symptoms were not screened for and focuses only on positive findings. The Gold Answer correctly identifies at least 9 specific negative findings with citations, while the Generated Answer provides none.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant fabrications. The claim that 'the doctor did not screen for these specific symptoms' is demonstrably false based on the transcript [D-10 through D-22]. This represents a critical hallucination as it invents the absence of information that is clearly present in the source material. The Generated Answer fails the faithfulness test by contradicting verifiable facts in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is largely irrelevant to the question asked. The question specifically requests negative findings from the review of systems and their clinical significance, but the Generated Answer focuses on positive findings and incorrectly claims negative findings were not documented. While it attempts to address clinical picture, it does so from an entirely incorrect premise that makes the response unhelpful for answering the actual question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer fails on all evaluation dimensions. It contains a fundamental factual error by claiming the doctor did not screen for symptoms like fever, dyspnea, and sore throat, when the transcript clearly shows systematic screening for these and other symptoms [D-10 through D-22]. This error propagates throughout the response, making it completely miss the question's requirements. The answer provides no list of negative findings, offers no explanation of their clinical significance, and demonstrates a critical misreading of the source material. The response is not grounded in the transcript and does not address what was asked."
