  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports all mentioned symptoms with correct citations and phrasing consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript. Minor issues include categorizing sinus pressure as respiratory (Gold lists it as systemic), omitting the 'possible' nuance for fever, and not detailing reduced exercise tolerance or headache, but no factual errors or contradictions exist in what is stated.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: increased cough [P-1], green yellowy sputum [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], worsened dyspnea/shortness of breath [P-1], sinus pressure [P-12], possible fever [P-9], most bothersome symptom as cough [P-12]. Missed: reduced exercise tolerance [P-4], mild headache [P-14], pertinent negatives. Covers approximately 80% of positive symptom key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-1] for cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea; [P-12] for sinus and most bothersome; [P-9] for fever). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; reference to 'knowledge graph' is extraneous but does not introduce fabricated content.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, and most bothersome symptom, perfectly matching the question with no off-topic content."
