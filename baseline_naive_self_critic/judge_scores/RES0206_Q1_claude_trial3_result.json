  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all major respiratory symptoms mentioned in the transcript including increased cough, green-yellow sputum production, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. It correctly identifies the fever and sinus pressure. The most bothersome symptom (cough) is accurately stated with proper citation. However, it omits some details present in the Gold Answer: the specific description of exercise tolerance/walking difficulties mentioned in [P-4], the mild headache in [P-14], and the patient's note about not using home oxygen. These are factual omissions but the core facts are correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer including all major respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, dyspnea), systemic symptoms (fever, sinus pressure), and correctly identifies cough as most bothersome. However, it omits several details: reduced exercise tolerance/walking difficulty [P-4], mild headache [P-14], lack of home oxygen use, and all pertinent negatives (no sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, weight loss, night sweats, taste/smell changes, confusion, muscle aches). Covers approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The symptoms listed (increased cough [P-1], green-yellow sputum [P-1], hemoptysis [P-1], dyspnea [P-1], fever [P-9], sinus pressure [P-12], and cough as most bothersome [P-12]) are all properly grounded. No hallucinated content detected. The answer stays faithful to the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question about respiratory and systemic symptoms during the 3-day worsening and correctly identifies the most bothersome symptom. All content is relevant to the question asked. There is clear organization distinguishing respiratory from systemic symptoms. No off-topic or irrelevant information included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an accurate and well-organized response that correctly identifies the major respiratory symptoms (increased cough, green-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea), systemic symptoms (fever, sinus pressure), and the most bothersome symptom (cough) with proper citations. It is fully faithful to the transcript with no hallucinations. However, it lacks completeness by omitting exercise tolerance details, headache mention, and all pertinent negative findings that were included in the Gold Answer. Despite these omissions, the answer remains highly relevant and factually correct for the core elements of the question."
