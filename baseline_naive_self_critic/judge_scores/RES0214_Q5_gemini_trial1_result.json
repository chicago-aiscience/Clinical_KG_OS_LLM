  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the primary and secondary diagnoses and the role of each epidemiological factor (husband's illness, limited contact, and lack of vaccination). It accurately reflects the doctor's prioritization of COVID-19. However, it incorrectly cites [P-27] for the flu shot status (the correct citation is [P-53]).",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all three key epidemiological factors requested in the question and detailed in the Gold Answer: the husband's week-long illness, the shared household/limited contact (work from home/hiking), and the lack of a flu shot.",
    "faithfulness": "The response includes a minor hallucination by referencing a 'clinical knowledge graph [KG]' which is not present in the source transcript. Additionally, it provides an incorrect citation for the vaccination status [P-27], which actually refers to neck swelling in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing how each specific factor mentioned in the prompt shapes the differential diagnosis."
