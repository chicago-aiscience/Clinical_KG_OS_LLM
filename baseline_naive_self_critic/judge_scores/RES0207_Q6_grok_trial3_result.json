  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer incorrectly claims the transcript ends at [P-26] with no further discussion, but the full transcript continues to [D-38], where the doctor explicitly outlines next steps in [D-37] (discussing with another doctor, coming back shortly, possible tests). This is a major factual error contradicting the Gold Answer's accurate summary.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: doctor will review with another doctor [D-37], collaborative decision-making, return shortly to discuss next steps/tests/management [D-37,D-38], no specific tests ordered. Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying any information exists.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript ends at [P-26] ('no subsequent turns'), but verifiable transcript includes [D-27] to [D-38] with direct quotes on next steps; citations are inaccurate and claims ungrounded.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly addresses the question by explaining why it cannot answer (alleged lack of transcript info), with no off-topic content or tangents."
