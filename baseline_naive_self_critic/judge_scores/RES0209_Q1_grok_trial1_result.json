  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the dry cough (nonstop daytime, P-1), shortness of breath (P-1), wheezing a lot (P-15), and daytime vs. nighttime frequency (more frequent daytime, every other day or so at night, P-18), consistent with Gold. However, it omits key Gold details: cough duration (~2 weeks, P-13), confirmation of dry/non-productive (D-15/P-14), 'hard time breathing' during episodes (P-19), wheezing more frequent than bronchodilator use (P-17), and chest tightness (P-20). Minor discrepancy in attributing cold air worsening specifically to cough (P-11 refers generally to symptoms). Some factual omissions but core symptoms and main point correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) dry cough ~2 weeks, nonstop day (P-1/13/14); 2) SOB very short, hard breathing episodes esp severe wheeze (P-1/16/19); 3) wheezing a lot, > bronchodilator use (P-15/17); 4) chest tightness (P-20); 5) daytime prominent/constant vs nighttime less frequent every other/2 days (P-1/18). Covered: dry cough nonstop day, SOB, wheezing a lot, freq difference. Missed: duration 2 weeks, hard breathing detail, wheezing vs reliever, chest tightness. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims verifiable in transcript with accurate citations: cough dry/nonstop (P-1), cold worsens (P-9/11), SOB (P-1), bronchodilator helps/more use (P-1), wheezing (P-15), freq (P-18), gym trigger via reliever use (P-9). 'Immediately during gym' slightly interpretive (P-9 says 'right after run around after gym'), cold specifically for cough plausible but general in transcript. No hallucinations, minor unverifiable interpretations.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by listing specific symptoms (cough character, SOB/breathing, wheezing) with details and day/night frequency differences; structured response directly focused, no off-topic content."
