  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the frequency of diarrhea episodes and number of vomiting episodes are not specified, when P-28 clearly states 'five or six times a day' for diarrhea and P-32 states 'I vomited two times' for vomiting. It also incorrectly states the headache severity was not numerically rated, when P-8 clearly states '7' on a 10-point scale. These are major factual errors contradicting the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses critical information. It fails to mention: the timeline of symptom onset (headache/cough 4 days ago, diarrhea 2 days ago), the specific diarrhea frequency (5-6 times/day), the specific number of vomiting episodes (2), the headache severity rating (7/10), headache location (forehead and top of head, bilateral), loss of smell, fatigue, and important negative findings (no blood in stool/vomit, no shortness of breath, no wheezing, no chest pain, etc.). It covers less than 50% of the key points from the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer makes claims that are contradicted by the transcript. It states information is 'not specified' when it clearly is specified in the transcript (diarrhea frequency at P-28, vomiting episodes at P-32, headache severity at P-8). This represents hallucination through omission of verifiable facts and false claims about missing information.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the question but provides incomplete and partially incorrect information. While it attempts to cover the requested categories (GI symptoms, respiratory symptoms, cough nature, diarrhea frequency, vomiting episodes, headache severity), the execution is flawed with missing or incorrect details for most of these categories."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's scope but contains major factual errors and significant omissions. It incorrectly claims that diarrhea frequency, vomiting episodes, and headache severity are not specified when they are clearly documented in the transcript. It misses critical details including specific frequencies, timelines, symptom locations, and important negative findings that are present in the Gold Answer. The response demonstrates poor faithfulness to the source material by making false claims about missing information."
