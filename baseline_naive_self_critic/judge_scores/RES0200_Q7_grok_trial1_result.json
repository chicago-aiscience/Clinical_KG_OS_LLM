  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer has factual errors compared to the Gold Answer: it omits the 10-year duration of the chronic cough specified in [P-3] and instead vaguely states 'for a while' based only on [P-1]; it reports COPD diagnosis as 'a couple years ago' from [P-1] without the clarification to 'almost, probably five years ago' in [P-2] as emphasized in Gold; correctly identifies cough worsening and sputum change to yellow over the last week [P-1, P-5, P-6]; correctly notes acute shortness of breath intensification in the last few days [P-1, P-8]. These omissions and lack of clarification represent significant discrepancies on key timeline elements.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: chronic cough ~10 years [P-3] (missed); COPD diagnosis ~5 years with clarification [P-1,P-2] (partially covered but inaccurate); cough worsening and sputum change to yellow ~1 week [P-1,P-5,P-6] (covered); acute SOB intensification last few days [P-1,P-8] (covered); additional details like baseline intermittent SOB [P-8] and chills last couple days [P-29] (missed). Covers the structure and two main recent events fully, but misses or partially covers the early timeline points, approximately 50-60% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: chronic cough in [P-1]; COPD 'couple years' in [P-1]; cough worsening last week [P-1]; sputum change [P-6]; SOB last few days [P-8]. No hallucinations or fabricated content; selective use of transcript but grounded where stated.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by structuring the response as a timeline with bullet points precisely matching the four specific timeline elements asked (chronic cough onset, COPD diagnosis, cough worsening/sputum change, acute SOB intensification), with no off-topic content."
