  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. Most critically, it incorrectly states the pain occurs 'only during episodes of anxiety attacks' citing [P-20], when P-20 actually discusses heart fluttering during anxiety attacks, not chest pain. The transcript clearly shows pain occurs while walking to school and studying alone [P-4], and resolves when engaged with others [P-9, P-29]. The Generated Answer also misses the key characteristic that pain occurs at rest [D-11, P-11] and the complete description of when it resolves.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers only about 40% of key points from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies quality (sharp/strong), deep breath trigger, and 20-minute duration. However, it completely omits: the initial description as 'uncomfortable' and 'odd' [P-2], intermittent nature ('here and there') [P-7], specific situations (walking to school, studying alone) [P-4, P-29], resolution patterns (when talking to people, hands-on tasks) [P-9, P-29], occurrence at rest [D-11], no worsening with exercise [P-10], no preceding injury [P-5], and first-time occurrence [P-17].",
    "faithfulness": "The answer contains a major hallucination. The claim that pain occurs 'only during episodes of anxiety attacks' directly contradicts the transcript. P-20 discusses heart fluttering during anxiety attacks, not chest pain. The patient explicitly states pain occurs while walking to school and studying [P-4, P-29], not during anxiety attacks. While other details are verifiable (sharp quality, deep breath trigger, 20-minute duration, medication failure), this critical error significantly undermines faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The answer is moderately relevant, addressing the question about pain characteristics but with significant gaps. It provides quality, duration, and some situational context. However, the incorrect focus on anxiety attacks rather than the actual situations (walking alone, studying) makes a substantial portion less relevant. The treatment response information, while accurate, was not requested in the question about pain characteristics."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates poor performance across all evaluation dimensions. It contains a critical factual error by incorrectly stating pain occurs only during anxiety attacks, when the transcript clearly indicates pain occurs while walking to school and studying alone, resolving when engaged with others. The answer covers less than half of the key points from the Gold Answer, omitting crucial details about the intermittent nature, specific situations of occurrence/resolution, occurrence at rest, and lack of exercise exacerbation. The major hallucination about anxiety attacks significantly undermines faithfulness. While the answer addresses the general question topic and some details are accurate (sharp quality, 20-minute duration), the substantial errors and omissions result in an overall weak evaluation with an average score of 2.25/5."
