  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the specific medication for reflux is not mentioned and that no change to the regimen is described. However, the transcript explicitly mentions 'Tums' [P-27] and the patient states he stopped his previous medication because he 'figured out the foods that were going to help' [P-27]. It correctly identifies Avodart for prostate enlargement.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key components from the Gold Answer: 1) It fails to identify Tums as a current medication. 2) It fails to describe the change (discontinuing the previous medication). 3) It fails to provide the reason for the change (dietary management).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript does not contain information about the reflux medication change or the specific medication name, which is factually contradicted by turn [P-27] in the source text. This is a failure to extract available information.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses the prompts but fails to provide the required information due to an inability to locate the relevant section of the transcript, leading to 'I don't know' style responses for two-thirds of the question."
