  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The answer correctly states onset 4–5 days ago and identifies exertion (playing tag) as the initial trigger, and notes a new slight cough developing after initial wheeze/SOB. However, it introduces an incorrect causal link between the current fluctuating episodes and prior “viral infections” over 2 years (the transcript describes past viral URIs but does not connect them to the current episode pattern). Most importantly, it incorrectly claims the transcript contains no information about a nocturnal episode; the transcript explicitly describes one night with wheeziness that resolved and caused trouble falling asleep. These are significant errors relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) onset 4–5 days, (2) initial trigger exertion, (3) fluctuating pattern, (4) cough emerged later, (5) cold weather worsens (present in transcript though not central in Gold).\nKey points missed: (a) earliest symptoms included difficulty taking deep breaths, (b) episodes resolve on their own and recur with activity, improve with rest, (c) cough is non-productive/no phlegm, (d) single nocturnal wheezy episode with trouble falling asleep (explicitly denied), (e) pertinent negatives (no fever, no cyanosis, child otherwise well between attacks). Overall coverage is well under 80% and misses several core elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple statements are not grounded or are misleading: linking the fluctuating pattern to prior viral infections is not supported; references to an external “knowledge graph” are not part of the transcript; and the denial of nocturnal symptoms directly contradicts the transcript (P-43–P-44). Some elements are grounded (onset timing, exertional trigger, cold weather worse, slight cough), but there are multiple unfaithful components.",
    "relevance": "The response is mostly aimed at describing symptom development (trigger, fluctuation, cough, nocturnal episode), which matches the question. However, it includes tangential/unsupported discussion about prior viral infections and a “knowledge graph,” and it fails the nocturnal component. Still, the content is largely within the respiratory-symptom timeline scope."
