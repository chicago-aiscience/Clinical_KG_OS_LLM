  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the COVID swab order and the stated turnaround time (24–48 hours), the 14-day isolation recommendation including separation from the younger sister if possible, the clinician’s statement that symptoms align with COVID/infection, the acknowledgement of possible false negatives, the alternative explanation of another circulating viral illness if negative, and the ER warning signs (high temperature, neurologic symptoms مثل seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting). Minor overstatement: it labels isolation as “strict,” whereas the transcript states “isolate for 14 days” and “includes from his younger sister possible.” No other factual conflicts with the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Captures most key elements from the Gold Answer: test + turnaround, isolation duration + household note, false negatives, alternative viral illness, and ER return precautions with examples. It omits the additional differential point in D-45: if cough/SOB without fever, asthma would be added. It also does not explicitly state “no medications” / “watchful waiting,” which is included in the Gold Answer summary (though partially implied by waiting for results). Overall coverage is high but not complete.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by D-44 and D-45. The added phrasing “strict” and the mention of a “knowledge graph” are not in the transcript; “strict” is a slight interpretive embellishment rather than a new clinical fact. Otherwise, no major hallucinated content.",
    "relevance": "The response is tightly focused on the asked components (assessment, test + TAT, isolation, alternative diagnosis if negative, false negatives, and ER warning signs with examples) and avoids irrelevant tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely accurate, well-grounded, and directly responsive, but it misses the asthma differential note (and the explicit watchful-waiting/no-meds aspect) and adds minor unsupported emphasis (\"strict\")."
