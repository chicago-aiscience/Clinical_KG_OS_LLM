  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies the condition placed lower on the differential as a “cardiac ischemic picture/cardiac ischemia” (matches D-36).\n- Correctly reports the clinician’s reasoning that symptoms were more “tightness” than “pain,” and that absence of pain contributed to lowering ischemia on the differential (matches D-36, P-5).\n- However, it adds an inaccurate/overstated claim: “no pain rules out cardiac ischemia.” The transcript does not state that ischemia is ruled out—only that it is lower on the differential. Clinically, absence of chest pain does not categorically rule out ischemia.\n- It also does not mention the clinician’s specific point that the patient “didn’t really get out of breath with exercise” (D-36) as part of the rationale (an omission rather than an error).",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points:\n1) Condition: cardiac ischemic picture lowered (covered).\n2) Nature of complaint: tightness rather than pain (covered).\n3) Dyspnea/exertional pattern: doctor said not really out of breath with exercise (missed).\n4) Pertinent negatives: denied anxiety/sweating/impending doom (missed).\nOverall, it captures some central evidence (tightness/no pain) but misses multiple specific symptom findings highlighted in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "- Statements about chest tightness and lack of pain are grounded in the transcript (P-1, P-5, D-36).\n- The added “knowledge graph” and the asserted rule “no pain — rules out — cardiac ischemia” are not present in the transcript and introduce an unsupported, overly definitive inference.\n- Therefore, the answer is only partially grounded, with a notable hallucinated/unsupported element.",
    "relevance": "- Directly answers what condition was deprioritized and provides symptom-based justification.\n- No major irrelevant tangents; content stays focused on the differential and cited symptoms."
