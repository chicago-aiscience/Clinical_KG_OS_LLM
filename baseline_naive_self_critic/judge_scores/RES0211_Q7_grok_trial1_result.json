  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer accurately cites P-4 where patient explicitly states 'I first noticed that my throat was kind of scratchy and then I started coughing,' establishing order, and details feeling hot persistently (P-7, P-9); Generated Answer incorrectly claims no explicit chronological order and denies any mention of feeling hot or fever-like symptoms despite clear transcript evidence, introducing significant factual contradictions with Gold Answer on core symptom sequence and hot sensation.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 3-4 day duration, first scratchy throat then dry cough (P-4), headache (P-1/P-2), malaise (P-1/P-14), fatigue (P-13), persistent hot feeling day/night (P-7/P-9), no exact hot timing but same illness, doctor notes fever (D-58), progression from local to systemic; Generated covers only duration and cough/throat symptoms (<20% coverage), misses order, progression, headache, malaise, fatigue, and entirely omits hot sensation details.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated misrepresents transcript: denies explicit order despite P-4 ('first noticed throat... then coughing'), denies hot feeling despite P-7 ('felt really hot'), P-9 ('hot all the time... day and night'); these are direct quotes, so claims are not verifiable and fabricate absences, with multiple inaccuracies indicating poor grounding.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly engages question by addressing symptom duration, cough/throat order (albeit incorrectly claiming unspecified), and hot sensation relation (incorrectly denying presence), with no irrelevant tangents or off-topic content."
