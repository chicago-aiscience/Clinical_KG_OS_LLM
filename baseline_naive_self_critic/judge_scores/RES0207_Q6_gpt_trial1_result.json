  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect compared with the Gold Answer. The transcript clearly includes the end-of-consultation next steps at D-37/D-38 (reviewing with the doctor working today, returning shortly to discuss next steps, possible tests, and plan to move forward). The Generated Answer wrongly claims the transcript ends at P-26 and that no follow-up discussion is present, directly contradicting the provided Source Transcript and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers none of the Gold Answer’s key points: (1) reviewing the case with the supervising/working doctor, (2) collaborative decision-making, (3) returning shortly to discuss next steps, (4) mention of possible tests and deciding how to move forward, (5) no specific tests/treatments named, and (6) closing/farewell. Instead, it states the information is unavailable.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is not grounded in the provided transcript. It asserts the transcript ends at P-26 and that there are no subsequent doctor turns, which is false given the transcript continues through D-38. This is a major unfaithful claim about the source content (effectively a fabrication/omission of existing text).",
    "relevance": "It attempts to address the question by commenting on inability to determine next steps, but because this is based on an incorrect reading of the transcript and fails to provide the requested next-step details, it is largely unhelpful to the user’s query."
