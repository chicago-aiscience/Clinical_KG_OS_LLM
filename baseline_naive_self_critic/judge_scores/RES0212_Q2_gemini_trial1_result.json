  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate regarding the patient's eczema treatment (regular moisturizing cream vs. previously prescribed medicated cream). However, it neglects the patient's explicit statement that she is 'taking no medications' [P-29] in a general sense, which the gold answer highlights as a primary fact.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is significantly incomplete. It focuses exclusively on eczema and misses several key components covered in the gold answer: the general 'no' to current medications [P-29], the use of condoms for contraception [P-45], substance use (marijuana vape and alcohol) [P-36, P-41], and the absence of medications for her current cough symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims made about the moisturizing creams and the previous prescription from Shoppers Drug Mart are directly supported by the transcript [P-23]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it narrow-mindedly focuses on eczema. The question asked for 'medications or treatments' in general, but the response self-limited the scope, ignoring contraception and substance use which were addressed in the gold answer and transcript."
