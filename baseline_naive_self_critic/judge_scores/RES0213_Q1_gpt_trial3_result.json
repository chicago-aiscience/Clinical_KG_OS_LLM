  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the pain quality as “very sharp, strong” and that it is associated with deep breaths (P-3), and that episodes last about ~20 minutes (P-6/P-7). However, it contains a major factual error: it claims the chest pain is felt “only during episodes of anxiety attacks” and not otherwise, citing P-20. In the transcript, P-20 refers to heart fluttering during anxiety attacks, not the chest pain; the patient reports chest pain mainly when alone walking/studying and less noticeable when engaged with others (P-9, P-29). This substantially contradicts the consultation and the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: (1) sharp/strong quality, (2) deep-breath association, (3) ~20-minute episodes. Key elements missed: (1) symptom duration of ~1.5 weeks, (2) initial description as uncomfortable/odd (not exactly “pain”), (3) intermittent “here and there” recurrence rather than constant, (4) typical contexts of occurrence (walking to school; sitting/studying alone; at rest), (5) improvement/going unnoticed when talking to people/at school/doing tasks, (6) not worse with exercise, (7) no injury and no prior similar episodes. Overall coverage is well under 50% of the Gold Answer’s key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are grounded (sharp/strong; deep breath; 20 minutes; OTC meds not helping). The central situational claim (pain only during anxiety attacks) is not supported by the transcript and results from misreading P-20 (which is about palpitations/fluttering). This is a significant ungrounded/incorrect claim relative to the transcript, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at describing quality, duration, and context, so it is on-topic. However, it introduces an incorrect situational characterization (anxiety-only) and adds some extra details (treatment response, broader stress context) that are not required for the question. Because it partially answers but distorts a key part (when it occurs vs resolves), relevance is only partial."

  "summary": "The answer includes some correct basic descriptors (sharp, pleuritic, ~20-minute episodes) but misses most key context and contains a major unfaithful error by incorrectly stating the pain occurs only with anxiety attacks."
