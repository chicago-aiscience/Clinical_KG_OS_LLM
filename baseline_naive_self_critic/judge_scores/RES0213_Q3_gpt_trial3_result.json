  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer’s diagnosis is **anxiety-related/stress-induced chest pain** (panic/anxiety spectrum), supported by a clear pattern of symptoms occurring when alone/thinking and improving with distraction/social engagement, plus anxiety history and current stress.\n\nThe Generated Answer instead concludes **Conversion Disorder / Psychogenic Pain Disorder**, which is **not the diagnosis indicated by the Gold Answer** and is not well-supported by the transcript. While it is directionally “psychological/functional,” conversion disorder specifically implies neurological-type symptoms (or other conversion features) and the explanation about symptoms as a “displaced expression of conflict” is not grounded here. Thus, the core diagnostic conclusion is incorrect relative to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer support that *is* included:\n- Past anxiety attacks as a teenager (P-21).\n- Current academic stress (P-13).\n- Some mention of social-context dependence (partially via P-20, though the strongest citations would be P-9 and P-29).\n\nKey Gold Answer support that is **missing or not adequately addressed**:\n- The central situational pattern with correct supporting quotes: occurs when alone walking/studying and resolves with distraction/social interaction/hands-on tasks (P-4, P-9, P-29).\n- Explicit acknowledgment that anxiety attacks might return (P-22).\n- Thesis deadline/time crunch stress details (P-15, P-16).\n- Episode physiology: “makes herself nervous” and “starts breathing faster,” difficulty getting deep breath due to nervousness (P-19).\n- Patient explicitly considering stress as a cause (P-8).\n- Pertinent negatives favoring anxiety over organic disease: no fever (P-12), not worse with exertion (P-10), occurs at rest (D-11/P-11), no palpitations except with anxiety attacks (P-20), no asthma (P-23/P-24).\n\nOverall, it captures only a minority of the specific supporting observations emphasized in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements go beyond the transcript and/or misattribute support:\n- References to a “knowledge graph” are not part of the provided transcript.\n- Claiming the symptom acts as a “displaced expression of conflict” or to “gain attention” is not stated or supported.\n- Saying lack of response to Tylenol/Advil “rules out” organic pain is not justified by the transcript and is a clinical overreach.\n- The answer cites P-20 for social-context relief, but P-20 is about palpitations during anxiety attacks; the strongest evidence for relief with distraction is in P-9 and P-29.\n\nThese amount to multiple ungrounded or over-interpreted assertions, reducing faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response attempts to answer both parts of the question (a diagnosis and supporting consultation observations) and stays mostly on-topic. However, it selects an incorrect diagnosis relative to the Gold Answer and includes some tangential/unsupported psychodynamic framing. Still, it is generally aimed at the requested clinical reasoning task."
