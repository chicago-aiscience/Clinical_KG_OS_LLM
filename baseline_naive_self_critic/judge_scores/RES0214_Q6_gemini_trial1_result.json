  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the COVID-19 swab and the isolation requirements. However, it incorrectly identifies the 'immediate next step' as the administration of the swab, whereas the transcript [D-52] explicitly states the next step is a physical exam. It also mentions ruling out influenza as a 'next step' when it was discussed as a diagnostic possibility rather than a procedural next step.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses two significant components of the doctor's plan mentioned in the gold answer: the physical examination [D-52] and the consultation with the supervising physician ('talk to the Doctor') before returning [D-55]. It covers approximately 50% of the key points regarding the management plan and next steps.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims made in the generated answer are grounded in the transcript text, such as the COVID swab and self-isolation instructions. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the prompt's questions about the test, precautions, and next steps, although it omits parts of the clinical workflow."
