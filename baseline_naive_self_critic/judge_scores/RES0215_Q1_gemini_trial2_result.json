  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms at presentation (wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and difficulty taking deep breaths). However, it identifies only 'wheezy' as the earliest symptom. According to P-2 in the transcript (and noted in the Gold Answer), the mother identified both 'wheezy' and 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' as the symptoms she noticed first. The Generated Answer's reasoning for choosing 'wheezy' relies on P-1, whereas P-2 specifically answers the doctor's question about what was noticed first.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is significantly less detailed than the Gold Answer. It misses several key points: the specific context of the shortness of breath (playing tag), the mother's denial of cyanosis (turning blue), the non-productive nature of the cough (no phlegm), and the fact that 'difficulty taking deep breaths' was also an initial symptom. It covers about 50-60% of the information provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All symptoms listed and the timeline reasoning are directly supported by statements in [P-1] and [P-2]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and specifically addresses both parts of the user's question without any irrelevant content."
