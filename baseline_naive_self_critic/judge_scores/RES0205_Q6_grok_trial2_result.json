  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the physical exam components (listening to heart and lungs plus quick physical exam) and the multi-step process (consult colleague, review discussion, return to discuss next steps) as stated in [D-37], matching the Gold Answer's core facts with only minor paraphrasing differences (e.g., 'plan for the future' vs. 'where to go from here'), no contradictions or errors.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: multi-step plan at end [D-37], specific physical exam components (heart/lungs auscultation and quick physical exam), detailed collaborative process (consult supervising doctor, review everything discussed, return to discuss next steps). Minor points missed: foreshadowing in [D-1], patient agreement [P-37], note on no diagnosis/meds and trainee context; however, these are supplementary, and core plan elements are 100% covered.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-37]: 'quick listen to your heart and lungs', 'quick physical exam', 'go get the doctor that I'm working with', 'go over everything you talked about', 'we'll come back and talk to you about where to go from here'. No hallucinations; paraphrases are accurate and grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring response around 'Physical Examination Components' and 'Process for Determining Next Steps' from the end of the consultation [D-37], with no off-topic content."
