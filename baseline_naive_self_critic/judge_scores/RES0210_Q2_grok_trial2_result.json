  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states Lipitor for high cholesterol (from P-25/P-26), confirmed as only prescribed med (P-27); Tylenol OTC for symptom relief related to feverish/unwell feeling, helps 'a little bit' (P-14). Generated correctly identifies Lipitor for cholesterol (minor discrepancy: 'high' omitted but core fact matches transcript/P-25) and Tylenol with correct effectiveness quote. However, significant error: attributes Tylenol to cough relief via hallucinated 'knowledge graph', contradicting Gold's fever/symptom relief and transcript context (Tylenol mentioned amid overall symptoms including fever, not specifically cough; Tylenol not a cough remedy). Thus, some factual errors but main meds and OTC effectiveness correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: Lipitor (atorvastatin) for high cholesterol; only med confirmed; Tylenol OTC for feverish/unwell symptoms, 'helps a little bit'; no others; notes on non-med relief, allergies, etc. Generated covers Lipitor/condition, Tylenol OTC/condition/effectiveness (~80%: core meds/OTC details hit, but wrong Tylenol condition, omits 'atorvastatin' name, 'only med' confirmation, no-other-meds emphasis, extra Gold details).",
    "faithfulness": "Cites P-26/P-14 accurate for mentions. Lipitor-cholesterol grounded in P-25/P-26. Tylenol effectiveness quote exact. Hallucinations: Entire 'knowledge graph' fabricated (no such entity in transcript); Tylenol 'relieves cough' not in transcript (context is general symptom relief post-fever mention, Tylenol treats fever/pain not cough); graph syntax [TREATMENT] etc. invented. Multiple unverifiable/hallucinated claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly lists prescribed (Lipitor) and OTC (Tylenol) meds with conditions and OTC effectiveness in structured format matching question; no tangents or off-topic content."
