  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer precisely details baseline bronchodilator use as 'once every two weeks' (P-8), which Generated omits and vaguely references as 'previous baseline' or 'less frequently'; current exacerbation duration is 'past two weeks' (P-13 clarification), but Generated uses 'past week' (P-1); misses wheezing exceeding bronchodilator use (P-16/17), chest tightness (P-20), and no precipitant; incorrectly lists goldfish as trigger (P-39 only mentions ownership, not causation); core evolution from infrequent to frequent use and worsening symptoms is correct, but with notable omissions and errors.",
    "completeness": "Covers: diagnosis age 8/now 10, current cough/SOB/wheezing/nighttime symptoms, increased bronchodilator to near-daily, triggers (exercise/cold/pollen). Misses: exact baseline frequency 'once every two weeks', 2-week clarification, wheezing > use frequency, chest tightness, no infection precipitant. Adds extraneous family history and goldfish. Covers ~60-70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: ages (D-3), symptoms (P-1,15,18,19), triggers exercise/cold/spring (P-9,11), increased use (P-1,8 implied). Hallucinates goldfish as 'potential trigger' (P-39 only states ownership, no link to symptoms); baseline frequency vaguely implied but not directly cited/quoted accurately; minor overstatements like 'continuous' from 'almost nonstop' ok. Some hallucinated details.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses evolution of symptoms and bronchodilator use over time with structured timeline; minor tangents include family history and incorrect goldfish trigger, but core focus matches question on diagnosis, baseline to exacerbation progression."
