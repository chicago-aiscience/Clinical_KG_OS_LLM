  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer diagnoses acute lower respiratory tract infection (acute bronchitis with possible bacterial superinfection or early CAP on chronic cough), accurately explaining each feature with transcript support: productive cough (3 days acute on 3 months chronic), greenish sputum (infectious etiology), subjective nighttime fevers (systemic response). Generated Answer diagnoses Bacterial Pneumonia or Acute Bacterial Bronchitis (partial overlap but adds pneumonia without support, ignores chronic cough); misstates cough as ~1 month (vs. 3 days acute/3 months), ignores fevers [P-4] and claims none explicit (contradiction), substitutes fatigue/sleep issues, hallucinates 'Knowledge Graph'. Significant factual errors and contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: specific diagnosis with chronic context, precise cough timeline [P-2,P-12], sputum as suggestive [P-9], fevers [P-4], doctor's summary [D-47], absent symptoms. Generated covers partial diagnosis, sputum, cough (inaccurately), but misses fevers entirely (uses fatigue instead), chronic cough context, doctor's synthesis, absences. Covers ~30-40% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated mis-cites durations ([P-1,P-19] imply month but contradicts [P-2,P-12]'s 3 months/3 days); denies fevers despite [P-4] 'feeling hot at night'; adds unverified 'Knowledge Graph' and strong bacterial specificity not directly in transcript; fatigue/sleep [P-19,P-20] present but not substitute for fevers. Multiple inaccuracies and hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around diagnosis and three features (cough, sputum, 'fever' via proxy), addressing question format despite errors; minor tangent with Knowledge Graph and fatigue."
