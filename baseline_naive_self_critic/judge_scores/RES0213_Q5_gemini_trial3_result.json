{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with the gold answer regarding the main points: the father's heart attack, the patient's smoking habit, and the presence of school-related stress. However, it omits several specific details such as the father's age (50s), the paternal grandfather's accidental death, and the specific nature of the patient's degree (Masters of Social Work).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures the broad categories but misses many specific 'details from the consultation' requested by the prompt and present in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it misses: the father seeing heart doctors, the grandfather's history, the specific smoking timeline (starting at 18, 10/day for 2 years), the thesis deadline, living alone in London, being nervous about running, and the specific physical interaction of breathing faster during episodes.",
    "faithfulness": "The response cites the transcript correctly for several points (P-8, P-14, P-13, P-20, P-3). However, it repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' as a source of evidence and classification, which was not provided in the prompt or transcript. This constitutes a hallucination of the available source material.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, structuring its response to directly address each part of the multipart question (family history, smoking, psychosocial stressors, and their interactions)."
