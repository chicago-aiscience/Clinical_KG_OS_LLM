  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the core clinical findings in the gold answer. It correctly identifies the bronchodilator as the sole medication and recognizes the absence of a daily controller medication.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer addresses all three parts of the question. However, it is slightly less complete than the gold answer because it fails to mention the specific phrasing the doctor used to describe the daily controller ('one that you take every day no matter what') and the specific term 'puffer' used in the transcript to describe administration.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is grounded in the transcript. However, the generated answer cites [P-1] for the administration method as an 'inhaler'. While technically correct, P-1 only mentions 'bronchodilator'; the administration device 'puffer' is explicitly mentioned later in the transcript (D-7, P-7). Additionally, the word 'inhaler' does not appear in the transcript itself (only 'puffer' and 'bronchodilator').",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and directly answers the question without including extraneous information."
