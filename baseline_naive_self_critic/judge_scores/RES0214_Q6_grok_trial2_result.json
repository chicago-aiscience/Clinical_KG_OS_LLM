  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the COVID-19 swab order and self-isolation recommendation with correct citations matching the Gold Answer and transcript [D-53, D-54]. However, it inaccurately frames the 'immediate next step' as the swab administration (not explicitly stated as immediate in transcript; physical exam is next per [D-52]) and lists 'social distancing' separately from isolation (a minor interpretive stretch). Core facts align with Gold, but minor discrepancies exist in next steps presentation.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) COVID-19 swab ordered - covered; (2) self-isolation for patient and husband - fully covered; (3) physical exam as next step - missed; (4) consult with supervising doctor and return - missed; (5) patient agreement - not covered. Covers ~50-60% of key points (test and precautions fully, next steps partially/inaccurately).",
    "faithfulness": "All major claims (swab ordered, self-isolate patient/husband, keep to self, consider flu) are directly verifiable in transcript [D-53, D-54] with accurate citations. Minor issues: 'social distancing' not verbatim (implied in self-isolation); 'immediate next step: administration and ordering of swab' not precise (physical exam stated as next [D-52], swab timing unspecified); 'ruling out influenza after COVID' plausible but not explicitly sequenced. Mostly grounded, minor unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around the question's elements (test ordered, precautionary measures for patient/husband, next steps), using bullet points matching the query; no off-topic content, perfectly focused despite omissions."
