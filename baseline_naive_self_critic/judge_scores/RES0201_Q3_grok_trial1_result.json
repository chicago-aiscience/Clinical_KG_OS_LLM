  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies a specific combination of symptoms (progressively worsening sore throat, new-onset constant and worsening difficulty breathing, persistent reduced sense of taste, and fatigue with muscle aches) as leading to the doctor's suspicion of COVID-19 [D-43], with details on reduced taste without loss of smell [P-19, D-19]. The Generated Answer only explicitly covers sore throat and reduced taste, vaguely referencing 'other symptoms,' omitting critical dyspnea and fatigue/myalgias; it also misinterprets [P-19] by claiming olfactory function is affected ('not smell' means no loss of smell, not affected smell); additionally, it fabricates a 'medical knowledge graph' not present in the transcript. These represent significant factual errors and omissions compared to the Gold Answer, warranting a score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: doctor's explicit statement [D-43]; sore throat details [P-2,P-4]; dyspnea details [P-8,P-9,P-10]; reduced taste details [P-19,P-20,P-21]; screening for taste/smell [D-19]; fatigue/myalgias [P-25,P-26]; exposure risks [P-12,P-13,P-14]. Generated covers doctor's statement, sore throat, and partial taste details (~25-30% coverage), missing dyspnea (major symptom), fatigue/myalgias, screening specifics, and exposure context, scoring 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated claims are partially grounded (sore throat [P-2,P-6], taste [P-19], doctor's statement [D-43]), but misreads [P-19] as smell affected (hallucination, as 'not smell' means intact smell); introduces entirely fabricated 'Knowledge Graph' with specific symptom-diagnosis links not in transcript; multiple hallucinated elements reduce grounding, scoring 2.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses the question by identifying symptoms (sore throat, reduced taste) leading to suspicion and discussing taste vs. smell interpretation tied to doctor's reasoning [D-43], but includes off-topic hallucinated KG section; partially relevant with some extraneous content, scoring 3."
