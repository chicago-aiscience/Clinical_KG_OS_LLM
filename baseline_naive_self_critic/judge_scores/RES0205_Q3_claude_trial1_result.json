  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated and accurately states the test was negative. All factual claims align with the Gold Answer and source transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the main elements: diagnosis (COVID-19), key evidence (persistent cough, flu-like symptoms, hospital worker status, colleague concerns), and test result (negative). However, it omits some details present in the Gold Answer: specific timeline of test (two weeks ago at symptom onset), patient staying home since testing, mention of PPE use, whitish/clear mucus description, and the transition from productive to dry cough timeline. Covers approximately 70% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations. The answer appropriately references P-2, P-14, P-34, and P-35. No hallucinated content detected. The characterization of evidence is grounded in actual patient statements.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses all three parts of the question: what diagnosis was investigated (COVID-19), what evidence prompted it (persistent cough, flu-like symptoms, hospital worker status, colleague concerns), and what testing revealed (negative result). Highly focused with no irrelevant content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately identifies COVID-19 as the investigated diagnosis with a negative result, and provides relevant evidence including the persistent cough, flu-like symptoms, and hospital worker context. All information is factually correct and grounded in the transcript. However, it lacks some details present in the Gold Answer such as the specific testing timeline (two weeks ago at symptom onset), the patient's subsequent home isolation, PPE usage, and more detailed symptom progression. The response is highly relevant and contains no errors or hallucinations."
