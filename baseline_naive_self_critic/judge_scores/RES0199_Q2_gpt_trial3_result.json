  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated answer correctly identifies Tylenol (acetaminophen) as the at-home medication and correctly links it to headache relief (supported by P-3/P-4). It accurately lists the doctor’s supportive-care recommendations (hydration, nutritious food, sleep) and OTC medication guidance (Tylenol for fever; Tylenol/NSAIDs for myalgias/arthralgias) consistent with D-52. No factual contradictions with the Gold Answer are present.",
    "completeness": "Covers: (1) Tylenol taken at home, (2) symptom targeted = headache, (3) supportive measures: hydration/nutritious food/sleep, (4) Tylenol for fever, (5) Tylenol or NSAIDs for aches.\nMisses key Gold Answer elements: (a) COVID-19 swab testing ordered, (b) instruction to isolate for 14 days while awaiting results/possible public health contact tracing if positive, (c) patient’s self-initiated supportive measure of trying to keep hydrated (not essential to the question but included in Gold). Overall ~70–80% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All substantive clinical claims are directly supported by the transcript (P-3/P-4; D-52). The mention of a 'knowledge graph' is extraneous and not in the transcript, but it does not introduce new clinical facts. No clear hallucinated medications or interventions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses what was taken at home, what symptom it targeted, and what additional meds/supportive measures were recommended. Minor omission of COVID testing/isolation affects completeness more than relevance; content remains on-topic."
