  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the three components from the prompt. However, it incorrectly attributes the persistent cough to 're-exposure' or 'lack of recovery time' due to the patient's work environment. The transcript explicitly states the patient has been at home for the past two weeks [P-36], contradicting the claim that the work environment prevented recovery. It also mentions a 'Knowledge Graph' which was not provided in the source material.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers all three specific areas requested in the prompt: acid reflux, hay fever, and occupational exposure. It misses the specific 'post-viral pattern' conclusion drawn in the Gold Answer, though it notes the flu symptoms resolved.",
    "faithfulness": "There is a significant faithfulness issue regarding the occupational exposure. The patient states in [P-36] that they have been home since the symptoms started two weeks ago, yet the generated answer claims their work environment 'prevented the necessary recovery time'. Additionally, it references a 'Knowledge Graph' that is not part of the provided context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and structured specifically to address the three-part question asked by the user."
