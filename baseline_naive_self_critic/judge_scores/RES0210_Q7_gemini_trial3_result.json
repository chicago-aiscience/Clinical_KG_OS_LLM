  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors compared to the Gold Answer and the transcript. It identifies Sunday as the 'Initial Onset' and the start of the raspy cough, whereas the transcript [P-3] and Gold Answer state the cough began on Friday. It also places the onset of chest pain on Wednesday, while the patient noted it 'over the last day' [P-20], which corresponds to Tuesday. It fails to identify Monday as the start of the fever.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is missing several key components of the timeline: it omits the runny nose from a week prior [P-16], misses the specific onset of the fever on Monday [P-8], and neglects the Friday start of the raspy cough [P-3]. It covers only about 40% of the requested symptom-to-day mappings accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer misinterprets the transcript regarding the onset of symptoms. Claiming the illness began on Sunday is a direct contradiction of the patient's statement about Friday. While it correctly identifies the sputum and chills, the overall timeline structure is not grounded in the specific dates provided by the patient.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses the question by attempting to provide a timeline, but it includes irrelevant information about the patient's Lipitor medication [P-26], which is part of their chronic medical history rather than the timeline of the current acute illness."
