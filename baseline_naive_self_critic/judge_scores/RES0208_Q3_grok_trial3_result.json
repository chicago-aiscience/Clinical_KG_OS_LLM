  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer specifies 'fevers and fatigue and muscle aches' as evidence of general infectious process (exact match to Generated). Gold identifies 'difficulty breathing' combined with 'sore throat and cough' as additional distinct symptoms for not ruling out COVID. Generated correctly lists fevers/fatigue/muscle aches for general but incorrectly groups 'difficulty breathing' with the general infection description rather than as additional for COVID, and lists only sore throat/cough for COVID (missing difficulty breathing). This creates a factual discrepancy in categorization and completeness of additional symptoms, though core symptoms are accurate. Score: 3.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) General infectious: fevers, fatigue, muscle aches (fully covered); (2) Additional for COVID: difficulty breathing + sore throat + cough (partially covered - sore throat/cough yes, misses difficulty breathing); (3) D-36 synthesis structure; (4) Taste/smell not explicitly cited; (5) Respiratory focus leading to swab/isolation. Generated covers ~70% (strong on general, partial on additional, no structural notes or extras). Score: 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) directly verifiable in D-36 transcript quote. Citation [D-36] accurate. No unverifiable or hallucinated details; minor interpretive grouping but grounded in doctor's words. Score: 5.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses both parts of question (symptoms for general infectious process; additional symptoms for COVID not ruled out) with focused bullet-like structure, no tangents or off-topic content. Score: 5"
