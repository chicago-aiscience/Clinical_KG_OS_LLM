  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and aligns with the gold answer. It correctly identifies the medication non-adherence and the maternal history of epilepsy as the primary risk factors. It also correctly explains the relationship between family history and the diagnosis as a genetic/hereditary predisposition.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers the main points but lacks some of the specific detail found in the gold answer. Specifically, it does not name the medication (Keppra) or the reason for the missed dose (the daughter's birthday), both of which are included in the gold answer to provide a more comprehensive explanation of the medication-related risk factor.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is well-grounded in the transcript. While it mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not provided, the information extracted (maternal history, missed medication, epilepsy diagnosis) is all present in the source text [P-8, P-9, P-23, P-26].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses both parts of the prompt: the risk factors and the specific relationship between family history and the diagnosis."
