  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript ends at [P-26] with no discussion of next steps, which is factually incorrect as the transcript continues to [D-38]. This directly contradicts the Gold Answer, which accurately details the doctor's communication in [D-37] about reviewing with another doctor, returning shortly, and potential tests or next steps. All core facts are wrong, warranting a score of 1.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer include: doctor will review info with another doctor ([D-37]), collaborative decision-making, return shortly to discuss tests/move forward ([D-37,D-38]), no specific tests ordered, patient agreement ([P-37]). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead denying any such content exists. Score: 1.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates that the transcript 'ends abruptly at [P-26]' and has 'no subsequent turns,' but the provided transcript includes [D-27] through [D-38] with clear next-steps discussion. Claims are unverifiable and contradicted by the transcript, with fabricated content about the transcript's completeness. Score: 1.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly engages the question by explaining why it cannot answer (alleged incomplete transcript) and cites evidence from what it perceives as the end, with no off-topic content or tangents. Perfectly focused on addressing the query about next steps. Score: 5."
