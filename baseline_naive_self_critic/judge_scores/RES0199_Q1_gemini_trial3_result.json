  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several factual errors. It claims the transcript does not specify the frequency of diarrhea, the number of vomiting episodes, or a numerical severity scale for the headache. However, the transcript explicitly states diarrhea occurred 'five or six times a day' [P-28], the patient 'vomited two times' [P-32], and the headache was a '7' on a 1-10 scale [P-8]. Additionally, it categorizes 'headache' under respiratory symptoms, which is clinically inaccurate.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to provide three of the four specific characteristics requested in the prompt (frequency of diarrhea, number of vomiting episodes, and numerical headache severity), despite this information being available in the source text and the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer fails on faithfulness by claiming information is missing from the transcript when it is actually present. This is a negative hallucination/omission that misrepresents the source content.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in terms of its structure, as it attempts to address each part of the user's multi-part question, but the content within those sections is largely incorrect or incomplete."
