  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. It claims that the doctor did not screen for fever, dyspnea (difficulty breathing), or sore throat, and that there were no negative findings documented. However, the transcript explicitly shows the doctor screening for fever (D-10), difficulty breathing (D-11), headaches (D-12), sore throat (D-13), chills/sweats (D-14), muscle aches (D-15), sputum/blood (D-7), triggers (D-21), and chest pain (D-22), all of which the patient confirmed were absent.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to list any of the negative findings requested by the prompt. While it correctly identifies the positive findings (loss of taste/smell, cough), it completely misses the primary objective of the question which was to identify the 'negative findings from the review of systems.'",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It claims the absence of symptoms was 'not discussed or evaluated,' which directly contradicts multiple exchanges in the dialogue (D-10 through D-15, D-22). This constitutes a major hallucination regarding the content of the encounter.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question's core requirements. By asserting that the information does not exist in the transcript, it fails to provide the list of symptoms or the explanation of their clinical significance requested by the user, even though the data was available in the text provided."
