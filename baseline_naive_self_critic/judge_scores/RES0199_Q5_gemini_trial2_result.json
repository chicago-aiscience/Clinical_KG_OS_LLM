  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect and directly contradicts the transcript and the Gold Answer. It claims the doctor did not explore the patient's living situation, workplace, travel history, or sick contacts, whereas the transcript shows the doctor asked about living situation [D-45], environmental triggers [D-46], sick contacts [D-47], workplace [D-48, D-50], and travel [D-49].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses 100% of the key points found in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the apartment living, the car dealership workplace, the denial of travel, or the exploration of sick contacts in the lunchroom.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is unfaithful to the source transcript. It claims that 'No dialogue segments referenced asking about travel plans, the workplace setting, or who the patient may have interacted with,' which is explicitly disproven by segments D-47, D-48, D-49, and D-50.",
    "relevance": "While the answer attempts to address the specific categories mentioned in the question (living, workplace, travel, etc.), it does so by providing a false negative conclusion, rendering it useless for the inquiry."
