  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies key elements like the patient's asthma history [P-16], reduced medication adherence [D-34, P-19], chest tightness worsened by walking [P-1, P-9, D-34], and absence of pain lowering cardiac risk [D-36], aligning with Gold's core facts. Minor discrepancies include emphasizing hoarseness/phlegm [P-11] which Gold omits as non-central, imprecise Salbutamol reference (rescue not daily), and hallucinated 'knowledge graph relationship' not in Gold or transcript. Core reasoning on linking symptoms to asthma recurrence is consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) asthma history [P-16,P-29] covered; (2) medication limiting (skipping evening, no rescue refill) [P-17-19,D-34] partially covered as reduced usage; (3) symptoms (diffuse tightness, exertion SOB) [P-1,7,9,10] partially covered (tightness, SOB, walking); (4) patient notes possible relation [P-16] missed; (5) no env triggers [P-33] missed; (6) absence cardiac indicators [D-36] covered; therapeutic trial [D-35] missed. Covers ~60-70% of points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like symptoms [P-1,P-11], history [P-16,P-25], reduced use [D-34], walking trigger [D-34], asthma top dx [D-35], cardiac exclusion [D-36] verifiable in transcript. Hoarseness/phlegm accurate but minor. 'Knowledge graph relationship' fully hallucinated, not in transcript. 'Asthma exacerbation' close to 'asthma reoccurring' [D-35] but interpretive.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures answer around symptoms, history, clinical features, and doctor's linking (asthma elevation, cardiac rule-out), matching question. Minor off-topic 'knowledge graph' tangent."
