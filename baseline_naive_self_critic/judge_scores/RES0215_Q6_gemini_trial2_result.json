    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the doctor's plan is 'not included' in the text. This is a significant factual error because the plan is explicitly stated in [D-58] (physical exam, consulting a physician, and discussing next steps). It also fails to list several environmental factors mentioned in the transcript (smoking, pets, fireplaces, air filters).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the doctor's stated plan. Regarding environmental factors, it identifies only two (housing type and flooring) while missing four others mentioned in the Gold Answer (smoking, pets, fireplaces, and air filters). It includes 'colder weather,' which is an environmental factor but not specific to the 'home' as requested.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer claims the information is missing when it is clearly present in the source transcript, which constitutes a 'hallucination of absence.' The environmental factors it did list are accurately pulled from the text.",
