  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually inconsistent with both the Source Transcript and the Gold Answer. It incorrectly states that only patient turns are provided and that no doctor turns (D-X) are available, and that the transcript ends at [P-27]. In reality, the transcript includes many doctor turns (e.g., [D-1] onward) and explicitly contains the end-of-visit plan/summary in [D-47] and [D-48]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies the doctor’s end summary and plan (review story with supervising doctors, no constitutional symptoms, cough duration/worsening, green sputum, no blood). The Generated Answer therefore fails to provide the correct plan/assessment/next-step guidance and is based on a false premise about missing data.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points all missed: (1) end-of-visit plan to review the story with the doctors/supervisor [D-47]; (2) summary assessment: chronic cough ~3 months, worse last 3 days, nocturnal awakening, green sputum, no blood [D-47]; (3) stated absence of constitutional symptoms [D-47]; (4) next steps guided by supervising physician’s assessment after reviewing history, with no specific tests/treatments ordered. The Generated Answer provides none of these and instead claims the information is unavailable.",
    "faithfulness": "Multiple ungrounded/incorrect claims relative to the transcript: it asserts the transcript contains exclusively patient turns and ends at [P-27], which is false. It also asserts the doctor’s plan/assessment cannot be extracted due to missing doctor dialogue; however, [D-47] and [D-48] explicitly contain the plan and summary. Although it lists some patient-reported symptoms, the central claims about missing doctor content are hallucinated and contradict the provided transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at the asked elements (plan, assessment, guidance for next steps), but it does not actually answer them and instead asserts (incorrectly) that the information is unavailable. It remains on-topic but fails to deliver the requested content."
