  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states the 40-year smoking history [P-35] directly provides context for mild COPD [P-27]; Generated correctly identifies the smoking-COPD link and COPD management [P-28], relevance to SOB and COVID [D-43], but has minor errors like citing [P-34] for 40 years (actual [P-35]) and introducing unmentioned 'knowledge graph' links; core facts align with minor discrepancies.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: smoking 40 yrs [P-35]/quit [P-34], COPD [P-27]/LABA [P-28], direct smoking-COPD context, new/worsening/constant SOB unlike past [P-8-11], compromised lungs, chest X-ray [D-43], COVID symptoms [D-43], COPD+COVID eval need, lives alone/retired/limited outings [P-12,33,39]. Generated covers smoking-COPD, LABA, COPD relevance to SOB/COVID/chest X-ray (~60-70%), misses SOB details (new/unlike past), social context.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verifies smoking 40 yrs [P-35], quit [P-34], COPD [P-27], LABA [P-28], SOB new/worsening [P-8-11], COVID suspicion/chest X-ray [D-43]; Generated hallucinates entire 'knowledge graph' with specific RISK_FACTOR/EXACERBATES links not in transcript, wrong citation [P-34] for 40 years; multiple unverifiable claims.",
    "relevance": "Generated directly addresses smoking-to-COPD relation and COPD as risk for SOB/suspected COVID presentation with structured sections, no off-topic content."
