  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the sequence of symptoms (stuffy nose first, then runny nose) and the duration (one week). However, it incorrectly concludes that the symptoms were 'intermittent' based solely on the patient's first statement [P-1]. It fails to acknowledge the patient's later clarification in [P-8] that the symptoms had been 'pretty constant' when asked directly by the doctor. This leads to a factually incomplete representation of the patient's status compared to the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses two key points found in the Gold Answer: 1) The clarification in [P-8] that symptoms were constant despite the earlier 'on and off' comment, and 2) the mention of over-the-counter decongestants in [P-10] and their role in the symptom shift. It covers the basic chronology and the first symptom correctly.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is grounded in the transcript and uses correct citations for the parts it includes. However, by omitting [P-8], it presents a conclusion about the frequency of symptoms that is contradicted by later evidence in the text.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant, focusing strictly on the chronological progression and nature of the nasal symptoms as requested in the prompt."
