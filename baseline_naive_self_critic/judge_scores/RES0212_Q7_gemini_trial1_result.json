  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors. It states the cough duration is 'maybe for like a month' [P-19], ignoring the patient's explicit statement that she has had the cough for 'three months' [P-2, P-13]. Furthermore, it claims there is no information regarding fevers, whereas the patient explicitly reports feeling 'hot at night in the past couple days' [P-4]. It also fails to provide the 'three days ago' timing for the greenish sputum.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key chronological markers requested in the prompt: the 3-month initial onset, the specific 3-day mark for the onset of productive sputum, and the timeline for subjective fevers. It essentially misses the entire 'acute-on-chronic' progression described in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer displays poor faithfulness to the source transcript. It hallucinates that 'The transcript does not report the patient having a fever,' which is a direct contradiction of P-4. It also selectively uses a single quote about a one-month duration [P-19] while ignoring the primary onset statement of three months [P-2, P-13].",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant in structure, as it attempts to address each specific point requested by the prompt (onset, sleep, sputum, fevers). However, the information provided within those relevant sections is largely incorrect."
