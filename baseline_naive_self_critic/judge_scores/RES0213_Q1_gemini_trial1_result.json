  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the quality ('sharp', 'strong'), the trigger ('deep breath'), and the duration ('20 minutes'). However, it contains a significant factual error regarding the situations of occurrence: it claims the pain only occurs during anxiety attacks, whereas the transcript and Gold Answer specify it occurs while walking to school or studying alone. The transcript (P-20) discusses heart fluttering in relation to anxiety, not the primary chest pain described in P-3 and P-4.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it does not mention that the symptoms have lasted for a week and a half, it fails to describe the 'uncomfortable' or 'odd' quality initially mentioned, and it completely misses the specific situations in which the pain resolves (talking to others, hands-on tasks).",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that chest pain occurs 'only during episodes of anxiety attacks' is a misinterpretation of the transcript. In P-20, the patient is responding to a question about heart fluttering (palpitations), not the chest pain. The patient explicitly states in P-4 and P-9 that the chest pain occurs while walking to school and studying.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and follows the structure of the question, addressing quality, duration, and situations, although the content within the situational section is factually flawed."
