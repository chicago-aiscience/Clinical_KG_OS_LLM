    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all stated facts from the Gold Answer without any errors or contradictions. It correctly details the cough starting as a dry cough on Wednesday evening [P-1], worsening slightly on Thursday [P-1], further on Friday [P-1], fever emerging on Friday over 100°F [P-1], decreased appetite and possible loss of taste on Friday [P-17]. No factual inaccuracies.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: Wednesday evening cough onset after seeming fine [P-1]; Thursday cough worse and tired [P-1]; Friday cough worsening, fever first time (over 100) [P-1]; decreased appetite/breakfast disinterest/possible taste loss [P-15,P-17]. Missed: explicit first-time fever emphasis with temp details [P-2], significant fatigue specifically on Friday [P-25], mild runny nose [P-16], mother's summary of progression [P-12], three-day correction [P-4]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript: cough progression and tiredness from [P-1]; fever from [P-1]; appetite/taste from [P-17]. Citations accurate, no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring day-by-day evolution (Wed-Thu-Fri), cough onset/severity changes, fever emergence on Friday, and new symptoms like fatigue (Thu) and decreased appetite (Fri). No off-topic content."
