  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core symptoms: persistent dry cough (now), early productive mucus, sore throat, runny nose as resolved flu-like symptoms, and chest soreness/pain with excessive coughing. All facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript without contradictions or errors; minor phrasing like 'chest pain (or soreness)' matches transcript ('hurts a little bit'/'sore') and Gold's distinction of no independent pain.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold covered: persistent cough 2 weeks, dry now since ~day 5, resolved sore throat (2-3 days), runny nose (couple days), productive mucus (4-5 days), flu symptoms resolved early except cough, chest soreness with coughing. Missed: specific cough frequency (3-4x/hour), no triggers, stable intensity/frequency, pertinent negatives (no SOB, fever, N/V, abd pain), precise mucus description ('whitish clear'), exact timelines emphasized. Covers ~70% of detailed points.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations (e.g., [P-2],[P-5] for cough/dry; [P-14] for flu-like; [P-15],[P-16] for chest; [P-6] implied for mucus timeline). No hallucinations or unverifiable details; 'knowledge graph' mention is extraneous but not hallucinatory as no claims rely on it.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response around current vs. resolved symptoms as per question, using bullet points for clarity; no off-topic content, directly addresses specific symptoms reported during the two-week illness."
