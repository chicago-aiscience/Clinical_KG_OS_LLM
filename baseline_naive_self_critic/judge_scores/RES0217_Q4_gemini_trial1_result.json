{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is mostly accurate but contains a minor error in attribution. It links the patient's denial of fever/systemic illness to their comment about cholesterol medication ([P-14]), whereas the patient provided a direct 'No' to fever and illness earlier in the transcript ([P-8]). The core facts regarding the absence of the bullseye rash and joint pain are correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several key points included in the Gold Answer. Specifically, it fails to mention that the doctor screened for and the patient denied headaches ([D-19, P-19]). It also omits the assessment for other bites on the patient's body or family members ([P-9]) and the doctor's plan to consult with a supervising physician ([D-13, D-22]).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally faithful to the transcript, though the connection made between the cholesterol medication and the lack of systemic illness ([P-14]) is a slight misinterpretation of the context of that specific dialogue exchange.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question (clinical features and diagnostic tests) without including off-topic information."
