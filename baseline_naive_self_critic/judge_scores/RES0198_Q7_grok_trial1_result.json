  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states symptoms began one week prior with stuffy nose first [P-3], shifting to mostly runny [P-3], influenced by decongestants [P-10], initially 'on and off' [P-1] but clarified as 'pretty constant' [P-8] overall. Generated Answer correctly identifies one-week onset, stuffy first then to runny [P-3], but inaccurately states both symptoms began together (minor discrepancy) and claims intermittent based solely on [P-1], contradicting Gold's emphasis on constant [P-8]; misses decongestants. Significant contradictions on symptom pattern and omissions lead to score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1-week onset [P-1,P-2]; stuffy first [P-3]; shift to runny [P-3]; decongestant influence [P-10]; initial on/off [P-1] but constant [P-8]; continuous overall, no improvement [P-1]. Generated covers onset, stuffy first, shift to runny (~50%); misses decongestants, constant clarification, no improvement, nuanced pattern assessment. Covers 50-79% of key points, score 3.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer (onset [P-1], stuffy first to runny [P-3], on/off [P-1]) are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations; no hallucinated facts or unverifiable details, fully grounded, score 5.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured chronologically with sections on onset, progression, and summary bullets directly addressing which symptom first, predominant change, and frequency; no off-topic content, perfectly focused on question, score 5."
