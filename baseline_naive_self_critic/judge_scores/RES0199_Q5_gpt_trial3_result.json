  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect compared with the Gold Answer and the transcript. The doctor *did* systematically explore exposure sources: living situation (apartment in the city, lives alone) [P-45]; home/environmental triggers (old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets) [D-46]/[P-46]; sick contacts [D-47]/[P-47]; workplace and workplace illness (works at a car dealership [P-48]; asked if anyone at work was sick [D-50]/[P-50]); and travel history [D-49]/[P-49]. The Generated Answer incorrectly states none of these were referenced. It also incorrectly reports “loss of taste” whereas the patient reported decreased smell [P-24].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include essentially all key exposure-source questions and answers that the Gold Answer lists (living situation, environmental factors, sick contacts, workplace details and workplace illness, travel). It also omits the substance-use screening noted in the Gold Answer. Overall, it covers <20% of required key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Several assertions are not faithful to the transcript: it claims there was no exploration of travel/work/sick contacts despite explicit questions and answers ([D-47]–[D-50], [P-47]–[P-50]). It also states loss of taste rather than loss of smell. While it cites contact tracing correctly as mentioned in [D-52], the central claims conflict with the transcript, indicating poor grounding.",
    "relevance": "The response is aimed at the question of whether exposure sources were explored, but it includes unnecessary discussion of symptom assessment/management and incorrectly denies exploration. Still, the content is mostly on-topic (exposure-history exploration), with minor tangents."
