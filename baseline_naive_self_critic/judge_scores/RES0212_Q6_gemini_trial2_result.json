  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is completely incorrect. It claims that the doctor's turns and the end of the transcript are missing, whereas the provided source transcript contains the full dialogue up to [P-48], including the doctor's summary assessment and plan in [D-47].",
    "completeness": "The generated answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It does not mention the plan to review the case with other doctors, the summary of symptoms, or the lack of constitutional symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer hallucinated that the transcript was truncated at [P-27] and that doctor turns were missing. All claims about the 'missing' information are contradicted by the source text provided in the prompt.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer does not address the question at all, instead providing a meta-commentary on the supposedly missing data which was actually present."
