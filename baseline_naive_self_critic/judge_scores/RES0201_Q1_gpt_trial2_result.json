  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures some true positives (sore throat x4 days with dysphagia; tiredness and muscle aches) and correctly notes no loss of smell. However, it has major factual errors versus the Gold Answer/transcript: it omits the patient’s key symptom of difficulty breathing (started yesterday, constant, worsening) and omits the reduced sense of taste (started ~2 days ago, constant). It also incorrectly states the patient did not explicitly deny cough, runny nose, headache, chest pain, or fever—these were explicitly denied in the transcript (P-15 to P-18 and P-23). It misclassifies “loss of smell” as a reported symptom rather than a denial.",
    "completeness": "Missed key reported symptoms: difficulty breathing (onset yesterday, constant, worsening) and reduced taste (onset ~2 days, constant). Missed/incorrectly handled key explicit denials: cough, runny nose, headaches, chest pain, and fever (and also chills/night sweats, which are part of the Gold Answer’s negatives though not listed in the question examples). Included sore throat, swallowing difficulty, fatigue, muscle aches, and denial of smell. Overall coverage is well below full and misses multiple central elements.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements directly conflict with the transcript, especially the claim that cough/runny nose/headache/chest pain/fever were not explicitly denied. The transcript contains explicit denials of each. While the answer provides some accurate citations, these contradictions indicate poor grounding/faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "The response stays on-topic (reported symptoms and explicit denials of commonly screened symptoms) and does not meaningfully drift into unrelated areas. However, it fails to correctly identify several of the explicitly denied screened symptoms, reducing its practical relevance to the question’s intent."
