  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient’s only asthma medication as a bronchodilator/rescue medication and correctly characterizes it as used for symptom relief (i.e., not a daily maintenance regimen). It also correctly identifies that the clinician asked about a daily “every day no matter what” controller/maintenance medication that the patient does not have.\n\nMinor issues: it states the bronchodilator is administered as an “inhaler” and cites [P-1] for that, but the transcript support for “puffer/inhaler” is actually [D-7/P-7], not [P-1]. Also, calling the missing controller specifically a “controller inhaler” is reasonable but not explicitly stated; the transcript only specifies a daily medication, not the device/formulation.",
    "completeness": "Key points from the Gold Answer covered:\n- Only medication is a bronchodilator/rescue medication.\n- It is used for acute relief rather than daily maintenance (implicitly as-needed).\n- The clinician asked about a daily controller/maintenance medication and the patient does not have one.\n\nKey points missed or less explicit:\n- Does not clearly state “as-needed” use tied directly to [D-4/P-4].\n- Does not include the explicit denial of any other medications ([D-6/P-6], [D-30/P-30]).\n- Does not quote/anchor the administration method to the specific “puffer” wording ([D-7/P-7]), though “inhaler” is essentially equivalent clinically.",
    "faithfulness": "Most content is supported by the transcript (bronchodilator use, increased use, triggers, lack of daily medication). However, there is a citation problem: the claim that it is administered as an inhaler is attributed to [P-1], which does not establish the delivery device; that detail is supported later by [D-7/P-7]. The statement that the doctor asked about a “controller inhaler” is slightly more specific than the transcript (which only indicates a daily medication), but remains plausible and consistent with context.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers all parts of the question (current medication, administration route/device, and the type of missing daily controller medication) without irrelevant tangents."
