  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer contains several significant factual errors. It identifies the initial onset as 'maybe for like a month' based on P-19, whereas the patient explicitly states in P-2 and P-13 that they have had the cough for 'three months' and first noticed it at a pole dancing class. Furthermore, the generated answer incorrectly claims there is no information regarding subjective fevers, whereas P-4 explicitly states the patient has been 'feeling like hot at night in the past couple days'.",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover several key points from the Gold Answer: 1) It misses the 3-month initial onset. 2) It misses the specific timing (3 days) for when the cough became productive/greenish. 3) It completely omits the subjective fevers, despite them being a specific requirement of the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is not faithful to the transcript. It misinterprets P-19 (the duration of sleep disruption) as the total duration of the cough. It also contains a negative hallucination by claiming the transcript does not report fevers, when P-4 provides this information directly.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant in structure, as it attempts to address each section requested by the prompt (Initial Onset, Sleep Disruption, Productivity, Fevers). However, the content within those sections is inaccurate."
