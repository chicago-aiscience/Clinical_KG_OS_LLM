  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors and misrepresentations. It incorrectly claims the patient states 'only if I... if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack that's felt like that before' in P-20 when discussing chest pain, but P-20 actually refers to heart fluttering/palpitations, not chest pain. It fabricates the existence of a 'knowledge graph' that is never mentioned in the source materials. The Gold Answer correctly states the father's heart attack was 'last year' and he was in his 'pretty young' 50s, while the Generated Answer only says 'last year' without the age context. The Generated Answer also incorrectly attributes quotes and creates connections not explicitly stated in the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers the three main factors (family history, smoking, psychosocial stressors) but misses several key details from the Gold Answer. It omits: (1) the father now sees 'a lot of heart doctors', (2) specific smoking timeline (began at 18, 10 cigarettes/day for two years, recently cut to 5), (3) Masters in social work with thesis deadline pressure, (4) living alone in London, (5) nervous about running lately, (6) pain occurs when alone/studying but not when preoccupied with others, (7) teenage anxiety attacks may be returning, (8) paternal grandfather's young death in accident. It covers approximately 50-60% of the key points.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains multiple hallucinations. Most significantly, it repeatedly references a 'knowledge graph' that does not exist in the source materials, using phrases like 'According to the knowledge graph' and 'The knowledge graph explicitly states.' It also misattributes the P-20 quote about anxiety attacks to chest pain when it actually refers to heart palpitations. The fabricated knowledge graph relationships (e.g., '[FAMILY_HISTORY] family history of heart attack --[CAUSES]--> [CONTEXT] stress') are completely invented and not grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by examining how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to the patient's heart disease concerns. It attempts to show interactions between these factors and provides transcript citations. However, the reliance on fabricated 'knowledge graph' content and the structured format detract from directly answering how these factors are illustrated in the consultation itself. The answer is mostly relevant but includes tangential invented framework content."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer addresses the question's three main factors but contains significant problems. It fabricates a 'knowledge graph' that doesn't exist in source materials and misattributes quotes (confusing heart palpitations with chest pain in P-20). While it identifies family history, smoking, and stress as contributors to the patient's concerns, it misses many specific details present in the Gold Answer, including the father's age context, specific smoking timeline, thesis deadline pressure, living alone, and the temporal pattern of symptoms. The answer covers roughly 50-60% of key points but the hallucinated content and factual errors significantly undermine its reliability."
