  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer identifies onset symptoms as shortness of breath (laborious), fatigue/rundown/tiredness/weakness, reduced appetite, and generalized body aches (unspecified onset but grouped there). Recently: subjective fever yesterday. Morning: loss of taste and diminished smell (new). Emerging: dry cough 'on its way', sore throat 'starting', mild headaches (similar to baseline). Generated matches core onset symptoms (SOB/laborious cited, fatigue/weakness/loss of appetite), recent fever and loss of taste, emerging cough/sore throat (though slightly conflates citations: dry throat from cough P8, attributes sore throat feel to cough). Minor discrepancies: omits body aches, smell loss, headaches; minor citation mixup on emerging symptoms but facts consistent overall.",
    "completeness": "Covers onset: SOB, fatigue/tired/rundown, weakness, appetite loss (4/5 key points, misses aches). Recent: fever, taste loss (2/2, but misses smell in morning phase). Emerging: cough and sore throat feel (2/3, misses headaches). Covers ~85% of Gold's key points with structure matching phases.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly from transcript with accurate citations (P1-P4, P8-P9). Descriptions like 'laborious' breathing, 'dry like on its way' verbatim/paraphrased accurately. No hallucinations; 'emerged overnight' for taste is plausible inference from 'this morning'. Fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structures response into three phases matching question's timeline (onset couple days, recent incl. fever yesterday/taste morning, emerging at consult). No off-topic content, directly reconstructs symptom timeline."
