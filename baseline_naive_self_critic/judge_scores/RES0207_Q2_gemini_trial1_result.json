  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies Keppra as the medication. The statement that the patient forgot is factually accurate based on the transcript, but it stops short of providing the actual context found later in the conversation.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the core of the second question. While it notes the patient forgot, it completely omits the 'specific circumstance' described in the Gold Answer and transcript (the daughter's birthday and the change in the family's dinner routine). It only captures about 40-50% of the relevant information provided in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The information provided is directly supported by the transcript, specifically referencing P-23 and P-9.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant but lacks the necessary detail to fully satisfy the prompt's request for the 'specific circumstance.' Saying someone 'forgot' describes the result, not the circumstance leading to it."
