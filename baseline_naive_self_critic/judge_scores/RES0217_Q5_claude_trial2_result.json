  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the tick attachment duration calculation based on Friday hiking and Saturday gardening, matching the Gold Answer's explanation. However, it incorrectly claims there is NO evidence of the doctor discussing the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, when the transcript clearly shows the doctor stating 'I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario' [D-13] and 'Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point' [D-13]. This is a significant factual error contradicting the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 50% of the required content. It adequately addresses the tick attachment duration component but completely fails to acknowledge the geographic risk justification using the Lyme disease distribution map, which is a core element of the question and Gold Answer. The answer misses the critical [D-13] segment where the doctor explicitly uses the map to justify treatment.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major faithfulness violation. It explicitly claims the transcript 'do not contain evidence of the doctor discussing an Ontario Lyme disease distribution map,' which directly contradicts the actual transcript content in [D-13]. This is a clear case of misrepresenting what is actually present in the source material. The portion about tick attachment duration is faithful to the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses one of the two main components of the question (tick attachment duration) but fails to properly address the second component (geographic map justification). The claim that the map discussion is absent is relevant to the question but factually incorrect, making the response only partially relevant overall."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer correctly explains the tick attachment duration calculation but contains a critical error by claiming the doctor did not discuss the Ontario Lyme disease distribution map, when [D-13] clearly shows this discussion occurred. This represents both a factual error and a faithfulness violation, resulting in incomplete coverage of the question's requirements."
