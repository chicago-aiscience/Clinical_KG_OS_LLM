  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated timeline matches the Gold Answer on all major factual points: cough began Wednesday evening/night and was described as dry; it persisted and worsened on Thursday with notable tiredness; by Friday the cough was worse and fever was first noted as >100°F. The decreased appetite/disinterest in breakfast and possible loss of taste are accurately attributed to Friday. No statements contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Covers most key elements: (1) cough first appearing Wednesday night, (2) day-by-day worsening of cough through Friday, (3) fever first appearing Friday with approximate magnitude, and (4) decreased appetite/possible loss of taste on Friday. Misses some Gold Answer details including the mild runny nose on Friday and the explicit clarification/correction that symptoms have been present ~3 days (not 5) and the mother’s stepwise summary statement [P-12]. Fatigue is mentioned for Thursday but not reiterated as a continuing/new systemic symptom on Friday as in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are directly supported by the transcript citations/wording (P-1, P-17). No clear hallucinations or unverifiable additions are present.",
    "relevance": "Directly answers the question with a day-by-day evolution focused on cough onset/progression and emergence of fever and other symptoms. No notable tangents."
