  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the main symptoms reported at presentation: wheeze, shortness of breath, and a slight cough (all in P-1), and it appropriately references difficulty taking deep breaths (P-2). However, it is inaccurate/incomplete regarding the *earliest* symptoms: when explicitly asked what she noticed first (D-2), the mother reported **both wheezing and difficulty taking in deep breaths** (P-2). The Generated Answer names only wheezing as the earliest symptom, which does not fully match the transcript/Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: wheeze, shortness of breath, slight cough; difficulty taking deep breaths is mentioned.\nKey Gold Answer points missed: that **difficulty taking deep breaths was also an earliest symptom** (not just wheeze); exertional dyspnea/“quite out of breath” with activity (P-3); “hard time catching her breath” during episodes and denial of cyanosis (P-32); non-productive nature of cough (P-31). Overall coverage is partial.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms and supporting quotes the Generated Answer cites are present in the transcript (P-1, P-2). It does not introduce clearly fabricated details. The main issue is omission (earliest symptoms) rather than hallucination.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the respiratory symptoms at presentation and which appeared earliest, with no meaningful off-topic content."
