    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all the key facts from the Gold Answer. It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the condition to rule out, the swab test, the 24-48 hour turnaround time, and another viral illness as the alternative diagnosis. All facts are consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major points from the Gold Answer regarding the primary condition, diagnostic test, turnaround time, and alternative diagnosis.
