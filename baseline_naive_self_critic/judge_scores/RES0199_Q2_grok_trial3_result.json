  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately identifies Tylenol for headache relief with correct citation [P-3], matching Gold. Doctor's recommendations for hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, and Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches/pains are factual and consistent with Gold and [D-52]. Minor discrepancies: omits patient's self-hydration [P-30], COVID test, and isolation [D-52]; does not specify acetaminophen; but core facts are correct without contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers: Tylenol for headache; doctor's supportive measures (hydration, nutritious food, sleep); medications (Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Missed from Gold: patient's self-hydration effort [P-30]; no prescription meds; COVID swab and 14-day isolation [D-52]. Covers ~85% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims (Tylenol for headache [P-3], doctor's recs [D-52]) verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. Minor unverifiable: references non-existent 'knowledge graph provided' and specific graph relationship, which is not in source transcript (slight hallucination but does not alter facts).",
    "relevance": "Directly and comprehensively addresses the question on patient's home medication/symptom and doctor's recommended medications/supportive measures; structured response with no off-topic content."
