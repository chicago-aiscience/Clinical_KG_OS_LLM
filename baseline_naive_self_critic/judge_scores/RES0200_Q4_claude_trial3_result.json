  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19/Covid as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the specific diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All three core facts align perfectly with the Gold Answer and are accurately cited from [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key points requested in the question: (1) alternative diagnosis to exclude, (2) specific diagnostic test ordered, and (3) expected turnaround time. However, the Gold Answer provides additional context about which symptoms overlapped (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) and notes the doctor's exact phrasing about symptom overlap. The Generated Answer is more concise but captures all essential information requested.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The doctor explicitly states 'because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid we'll also do a covid swab' and 'you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours.' All citations are accurate and no hallucinations are present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question without any irrelevant information. It stays perfectly focused on the alternative diagnosis, the diagnostic test, and the turnaround time."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly accurate and faithful to the source transcript, correctly identifying COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All information is properly cited from [D-52]. The answer is slightly less complete than the Gold Answer as it omits contextual details about which specific symptoms overlapped, but it fully addresses all three components of the question as asked. The response is concise, relevant, and contains no errors or hallucinations."
