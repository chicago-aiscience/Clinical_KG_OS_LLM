  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the core respiratory symptoms from the transcript: increased cough, increased green/yellow sputum, small amount of blood with hard coughing, and worsened shortness of breath (all consistent with [P-1]). It also correctly identifies sinus pressure ([P-12]) and correctly states that cough was most bothersome ([P-12]).\nMinor inaccuracy: it states the patient “reported having a fever last night,” whereas the transcript is more tentative (“may have had a fever… felt really hot” and had no thermometer) ([P-9–P-11]).",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: increased cough, increased green/yellow sputum, hemoptysis, worsened dyspnea, possible fever/feeling hot, sinus pressure, and “cough most bothersome.”\nKey Gold Answer elements missed: reduced exercise tolerance/functional decline with walking dog/around the block becoming harder ([P-4]); mild headache ([P-14]). It also omits the Gold Answer’s pertinent negatives, though those are less central to the user’s question.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by cited transcript lines. The only notable faithfulness issue is slight over-certainty about fever (presented as definite rather than possible), but it remains grounded in the patient reporting feeling hot and suspecting fever ([P-9–P-11]). No clear hallucinated symptoms are added.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked items: respiratory and systemic symptoms during the 3-day worsening and the most bothersome symptom. No major tangents."
