  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies the loss of taste as a 'complete loss' based only on the patient's initial statement [P-1], whereas the transcript later clarifies [P-4] that it is a partial loss (the patient can still taste very salty foods). It correctly identifies the loss of smell as partial and the cough as mild and dry.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include the specific details requested by the prompt regarding what the patient could and could not still perceive (e.g., being able to smell really bad things, being able to taste salty foods, and being unable to taste bananas). It also omits the duration (two days) and details about the cough being non-productive/consistent.",
    "faithfulness": "The claims are grounded in the transcript (specifically P-1), but the answer ignores subsequent clarifying information in P-4. While not a hallucination, it is a failure to synthesize the full dialogue context.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses the basic symptoms but fails to follow the specific instruction to 'Include any details the patient provided about what they could and could not still perceive.' This makes it only partially relevant to the full scope of the question."
