  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually accurate and fully consistent with both the Gold Answer and the source transcript. All key facts are correctly stated: COVID-19 swab ordered with 24-48 hour results, 14-day isolation, public health contact tracing if positive, and all supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol/NSAIDs for symptoms). The Generated Answer appropriately notes the management applies regardless of whether it's COVID or another viral illness.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all major components from the Gold Answer: diagnostic test (COVID swab), isolation duration (14 days), contact tracing conditions (if positive), alternative diagnosis consideration (other viral illness), and comprehensive supportive care recommendations (hydration, nutrition, sleep, antipyretics, NSAIDs). However, it omits the specific detail that results would be available 'in about 24 to 48 hours' and the explicit statement that 'no prescription medications were ordered beyond the supportive measures.' These are minor omissions that don't significantly impact completeness.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is well-grounded in the transcript, with all claims directly verifiable in [D-52]. The answer appropriately cites the source and even references the Knowledge Graph to support certain claims. No hallucinated content is present. The addition of Knowledge Graph references actually demonstrates extra verification rather than fabrication. All statements can be traced back to the doctor's management plan statement in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly focused and directly addresses all aspects of the question: diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, and supportive care recommendations. The structure mirrors the question's components perfectly with clear bullet points. The mention of the Knowledge Graph, while adding context, is relevant supporting information rather than tangential content. No off-topic information is included."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer provides an excellent, comprehensive response that accurately captures the doctor's complete management plan. It correctly identifies all key components: COVID-19 swab testing, 14-day isolation, conditional contact tracing, and all supportive care measures. The answer is factually accurate, well-grounded in the transcript with appropriate citations, and highly relevant to the question. Minor deductions in completeness are due to omitting the specific '24-48 hour' timeframe for results and the explicit statement about no prescription medications, though these are relatively minor details that don't significantly impact the overall quality of the response."
