  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Gold Answer identifies wheezing and difficulty taking deep breaths as the earliest symptoms per P-2, which directly responds to D-2's question about what was noticed first four to five days ago. The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies only 'wheezy' as the earliest symptom, relying on P-1's phrasing, omitting the second symptom from P-2. Other symptoms (wheezy, shortness of breath, slight cough, difficulty taking deep breaths) align well with Gold's presentation symptoms from P-1 and P-2. Additional Gold details like non-productive cough (P-31), out of breath with activity (P-3), hard time catching breath without cyanosis (P-32) are not contradicted but not fully matched in emphasis. Some factual errors on earliest symptoms.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: presentation symptoms (wheezy 4-5 days, short of breath, slight cough now [P-1]); out of breath with activity [P-3]; hard time catching breath, no cyanosis [P-32]; earliest wheezing + difficulty deep breaths [P-2]; cough recent/non-productive [P-1/P-31]; looks fine [P-9]. Generated covers wheezy, shortness of breath, cough (recent), difficulty deep breaths (~4/7 main points), but misses out of breath/activity, hard time/no cyanosis, non-productive, looks fine, and fully misses second earliest symptom. Covers ~50-79% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All Generated claims (symptoms from P-1/P-2, wheezy earliest with cough later from P-1 phrasing) are directly verifiable in transcript with accurate citations. No fabricated details; interpretation of P-1 for onset timing is plausible and grounded, even if P-2 provides more precise response to 'first' question.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured to directly list specific respiratory symptoms at presentation and explicitly identify the earliest one, with evidence citations, containing no off-topic content and perfectly mirroring the question's two-part structure."
