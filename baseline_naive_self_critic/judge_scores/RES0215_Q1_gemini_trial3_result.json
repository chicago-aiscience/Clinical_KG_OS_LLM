  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the three main symptoms mentioned in P-1 and the additional symptom mentioned in P-2. It accurately identifies wheezing as a starting symptom.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer is nearly complete but misses one detail found in the Gold Answer. Specifically, when asked what was noticed 'first', the mother listed both 'wheezy' and 'difficulty taking in deep breaths' [P-2]; the generated answer only names 'wheezy' for the 'earliest' category. It also omits secondary details included in the Gold Answer such as the cough being non-productive and the lack of cyanosis.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the source transcript, providing accurate citations (e.g., [P-1], [P-2]) for the symptoms mentioned.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the user's question without any off-topic information."
