  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 (Covid) as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the diagnostic test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. All core facts align with the Gold Answer and the transcript at [D-52].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three key components requested in the question: (1) alternative diagnosis to exclude, (2) specific diagnostic test ordered, and (3) expected turnaround time. However, it lacks the additional context provided in the Gold Answer about which specific symptoms overlapped (worsening cough, shortness of breath, chills) and the broader clinical picture. This contextual information, while valuable, was not explicitly requested in the question.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript at [D-52]. The citations are accurate and appropriate. No hallucinated information is present. The answer is fully grounded in the source material.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses all three parts of the question without any irrelevant content. It stays focused on the specific information requested: alternative diagnosis, diagnostic test, and turnaround time."

It correctly identifies COVID-19 as the alternative diagnosis, the COVID swab as the test, and 24-48 hours as the turnaround time. While it lacks some contextual details about symptom overlap provided in the Gold Answer, this information was not explicitly requested in the question. The answer is concise, well-grounded, and highly relevant."
