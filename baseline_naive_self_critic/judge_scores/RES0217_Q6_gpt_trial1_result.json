  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately lists the planned physical exam, tick identification via lab, and blood work/serology, and correctly states prophylactic antibiotics due to likely prolonged attachment (72+ hours). It does not introduce major contradictions. Minor inaccuracy/speculation: it characterizes the physician to be consulted as “likely a colleague or specialist” and says the purpose is to “review the results,” whereas the transcript only states they will “go talk to the doctor” and that a physician will also look at the patient—no specialist or explicit “review results” is stated.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements covered: quick physical exam; tick sent to local lab for species ID; blood work for Lyme titres/serology; prophylactic antibiotics; plan to talk to/consult supervising physician; preventive garden advice (ticks in long grass/edge of woods-fields, waving motion, consider insecticide). Missed/under-emphasized: the plan to treat also considered geographic risk (Strathroy being a concerning point) as part of the rationale for antibiotics; and the explicit notion that the physician would also examine the patient (it’s implied but not clearly stated as in Gold).",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are directly supported by cited transcript lines. Minor unverifiable embellishments include “knowledge graph provided,” “likely a colleague or specialist,” and “to review the results.” Otherwise, diagnostic/treatment/prevention content is grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the requested clinical plan elements (tests, treatment, consultation, and preventive advice) without significant tangents."

  "summary": "The generated answer is largely accurate and well-focused, capturing most components of the end-of-visit plan, but it omits the geographic-risk rationale for antibiotics and includes minor speculative phrasing about the physician consultation."
