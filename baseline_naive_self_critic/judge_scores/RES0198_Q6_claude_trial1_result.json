  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer aligns very well with the Gold Answer on all factual points. Both identify the same diagnosis (viral infection/common cold), the same supportive care recommendations (hydration and Tylenol Cold), the same diagnostic test (COVID swab with 48-hour results), and the same public health guidance (isolation until results, then further instructions from public health). The Generated Answer adds minor contextual details (like 'ruled out COVID-19') that are implicit in the Gold Answer but not contradictory.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) stated diagnosis as viral infection/common cold, (2) supportive care recommendations of hydration and OTC medications (Tylenol Cold), (3) the diagnostic COVID swab test ordered for today with 48-hour turnaround, and (4) public health guidance including isolation and awaiting further instructions. The Generated Answer also captures the expectation about symptom duration ('few weeks') mentioned in the Gold Answer, though perhaps less explicitly. All major elements are present.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript, specifically in [D-39]. The diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test, and public health guidance are all accurately quoted or paraphrased from the doctor's statement. Citations to [D-39] are appropriate and accurate. No hallucinated content is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the question by systematically covering the complete management plan as requested: diagnosis, supportive care recommendations, diagnostic test ordered, and public health guidance. The answer is well-organized with clear sections matching the question's structure. No irrelevant content is included."
