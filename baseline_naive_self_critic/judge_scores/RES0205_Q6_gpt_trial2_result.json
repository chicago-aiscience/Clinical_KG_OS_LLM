  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects the doctor’s stated plan at the end of the visit: (1) listen to heart and lungs and do a quick physical exam, and (2) then speak with the doctor they’re working with, review what was discussed, and return to the patient to discuss next steps. These elements are consistent with [D-37] and do not contradict the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "It captures the core plan and process described in [D-37] (auscultation + quick exam; consult supervising doctor; review discussion; return to discuss next steps). However, compared with the Gold Answer, it omits: (a) that this approach was also foreshadowed at the start of the encounter [D-1], (b) that the patient explicitly agreed to the plan [P-37], and (c) the explicit note that no diagnosis/medication was provided at this stage. These are supporting details in the Gold Answer rather than the core end-of-consult plan, but they are still missing relative to Gold.",
    "faithfulness": "The statements are well-grounded in the transcript and appropriately referenced to [D-37]. A minor imprecision is implying the colleague alone would review everything, whereas the transcript suggests the speaker will go over it with the supervising doctor (a joint review). This does not substantially change the meaning.",
    "relevance": "The answer is tightly focused on the question: it reports the specified physical exam components and the described process for determining next steps, with no meaningful irrelevant content."
