  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea as GI symptoms and dry cough as respiratory, matching the transcript and Gold Answer basics [P-1, P-12]. However, it incorrectly classifies headache as a respiratory symptom, despite it being neurological; wrongly states diarrhea frequency and vomiting episodes are unspecified (contradicting P-28 'five or six times a day' and P-32 'vomited two times'); claims no numerical headache severity (contradicting P-8 '7'); misses timelines, qualities (e.g., liquid stools, food contents vomit), and negatives. Significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold Answer warrant a score of 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points include: cough (dry, 4 days start, stable, no sputum/blood, resp negatives); diarrhea (2 days, liquid, 5-6x/day, no blood); vomiting (yesterday, 2 episodes, food contents, no blood), nausea; headache (4 days, persistent, bilateral forehead/top, 7/10, no radiation/stiffness); plus loss of smell/fatigue. Generated covers basic symptoms (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, dry cough, headache) but misses all specifics like timelines, frequencies (diarrhea 5-6x/day missed), vomiting count (2 missed), headache severity (7/10 missed), qualities, negatives. Covers ~20-30% of key points, score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims like dry cough [P-12] and basic symptoms [P-1] are verifiable. However, 'diarrhea frequency not specified' ignores P-28 ('five or six times a day'); 'vomiting episodes not specified' ignores P-32 ('two times'); 'no numerical severity' ignores P-8 ('7'); headache as respiratory is not grounded (hallucinated category, headache discussed separately D-3 to D-10). Multiple unverifiable/incorrect claims about absences indicate hallucination/misreading, score 2.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly structures response around GI/respiratory symptoms and the specified characteristics (cough nature, diarrhea freq, vomiting #, headache severity), with no major off-topic content, though answers are incomplete/incorrect. Minor misclassification but focused on question, score 4."
