  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core triad of symptoms (dry cough worsening, fever >100°F, possible loss of taste) matching the Gold Answer and transcript citations. It correctly notes the doctor's alignment with COVID-19 symptoms [D-44] (minor wording difference: 'compatible' vs. transcript's 'allowed'/Gold's 'aligned') and use of fever to differentiate from asthma toward infection [D-45]. However, it introduces a minor discrepancy with 'knowledge graph logic' not present in Gold or transcript, though core facts remain consistent.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key Gold points: triad symptoms with accurate descriptions and most cites (dry cough worsening [P-1,P-5,P-12 implied], fever details [P-1,P-2], taste change [P-17]); COVID alignment [D-44]; fever's role in concluding infection over asthma [D-45]; collective use for viral prioritization. Minor miss: explicit 'acute onset/systemic involvement (fatigue, appetite)' phrasing, but implied via symptoms; covers ~90%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: symptom details and quotes/cites match transcript (e.g., dry cough [P-1,P-5], fever [P-1,P-2], taste [P-17], COVID [D-44 slight paraphrase], infection vs. asthma [D-45]). Hallucination: 'knowledge graph logic' and explicit 'fever and loss of taste are indicators of COVID-19' not in transcript (doctor doesn't state this reasoning). Plausible medically but adds unverifiable interpretation.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by specifying the exact symptom combination (respiratory complaint, temperature, taste change) and explaining collective use (fever differentiates to infection, aligns with COVID), with no off-topic content."
