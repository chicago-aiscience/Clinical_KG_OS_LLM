    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Reactine and over-the-counter medications for seasonal allergies, and accurately notes no prescribed medications, aligning with Gold Answer's key facts from [P-36], [P-46], [P-47]. However, it inaccurately attributes statements to 'the patient' (the 8-year-old child who does not speak) instead of the parent (P), and fails to explicitly state that no medications were given for the current respiratory episodes (resolving on their own per [P-33, P-34]). It also omits past viral infections requiring no antibiotics [P-16]. Minor discrepancies but core facts correct.",
    "completeness": "Gold Answer key points: (1) no meds/treatments for current wheezing/SOB (resolves with rest [P-33, P-34]); (2) occasional OTC Reactine for seasonal allergies [P-35, P-36]; (3) no prescribed medications [P-36, P-46, P-47]; (4) past viral infections no antibiotics [D-16, P-16]. Generated covers (2) and (3) (~50%), misses (1) and (4).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims about Reactine and OTC from [P-36] verifiable, no prescribed correct. However, hallucinates 'knowledge graph' [KG] and association not in transcript; misattributes quotes to 'the patient' instead of parent (P). Multiple unverifiable/misattributed details.",
    "relevance": "Directly lists medications (Reactine/OTC for allergies), confirms no prescribed meds, addressing the question on treatments for current/other conditions and prescribed management; minor lack of specificity on current episodes but mostly on-topic."
