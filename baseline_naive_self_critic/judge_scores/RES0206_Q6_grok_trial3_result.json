  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer includes physical exam (vitals incl. temp tie-in, chest auscultation), COVID swab, labs, preliminary COPD exacerbation impression, disposition criteria (labs/vitals), attending consult, patient agreement. Generated covers physical exam/chest listen, vitals, COVID swab, labs, criteria (labs/vitals), consult, discussion return. Minor discrepancies: misses explicit temp reference/earlier tie-in, preliminary impression, patient agreement; core plan facts accurate.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points covered: physical exam/chest (yes), vitals/temp (vitals yes, temp tie-in no), COVID swab (yes), labs (yes), disposition criteria (yes), attending consult (yes). Missed: preliminary clinical impression, specific temp context from earlier dialogue, patient agreement. Covers ~85-90% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All Generated claims directly verifiable in [D-43]: physical exam/listen chest, vitals, COVID swab, labs/vitals for decision, attending consult, return to discuss. No hallucinations or unverifiable additions; vitals implicitly include temp mentioned earlier but not hallucinated.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question by structuring the doctor's end-of-consultation plan with examinations (physical/vitals/chest), tests (COVID swab/labs), consultations (attending), and criteria (labs/vitals for ER admit vs discharge), with no off-topic content."
