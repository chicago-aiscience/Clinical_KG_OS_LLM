  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer accurately identifies the exposure events and the calculation of the 72-hour duration. However, for the geographic risk assessment, it provides general information about tick habitats (long grass) rather than the specific assessment mentioned in the transcript (Strathroy and the Ontario Lyme distribution map). It also contains a citation error, attributing the 'safer than not' quote to [D-6] when it is actually in [D-18].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key details found in the Gold Answer: specifically the location 'Strathroy', the use of the Ontario Lyme distribution map, and the patient's explanation that all local ticks are now considered potential carriers (which explains why the visual appearance was disregarded).",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims are grounded in the transcript. However, the term 'known susceptibility' is a logical hallucination, as a prior tick bite does not medically imply susceptibility to future ones. The citation for the 'safer than not' quote is also incorrect.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant and structured exactly according to the categories requested in the prompt."
