  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states there is 'no clinical information' about a runny nose, when the transcript clearly shows the patient reported having a runny nose for 'the past couple of days' [D-11, P-11] with 'pretty clear' discharge [D-12, P-12]. It also fails to mention the cough remained stable ('stayed the same' [P-7]), mischaracterizes the cough as potentially 'worsened,' and omits crucial information about the patient never having a dry cough like this before and previous runny noses not lasting this long [P-24].",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 50% of key points. It correctly identifies the 4-5 day onset of cough and mentions the cough not improving, but completely misses: (1) the runny nose starting 2-3 days after the cough, (2) the sequential onset pattern, (3) the cough remaining stable in severity, (4) the dry/non-productive nature throughout, (5) comparison to prior episodes being novel ('never had a dry cough like this'), and (6) previous runny noses being shorter in duration.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination by claiming 'no clinical information' about runny nose exists when it's clearly documented in the transcript [D-11, P-11, D-12, P-12]. The reference to 'clinical knowledge graph' appears fabricated. However, some claims are verifiable (4-5 day onset, no improvement, fever history, asthma workup). The incorrect assertion about runny nose represents a serious factual fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the question's components but with significant gaps. It discusses cough onset and duration, attempts to compare symptoms (though incorrectly denying runny nose), and touches on comparison to prior experiences. However, by completely missing the runny nose information and failing to address the sequential timing relationship between symptoms, it only partially addresses the core question about symptom development over time."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. Most critically, it contains a major factual error by claiming no information exists about the runny nose when the transcript clearly documents it [D-11, P-11, D-12, P-12]. The response correctly identifies the 4-5 day cough onset but misses key details about symptom progression, severity stability, and the sequential relationship between cough and runny nose. It fails to capture the patient's statement that this dry cough is unprecedented and previous runny noses were shorter in duration [P-24]. The reference to a 'clinical knowledge graph' appears fabricated. While the answer attempts to address the question's components, the combination of factual errors, incomplete coverage, and hallucinated content significantly undermines its clinical utility."
