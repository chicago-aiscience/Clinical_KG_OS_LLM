  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the cough onset as 4-5 days prior [P-2], notes it is not improving [P-2], and partially addresses its dry nature, aligning with Gold. However, it inaccurately implies worsening ('persisted or worsened') when Gold and transcript state it 'stayed the same' [P-7]. Critically, it falsely claims no information on runny nose despite clear transcript evidence [P-11, P-12] and Gold summary, contradicting the sequential timing (runny nose 2-3 days later). Prior experiences partially covered via asthma [P-28] but misses key Gold points like novel dry cough and longer duration of runny nose [P-24]. Significant contradictions on core symptoms warrant score 2.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) cough 4-5 days first symptom (covered); (2) dry/non-productive (partial); (3) severity unchanged (missed, implied worsening); (4) runny nose couple days later/clear (completely missed); (5) sequential progression (missed); (6) prior: no prior dry cough like this, shorter past runny noses, healthy (missed, partial asthma). Covers ~20-30% (mainly cough onset/persistence), misses runny nose timing/relation and most prior comparison. Score 2.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: cough timing [P-2], persistence [P-2], asthma workup [P-28]. Hallucinations: 'clinical knowledge graph' (not in transcript); denies runny nose existence despite [P-11: 'past couple of days'], [P-12: 'pretty clear'] – direct fabrication/oversight. Adds ungrounded COVID/chest x-ray as 'confirming dry cough subtype.' Multiple unverifiable/erroneous claims. Score 2.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around onset, cough vs runny nose timing, prior experiences, matching question. However, wrongly dismisses runny nose, adds off-topic fever/chills [P-13] and asthma details not central to symptom progression/timing. Partially relevant with some off-topic. Score 3."
