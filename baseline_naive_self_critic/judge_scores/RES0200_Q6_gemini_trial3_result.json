  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the medical details provided in the transcript and gold answer. It correctly identifies the lab tests, imaging, and medications. One minor structural point: it categorizes the COVID swab as a therapeutic intervention rather than a diagnostic test, but the fact of the order is correct.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer captures almost all key points from the gold answer. It misses the specific mention of blood pressure monitoring (from D-37) and the 24-48 hour timeline for COVID swab results, both of which were included in the gold answer as part of the comprehensive plan.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided is directly supported by the transcript [D-52], [D-37], and [P-11]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the multi-part question by categorizing the responses into laboratory tests, imaging, monitoring, and therapeutics."
