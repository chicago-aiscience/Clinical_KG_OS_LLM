  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures core facts like productive cough with yellow sputum and red spots (citing P-4, P-6), chills (P-9), exertional dyspnea (P-10), and right-sided pleuritic chest pain worsening with deep breathing/coughing (P-17, P-18, P-19), aligning with Gold's emphasis on these for pneumonia; minor discrepancies include inferring fever primarily from chills via a non-transcript 'knowledge graph' instead of direct citation (P-8), omitting smoking history as a risk factor, and less detail on pain being constant/dull/at rest (P-20, P-21), but no major contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers key Gold points: productive cough/yellow sputum/red spots (100%), systemic signs (chills fully, fever partially), exertional dyspnea (fully), pleuritic chest pain details (worsens with breathing/coughing fully, but misses constant/dull/at rest aspects); misses smoking history as predisposing factor; overall ~85% coverage.",
    "faithfulness": "Most claims verifiable: sputum/cough [P-4,P-6], chills [P-9], dyspnea [P-10], pain [P-17,P-18,P-19], sore throat post-cough [P-15]; however, introduces unverifiable 'knowledge graph' references twice (chills-fever link, exertion-pain link) not present in transcript, and describes pain as potentially 'sharp' while transcript specifies 'dull' [P-21]; some hallucinated elements but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses question by listing specific transcript findings (with citations) pointing to pneumonia and dedicating a section to how pleuritic pain (worsening with deep breathing/coughing) supports diagnosis via pleural inflammation; structured, focused, no off-topic content."
