  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error by stating that 'specific prescription medications for COPD are not explicitly named in the provided text.' In reality, transcript [P-28] explicitly mentions a 'long acting beta agonist.' The rest of the information regarding vitamins and self-treatment is correct.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses the primary prescription medication (long-acting beta agonist) and the patient's current status regarding alcohol, cannabis, and other drug use, which were included in the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the absence of information that is clearly present in the text (the COPD medication), which contradicts the 'grounded in transcript' requirement.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant to the question asked, focusing on medications and treatments, although it fails to find all the correct information within the source."
