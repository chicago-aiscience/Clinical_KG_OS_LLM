  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It explicitly states that there is 'no evidence' in the transcript that the doctor asked about weight loss, travel, sick contacts, or chemical exposure. However, these questions are clearly present in the transcript at [D-22], [D-23], [D-24], and [D-34]. The Gold Answer correctly identifies these segments and explains their clinical significance.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses 100% of the key points requested by the prompt. It does not address the differential diagnoses for weight loss (lung cancer/TB), travel (endemic infections), sick contacts (person-to-person spread), or chemical exposure (occupational lung disease). Instead, it provides a general analysis of other symptoms.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer fails significantly on faithfulness by claiming the requested information is absent from the source material when it is explicitly documented. This is a hallucination of omission.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is irrelevant to the specific prompt. While it attempts to analyze the case using other symptoms (cough, chest pain, smoking), it refuses to answer the actual question asked, based on the false premise that the data is missing."
