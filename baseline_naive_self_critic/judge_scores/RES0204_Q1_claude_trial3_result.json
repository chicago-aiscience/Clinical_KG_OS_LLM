  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not specify whether the cough is productive or non-productive, when the transcript explicitly establishes it as a dry (non-productive) cough in D-5, P-5, D-6, and P-6. It also incorrectly states that nasal discharge appearance is not reported, when the patient explicitly describes having a runny nose with 'pretty clear' discharge in P-11 and P-12. The answer misses the second major respiratory symptom entirely (runny nose).",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers less than 20% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It identifies the cough but fails to: (1) correctly characterize it as non-productive/dry, (2) mention that the patient denied producing sputum, (3) note the cough stayed the same, (4) report the runny nose as a second symptom, (5) describe the nasal discharge as clear, (6) note the timeline difference between symptoms, and (7) include relevant negative findings like no sore throat or chest pain.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer demonstrates poor faithfulness with multiple errors that contradict information clearly present in the transcript. The claims that the cough nature is unspecified and that nasal discharge is not reported are directly contradicted by explicit exchanges in the transcript (D-5/P-5, D-6/P-6 for cough; D-11/P-11, D-12/P-12 for nasal discharge). These are not minor omissions but active misrepresentations of documented information.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer partially addresses the question by identifying one respiratory symptom (cough) but fails to fully characterize it or identify the second symptom (runny nose). The question specifically asks about 'respiratory symptoms' (plural), nature of cough, and appearance of nasal discharge - all of which are addressed incompletely or incorrectly."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is largely inaccurate and incomplete. It incorrectly claims that critical information about the cough nature and nasal discharge is not provided in the transcript, when in fact both are explicitly documented. It misses the second respiratory symptom entirely (runny nose) and fails to capture the detailed characteristics that are clearly present in the transcript exchanges. The answer demonstrates poor faithfulness to the source material by misrepresenting what information is available."
