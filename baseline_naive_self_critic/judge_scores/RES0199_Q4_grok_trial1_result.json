  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer matches the Gold Answer on all core facts: condition to rule out is COVID-19 (minor quote variation 'as covid' in transcript/Generated vs 'is covid' in Gold, but intent identical); diagnostic test is a swab; turnaround time is 24-48 hours; alternative diagnosis if negative is another viral illness. No factual errors or contradictions. All consistent.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) rule out COVID-19; (2) swab test; (3) 24-48 hours TAT; (4) isolate 14 days (meantime); (5) public health tracing if positive; (6) alternative another viral illness if negative; (7) supportive management either way. Generated covers (1)-(3) and (6) fully (100% of question's direct asks), omits (4),(5),(7) which are contextual elaborations in Gold but not essential to the precise question elements. Covers core 100%, minor omissions of extras → 80-99%.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated are directly verifiable in transcript [D-52]: quotes for COVID rule-out, swab, 24-48 hours, and alternative viral illness are accurate to transcript wording (e.g., 'as covid', 'take a swab'). No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications. Citations precise.",
    "relevance": "Generated Answer is structured perfectly around the question's four components (condition, test, TAT, alternative if negative) with numbered responses and direct quotes. No tangents, irrelevant content, or extraneous information. Directly addresses the question."
