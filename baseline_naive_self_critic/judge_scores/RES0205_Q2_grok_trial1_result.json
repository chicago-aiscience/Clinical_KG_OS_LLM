  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately states that the patient is not taking anxiety medication, having stopped it 2-3 years ago [P-24], and manages acid reflux through dietary avoidance of acidic foods and chocolate, which has helped [P-25]. These facts match the Gold Answer and transcript exactly with no errors or contradictions. It does not introduce any incorrect information, even if incomplete.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer covered: anxiety no current meds, stopped 2-3 years ago; acid reflux managed by diet (avoid acidic foods/chocolate), helped quite a bit, no meds. Missed: overall statement of no prescribed medications [P-23]; hay fever no treatment described [P-27]; cough - patient requested meds but none prescribed yet [P-35, D-37]; summary of zero medications across all conditions (anxiety, reflux, hay fever, cough). Covers approximately 50-60% of key points (fully covers two main chronic conditions).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript: anxiety history [P-24], reflux management details [P-25]. Citations are accurate. No hallucinated facts or unverifiable details; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly addresses current medication/treatment status for anxiety and acid reflux (explicitly highlighted in question), structuring response clearly by condition. However, it omits status for other conditions (hay fever, cough) and overall no-prescription summary, making it mostly but not fully comprehensive for 'across all conditions'."
