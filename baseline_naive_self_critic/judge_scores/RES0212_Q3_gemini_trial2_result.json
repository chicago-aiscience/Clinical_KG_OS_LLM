  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the diagnosis as bacterial pneumonia or acute bronchitis. However, it fails significantly on the clinical features. It incorrectly states that the transcript does not explicitly mention fevers, whereas the patient specifically states she has been 'feeling like hot at night' in response to a question about fevers [P-4]. It also describes the cough as lasting 'approximately a month,' ignoring the patient's statement that she has had an intermittent cough for three months [P-2, P-13].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to explain how 'subjective nighttime fevers' contribute to the diagnosis, which was a specific requirement of the prompt. Instead, it substitutes 'fatigue' as evidence for systemic inflammation. It also misses the context provided in the Gold Answer regarding the transition from chronic to acute cough.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the transcript 'does not explicitly mention fevers' is a hallucination of absence (or a failure of extraction), as the patient explicitly reports subjective fevers in [P-4]. The rest of the information regarding sputum and cough is generally grounded, though the duration of the cough is slightly narrowed from the transcript's 3-month mention.",
    "relevance": "The answer is only partially relevant because it fails to address one of the three specific clinical features (subjective fever) requested in the prompt, choosing instead to argue that the feature is missing and providing an alternative (fatigue) that was not asked for."
