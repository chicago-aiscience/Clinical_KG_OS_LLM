  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Step-by-step: Gold Answer accurately lists triggers with citations (exercise P-9, cold P-9/P-11, pollen P-11), notes no other triggers, details clinician's allergy suspicion dialogue (D-12/P-12/D-13/D-31/P-31), family history (sister asthma P-32, no others), links to exacerbation via increased inhaler use (P-8), and clinician's med suggestion (D-43). Generated correctly identifies triggers and family history with similar citations, links to exacerbation (though cites P-1 more than P-8). Errors: Introduces non-existent 'knowledge graph'; incorrectly implies 'suspicion of asthma' despite diagnosed asthma (P-2); adds irrelevant goldfish as potential trigger; downplays clinician's direct allergy suspicion response ('that would make sense'). Some factual errors but core trigger/family/exacerbation relation correct.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold points: 3 triggers+cites (covered), no other triggers (missed), full allergy dialogue/suspicion (partially covered, misses 'that would make sense' and revisit), family details (covered partially), exacerbation link via P-8 (implied but not cited), med change suggestion (missed). Generated covers triggers, family, exacerbation symptoms/increased use (~70% core: triggers/family/exacerbation), adds extras like pets. Covers 50-79%.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims verifiable: triggers [P-9/P-11], family [P-32], symptoms [P-1], pets [P-39] grounded. Unverifiable/hallucinated: repeated 'knowledge graph' references/linkages (absent); 'suspicion of asthma' contradicts diagnosis [P-2/D-2]; goldfish as trigger focus (not implied); allergy suspicion vaguely tied without full transcript dialogue like D-13. Multiple hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses trigger/family relation to exacerbation (sections 1-3) and allergies (section 4/summary). Tangents: knowledge graph, pet/goldfish details (not central to question's doctor's allergy suspicion). Mostly focused."
