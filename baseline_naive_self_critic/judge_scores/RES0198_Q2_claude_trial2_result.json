  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies decongestants as the medication tried, accurately captures the patient's assessment as 'worked a little bit,' and correctly identifies Tylenol Cold as the doctor's OTC recommendation. All three core facts align with the Gold Answer and transcript.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all three required elements from the question: (1) prior medication tried, (2) patient's assessment of effectiveness, and (3) doctor's OTC recommendation. However, it lacks the nuanced context present in the Gold Answer, such as the patient's reasoning about why it 'worked a little bit' (stuffy to runny transition), the broader supportive care recommendations (hydration), and the timeline expectations (few weeks for resolution). It provides approximately 70% of the depth found in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the Generated Answer are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations [P-10] and [D-39]. The patient explicitly states trying decongestants and assessing them as working 'a little bit' in P-10, and the doctor recommends Tylenol Cold in D-39. No hallucinated or unverifiable information is present.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses all three parts of the question without any off-topic content. It focuses exclusively on: what medication was tried, the patient's assessment, and the doctor's OTC recommendation. The format is clear and well-organized with bullet points corresponding to each question component."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer accurately addresses all three components of the question with factually correct information properly cited from the transcript. It correctly identifies decongestants as the prior medication, the patient's 'worked a little bit' assessment, and Tylenol Cold as the doctor's recommendation. While faithful and relevant, it lacks some contextual depth present in the Gold Answer, such as the patient's reasoning about symptom transition, additional supportive care measures (hydration), and timeline expectations. The response is concise and well-structured but trades comprehensiveness for brevity."
