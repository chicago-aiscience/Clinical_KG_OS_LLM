  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the local symptoms of redness, tenderness, and soreness, as well as the systemic screening for joint pain and fever. However, it contains a major factual error by explicitly stating that the transcript does not indicate headache screening, whereas the doctor screens for it in [D-19] and the patient denies it in [P-19] and [P-20].",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: it fails to mention the patient's denial of the bullseye/target rash, the detail that the tick was 'stuck pretty good,' and most importantly, it misses the headache screening which was specifically requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is mostly grounded in the transcript for the symptoms it does list, but it fails on faithfulness by claiming the absence of information (headache screening) that is clearly present in the source text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant and follows the requested structure, but it fails to satisfy the prompt's specific requirement to include headaches in the systemic screening list."
