  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately matches the Gold Answer on the key factual elements: working diagnosis as a viral infection/common cold; supportive care with hydration and OTC Tylenol Cold; COVID swab testing with results in ~48 hours; and public health guidance to isolate at home and await further public health instructions. No contradictions to the Gold Answer were introduced. The added statement that COVID-19 was a potential cause is consistent with the doctor’s rationale for testing.",
    "completeness": "Covers most Gold Answer elements: diagnosis, both specific supportive care recommendations (hydration; OTC Tylenol Cold), the diagnostic test (COVID swab) and turnaround time (48 hours), and the public health guidance (isolation and follow-up instructions from public health).\nMisses two counseling/expectations points present in the Gold Answer: (1) symptoms may take “a few weeks” to resolve, and (2) there is “not much we can do besides supportive care.”",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all content is directly supported by [D-39]. The only minor ungrounded element is the meta-phrase “based on the clinical transcript and knowledge graph,” since no knowledge graph is referenced in the transcript; however, this does not add new clinical facts. All clinical claims (diagnosis, hydration, Tylenol Cold, COVID swab/48 hours, isolation, public health instructions) are grounded in the transcript.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses the question by summarizing the end-of-visit management plan, including diagnosis, supportive care, test ordered, and public health guidance, with no meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "The answer is accurate and highly relevant, but slightly incomplete because it omits the doctor’s counseling on expected symptom duration (“a few weeks”) and the statement that little beyond supportive care is available."
