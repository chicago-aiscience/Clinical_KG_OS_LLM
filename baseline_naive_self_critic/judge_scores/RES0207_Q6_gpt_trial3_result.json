{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect. The transcript clearly contains the doctor’s closing plan at D-37 and D-38, where the doctor says they will review the case with “the doctor who’s working today,” then return shortly to discuss next steps and possible tests. The Generated Answer incorrectly states the transcript ends at P-26 and that no follow-up discussion is present.",
    "completeness": "It misses essentially all key points from the Gold Answer: (1) review with another doctor involved in decision-making, (2) doctor will come back shortly, (3) possible tests and plan for how to move forward, (4) patient agreement, and (5) no specific tests/treatments named yet. Instead, it provides an incorrect claim of missing transcript content.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is not grounded in the provided transcript: it falsely claims the transcript ends at P-26 and that there are no subsequent doctor turns. This directly contradicts the included D-37 and D-38 segments. Therefore it contains major unfaithful statements about the source.",
    "relevance": "The answer is on-topic (it attempts to address next steps), but it fails to extract and report the actual next steps that are explicitly present in the transcript. It mainly focuses on an incorrect assertion about missing text, so it only weakly addresses the question."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer contradicts the transcript by claiming the consultation ends early and omits the explicitly stated next-step plan, resulting in very low accuracy, completeness, and faithfulness."
