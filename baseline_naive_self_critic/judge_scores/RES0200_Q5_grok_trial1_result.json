  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reports the patient's current smoking level (half pack/day) and historical increase (from 1-2 packs) matching Gold [P-44], and father's lung cancer/smoking [P-43], but incorrectly implies a direct familial risk link from lung cancer to COPD via 'knowledge graph' which is not in Gold or transcript; Gold relates personal smoking to COPD via timelines/consistency, which is omitted; doctor's acknowledgment of reduction [D-45] missed. Some factual errors in causal relations.",
    "completeness": "Covered: current/reduced smoking levels [P-44], father's lung cancer/smoking [P-43], patient's worry [P-43], mother healthy. Missed: doctor's positive note on cutting down/resources [D-45], cough 10 years [P-3], COPD diagnosis 5 years [P-2], timelines consistent with exposure, no recreational drugs [P-45], doctor's specific family hx question [D-43]. Covers ~60% of key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Smoking history and family facts verifiable [P-44, P-43]; 'knowledge graph' references, RISK_FACTOR labels, specific links (e.g., lung cancer --[FAMILY_HISTORY_OF]--> COPD), and 'anxiety and behaviors' are not in transcript (patient only worries, no behaviors mentioned), indicating multiple hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "Directly structures response around personal smoking history (levels/changes) and family history, explicitly relating both to COPD risk factors, perfectly matching question focus with no off-topic content."
