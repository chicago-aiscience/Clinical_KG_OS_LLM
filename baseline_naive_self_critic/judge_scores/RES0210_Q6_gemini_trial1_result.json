  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains significant factual errors. Most notably, it claims that the transcript lacks doctor statements (D-X), which is incorrect as the transcript clearly includes turns D-1 through D-44. Consequently, it fails to state the doctor's plan. It also incorrectly states that deep breathing was not explicitly named as a trigger, whereas the patient explicitly mentions it in [P-18]. It misses the alleviating/self-care factor of expectoration (bringing up gunk).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer: the doctor's specific plan to consult with a supervising physician, the patient's self-care and relief through expectoration, and the explicit identification of deep breathing as a major aggravating factor. It covers only about 40% of the required information accurately.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a major hallucination by claiming the source transcript only contains patient statements. This leads to a complete fabrication of the 'Doctor's Stated Plan' section. It also mentions a 'knowledge graph' which was not part of the provided context.",
    "relevance": "While the answer uses appropriate headers to address the prompt, the content within those headers is largely irrelevant or incorrect because it ignores the actual text of the doctor's turns and misrepresents the patient's specific statements about deep breathing and expectoration."
