  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reproduces the core management plan from the transcript: chest X‑ray and COVID swab ordered, chest-focused physical exam planned, self-isolation away from everyone including wife, results in 24–48 hours, and public health nurse to advise if positive. The only notable discrepancy vs the Gold Answer is the admission/discharge criterion: the doctor said the decision would be based on “those results” (i.e., the ordered test results) without explicitly adding “physical exam findings” as a formal criterion. Including physical exam findings is a minor inference and not explicitly stated as part of the disposition criteria.",
    "completeness": "All key elements in the Gold Answer are present: (1) planned chest/physical exam, (2) chest X‑ray, (3) COVID swab, (4) self-isolation away from everyone including wife, (5) results expected in 24–48 hours, (6) public health nurse guidance if positive, and (7) disposition (admit vs discharge) contingent on results with no numeric thresholds. Minor nuance: it does not explicitly state that the self-isolation instruction itself came from the doctor (though it is implied), while it correctly identifies the public health nurse as the source of instructions after a positive result.",
    "faithfulness": "Nearly all statements are directly supported by [D-37]. The added element that disposition would be based on “physical exam findings” is not explicitly stated (the transcript specifies “based on those results,” referring most plainly to the investigations). This is a small extrapolation but not a major fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response stays tightly focused on the requested components of the management plan (tests, physical exam, isolation instructions and source, timeline, and admit/discharge criteria) with no meaningful tangents."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is highly aligned with the Gold Answer and transcript, with only minor over-inference about physical exam findings being an explicit part of admit/discharge criteria and slight ambiguity about who issued the isolation instruction."
