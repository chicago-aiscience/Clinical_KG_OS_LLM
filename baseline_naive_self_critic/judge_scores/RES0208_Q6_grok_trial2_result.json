  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately reflects all factual details from the Gold Answer and transcript: diagnostic tests (chest X-ray and COVID swab), physical exam (chest-focused), self-isolation instructions (stay away from everyone including wife, self-isolate as much as possible), source (doctor for initial instructions, public health nurse for positive results), timeline (24-48 hours), and criteria (decision based on test and exam results). No factual errors or contradictions; minor phrasing differences do not impact accuracy.",

    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in [D-37] of the transcript: tests, exam, isolation instructions, nurse contact, timeline, and criteria ('based on those results' refers to exam, X-ray, swab). Accurate citation of [D-37]; no hallucinations or unverifiable details.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly addresses the question by structuring the response around the exact elements requested (tests, physical exam, self-isolation instructions and source, timeline, criteria), with no off-topic content."
