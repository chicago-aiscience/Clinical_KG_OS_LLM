  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "- Correctly identifies sore throat onset at ~4 days before consult and that it was very sore with dysphagia for food (matches [P-2]).\n- Does not state the documented progressive worsening of sore throat over the 4 days ([P-4]).\n- For dyspnea, the transcript clearly states difficulty breathing started yesterday ([P-8]) and is worsening ([P-9]) and constant ([P-10]); the Generated Answer is vague (“likely refers… though the transcript specifies only that ‘that’ started yesterday”), which is inaccurate because the symptom is explicitly identified as difficulty breathing.\n- Mentions muscle aches and reduced taste but fails to correctly place them in time (muscle aches started immediately after sore throat [P-26]; reduced taste started ~2 days ago [P-20] and is constant [P-21]).\n- Adds speculative framing around COVID context that is not needed for the symptom chronology.",
    "completeness": "Gold answer key points vs generated answer:\n- Sore throat timeline: onset 4 days ago (covered) + worsening over 4 days (missed) + impact on swallowing/fluids (partially covered: swallowing food mentioned; fluids OK not mentioned) + failed self-treatment (missed).\n- Fatigue/myalgias: started immediately after sore throat (missed), tired but not weak (missed; only muscle aches mentioned).\n- Taste change: started 2 days ago (missed), constant (missed), no smell loss (covered).\n- Dyspnea: started yesterday (implicitly but not clearly stated), worsening (missed), constant (missed), new/unlike before (missed).\nOverall, it captures only a minority of the required chronology and severity changes.",
    "faithfulness": "- Most statements are drawn from the transcript (sore throat severe; swallowing food; muscle aches; some taste change; no smell change).\n- However, it introduces speculation (“Given… COVID-19… this likely refers to…”) and incorrectly claims the transcript is nonspecific about what started yesterday; the transcript explicitly ties “started yesterday” to difficulty breathing.\n- Omits several transcript-supported details, but omission affects completeness more than faithfulness.",
    "relevance": "- The response attempts to provide a chronological symptom timeline, which is the core of the question.\n- However, it includes some unnecessary speculation about COVID context and fails to describe how each symptom changed in severity over time, limiting how well it answers the question."
