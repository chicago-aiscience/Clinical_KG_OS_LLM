  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly identifies the 'infectious exposure source' as the diagnosis (common cold/COVID-19) rather than the social history source requested (the nephew who attends daycare). Additionally, it incorrectly attributes the physician's management plan (isolation and swab) to the patient's chronic condition (diabetes), whereas the transcript and Gold Answer make it clear these were pandemic-related protocols and the doctor never explicitly linked the diabetes to the current presentation.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses 100% of the primary key point regarding the social history (the nephew). It also fails to mention the duration of symptoms and the important nuance that the transcript lacks an explicit link between the diabetes and the patient's immune function/infection risk.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates a causal link between the patient's type 1 diabetes and the doctor's recommendation for isolation and testing. The transcript states these actions are taken 'since right now we're in a pandemic,' not because of the patient's chronic condition.",
    "relevance": "The answer fails to address the specific constraint of the question, which asked for an exposure source identified 'through the social history.' By focusing on the diagnosis instead, it provides largely irrelevant information relative to the specific query."
