  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly claims that the clinician's dialogue is missing from the transcript. It states the text only contains patient responses [P-1] through [P-39], when the transcript clearly includes doctor responses [D-1] through [D-44]. Consequently, it fails to identify the COVID swab, medication changes, or the consultation with the supervising physician.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses 100% of the key points mentioned in the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the COVID-19 swab (D-29), the potential medication change (D-43), and the plan to consult the supervising physician (D-29, D-43).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a major hallucination regarding the source text. It claims the clinician's dialogue is absent, which is factually contradicted by the provided transcript containing 44 turns for the doctor.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question's specific requirements (diagnostic test, medication change, next steps) because it erroneously concludes the information is unavailable."
