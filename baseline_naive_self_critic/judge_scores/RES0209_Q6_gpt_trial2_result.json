  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is largely incorrect compared with the Gold Answer. The transcript clearly contains multiple clinician (D) statements outlining a plan (e.g., “probably will do a covid swab…” [D-29], “maybe all you need is a little change to your medications…” [D-43], and “I’m gonna go talk to the doctor…” [D-43]). The Generated Answer incorrectly asserts the text consists “exclusively” of patient responses and therefore claims the plan cannot be determined. It also adds unsupported clinical interpretations (e.g., goldfish exposure as a trigger; occupational/industrial asthma association) that are not in the transcript or Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements are almost entirely missing:\n- Missed: plan to do a COVID swab in the pandemic context.\n- Missed: suggestion of changing the asthma medication regimen to improve control (noting the patient only has a rescue bronchodilator).\n- Missed: goal of better control so the patient can play sports without needing medication every time.\n- Missed: next steps to consult/present to the supervising physician and return to the patient shortly.\nOverall coverage of Gold Answer points is <20%.",
    "faithfulness": "The response is not grounded in the provided transcript: it falsely claims there is no clinician dialogue, despite abundant D-lines. It introduces multiple speculative or fabricated details (e.g., specifying uncertainty about PCR vs antigen, implying a knowledge graph, and proposing goldfish as an asthma trigger/occupational asthma linkage). These are not verifiable from the transcript.",
    "relevance": "It partially engages with the question topic (diagnostic testing, medication change, supervising physician) but ultimately does not answer what the clinician’s plan actually was, despite the plan being explicitly present in the transcript. The added speculative clinical discussion is not what was asked."
