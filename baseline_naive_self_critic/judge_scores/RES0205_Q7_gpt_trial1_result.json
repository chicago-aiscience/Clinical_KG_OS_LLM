  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly states the overall two-week duration of cough, early flu-like symptoms, mucus description as whitish/clear, mucus lasting 4–5 days, transition to dry cough after ~day 4–5, and that other symptoms resolved within 3–4 days. However, it contains a notable timeline imprecision by labeling a separate “Mucus Phase (Days 4–5),” which can be read as mucus occurring specifically on days 4–5 rather than spanning the first 4–5 days. It also frames cough-related chest discomfort as “chest pain,” which could be misread as true chest pain despite the patient denying chest pain except soreness from coughing.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer elements included: (1) cough present for two weeks, (2) early flu-like symptoms, (3) mucus appearance (whitish/clear), (4) mucus duration (first 4–5 days), (5) transition to dry cough after day 4–5, (6) other symptoms resolved by ~3–4 days, (7) cough-related chest soreness. Missing from Gold Answer: sore throat presence and its 2–3 day duration, runny nose specifically, explicit statement of no fevers, the cough’s intensity staying the same over two weeks, the cough’s frequency staying stable and estimated 3–4 times/hour, spontaneous nature/no triggers, COVID test negative at onset, and that the patient stayed home awaiting improvement.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are grounded in the transcript with appropriate support. Minor issues: reference to a “knowledge graph” (not part of the transcript) and the potential overstatement of “chest pain” despite the patient’s distinction (no chest pain, only soreness when coughing a lot). The “Days 4–5” mucus phase wording is more an interpretation/wording error than a fabrication.",
    "relevance": "The response is largely focused on the requested symptom timeline (onset, mucus duration/appearance, transition to dry cough, resolution of other symptoms). However, it does not address several parts of the question about how cough intensity and frequency changed over time (stable), and it omits fever status and trigger information, reducing how directly it answers the full prompt."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and transcript-based for the basic timeline, but it omits multiple key progression details (sore throat/runny nose timing, fever absence, cough frequency/intensity stability, triggers, COVID test/home isolation) and has minor wording/timeline imprecision."
