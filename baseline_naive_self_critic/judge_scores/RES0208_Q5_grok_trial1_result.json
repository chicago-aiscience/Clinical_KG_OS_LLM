  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer incorrectly states that the provided transcript segments ([D-36] through [P-9]) lack information on the grandson's visit, daycare, cold symptoms, travel, or client visits, which directly contradicts the Gold Answer and the full transcript where these details are explicitly present (e.g., [P-23] for grandson, [D-24/P-24] for travel, [P-31/P-32] for client visits). It fails to connect the grandson exposure temporally to symptom onset or note exclusions of other pathways, introducing major factual errors including a non-existent 'knowledge graph'.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) Grandkids visited last weekend, grandson at daycare with cold ([P-23]); (2) Family unaware of illness; (3) Symptoms started couple days after ([P-1]); (4) Doctor acknowledges exposure ([D-24]); (5) Travel outside province denied ([D-24/P-24]); (6) No recent client visits despite occasional in-person work ([P-31/P-32]); (7) These exclusions point to grandson as likely source supporting infection assessment ([D-36]). Generated Answer covers 0% of these, instead focusing on symptoms and falsely claiming absence of exposure data.",
    "faithfulness": "Generated Answer hallucinates a 'knowledge graph' (KG) not present in the transcript or input; misrepresents transcript coverage by claiming specific segments exclude key exposure details, when the full transcript includes them (e.g., [P-23], [P-31]); symptom summaries partially align but are not central; largely fabricated claims about missing information undermine grounding.",
    "relevance": "The answer partially engages the question on exposure pathways by denying their presence in the transcript but devotes significant space to irrelevant symptom correlations and COVID links not asked; does not address the core connection to doctor's assessment or exclusions, making it largely tangential."
