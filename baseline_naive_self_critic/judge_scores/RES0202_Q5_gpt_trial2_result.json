  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer captures the general idea that school attendance was considered a possible source, but it contains important factual errors and contradictions relative to the Gold Answer/transcript. It incorrectly states symptoms began after returning home on Thursday; the transcript indicates he came home from school Wednesday and symptoms started that night [P-1]. It also incorrectly claims there is no information about whether the school notified the family; the mother explicitly states the school had not contacted them about anything [P-39]. It further implies there were no known sick contacts at school, whereas the mother’s point was that it was “kinda hard to say” at school (unknown), not definitively none [P-38].",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points missing or misrepresented: (1) Mother suspected he could have caught COVID at school [P-2] (not clearly included). (2) No known sick contacts outside of school [P-38] (not stated). (3) At school it was uncertain/“kinda hard to say,” not “no known sick contacts at school” [P-38]. (4) School had not contacted them about exposures [P-39] (explicitly missed/contradicted). (5) School required a COVID test for return and to notify other families of exposure [P-41] (omitted). (6) Additional narrowing factors (no travel [P-40], no home environmental exposures [P-37]) are omitted (though these are secondary to the question). Overall, less than half of the required elements are accurately covered.",
    "faithfulness": "Several statements are not grounded or are contradicted by the transcript: the Thursday timing is incorrect vs [P-1]; using “not running outside much” [P-8] as support for lack of sick contacts is not what that line refers to; and stating the transcript contains no information about school notifications contradicts [P-39]. These issues reflect multiple unfaithful claims.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address school attendance, sick contacts at school vs outside school, and school notification. However, it fails to report the actual notification status and misstates the school vs outside-school sick contact situation, which are central to the question. Still, it remains generally on-topic without major tangents."
