  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures the core diagnosis as a viral infection/common cold from [D-39], supportive care (hydration and Tylenol Cold), diagnostic swab for COVID with 48-hour results, and public health isolation/follow-up instructions, matching the Gold Answer's facts. Minor discrepancies include phrasing the diagnosis as 'common cold caused by a viral infection' (synonymous but slightly reworded), adding 'to rule it out' for COVID (plausible implication but not verbatim), and omitting explicit expectation-setting about symptom duration ('a few weeks') and limited treatment options, but no major errors or contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Covers all key points: diagnosis (viral/common cold), specific supportive care (hydration, OTC Tylenol Cold), diagnostic test (COVID swab, 48h results), public health (isolation at home/not see others, further public health instructions). Misses Gold's explicit inclusion of expectation-setting ('symptoms take a few weeks to resolve' and 'not much besides supportive care') and minor details like 'based on stuffy/runny nose presentation' and 'swab today'; covers ~90% of content.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims directly verifiable in [D-39] with accurate citations: diagnosis phrasing, hydration, Tylenol Cold, swab/48h, isolation, public health follow-up. Minor additions like 'knowledge graph' (not in transcript) and 'to rule it out' (inferred but not hallucinated as transcript links symptoms to COVID swab); no fabricated facts.",
    "relevance": "Perfectly structured to address the question's elements (diagnosis, supportive care, diagnostic test, public health guidance) with no off-topic content or tangents."
