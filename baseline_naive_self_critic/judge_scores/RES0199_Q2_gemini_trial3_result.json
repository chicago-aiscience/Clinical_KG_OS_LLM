  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies Tylenol as the medication taken for headaches, consistent with the Gold Answer and the transcript. It also accurately lists the doctor's recommendations for supportive measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep) and additional medications (antipyretics, NSAIDs) as stated in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers most key points from the Gold Answer, including the specific medication at home, the targeted symptom, and the doctor's medicinal/supportive recommendations. However, it misses the COVID-19 swab test and the 14-day isolation instructions, which the Gold Answer includes as part of the 'management plan'. It also omits the patient's self-initiated hydration mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "All information provided in the Generated Answer is directly supported by the transcript, specifically referencing turns [P-3], [P-1], and [D-52]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly and concisely addresses all parts of the question. It differentiates clearly between the patient's pre-visit actions and the doctor's plan."
