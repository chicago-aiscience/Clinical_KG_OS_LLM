  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly explains the 72-hour attachment duration calculation based on the Friday/Saturday timeline. However, it is factually incorrect regarding the second part of the question. It explicitly claims that the transcript does not mention the 'Ontario Lyme disease distribution map' or Strathroy's position on it, whereas turn [D-13] in the transcript contains exactly this information.",
    "completeness": "The answer covers the first half of the question regarding the attachment duration but fails to provide any information for the second half, erroneously stating that the information is missing from the source text. It misses the key points about Strathroy being a 'concerning point' on the map.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits a 'negative hallucination' by claiming information is not present in the transcript when it clearly is (Turn [D-13]). While the first part is grounded, the denial of the second part's evidence is unfaithful to the provided text.",
    "relevance": "The answer is partially relevant as it addresses both parts of the prompt, but its failure to find and interpret the relevant section of the transcript makes the second half of the response unhelpful."
