    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains several significant factual errors. It states the tightness 'has progressed to include difficulty breathing' suggesting worsening, when the Gold Answer clearly states symptoms have been 'staying the same' [P-2]. It omits that the patient first noticed symptoms 'while out on a walk' [P-4], instead vaguely saying they 'began approximately three days before.' It fails to mention key exacerbating factors like 'getting up out of a chair' [P-9]. Most critically, it completely misrepresents the impact on daily walking - stating the patient 'has maintained their daily walking routine' when the Gold Answer clearly indicates they reduced from 'couple of walks per day' to 'just one walk daily' [P-22]. It also includes irrelevant clinical speculation about asthma exacerbation and cardiac differentials not present in the Gold Answer.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers only about 40% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses: (1) that nothing particular triggered onset [P-3], (2) symptoms 'staying the same' progression [P-2], (3) baseline presence with exacerbations [P-9, P-10], (4) specific trigger of 'getting up out of a chair' [P-9], (5) taking 'big breath in' as trigger [P-9], (6) the critical functional impact of reducing from multiple to one walk daily [P-22], (7) no missed work time [P-21, P-22], and (8) the agreement between patient and doctor about noticeable limitation despite not being dramatically impaired [P-22, P-23].",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains claims not well-supported by the transcript. While it correctly cites symptoms being present for three days and exacerbated by walking, it makes unsupported claims about 'progression' and symptom evolution. The statement that 'the severity of the symptoms has prompted the patient to seek medical attention' is an interpretation not directly stated. Most problematic is the claim the patient 'has maintained their daily walking routine' which directly contradicts P-22 where the patient states they've reduced from multiple walks to one walk daily. The inclusion of doctor's diagnostic speculation (asthma exacerbation, cardiac differential) is factual but not relevant to the question asked.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer addresses most aspects of the question but includes significant irrelevant content. The question asks about: (1) how symptoms developed and evolved - partially addressed but inaccurately, (2) what activity when first appeared - inadequately addressed, (3) whether getting better/worse/same - incorrectly addressed, (4) specific exacerbating activities - partially addressed with key omissions, and (5) impact on walking routine - incorrectly addressed. However, approximately 30% of the response consists of irrelevant clinical information about doctor's diagnostic reasoning, asthma exacerbation suspicions, and cardiac differentials that don't answer the specific question about symptom development and evolution."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluation dimensions. It contains major factual errors, most notably incorrectly stating the patient maintained their walking routine when they actually reduced it significantly, and mischaracterizing symptom progression as worsening when they remained stable. The response covers less than half of the Gold Answer's key points, omitting critical details about symptom onset, specific exacerbating factors, and functional impact. While most claims can be traced to the transcript, some interpretations lack direct support, and the claim about maintaining walking routine contradicts the source material. The response is only moderately relevant, with substantial content devoted to clinical reasoning irrelevant to the question. Overall, this answer would provide an incomplete and partially inaccurate picture of the patient's symptom development and evolution."
