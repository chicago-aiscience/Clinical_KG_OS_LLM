  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies loss of taste, body aches, feverishness, and loss of appetite. However, it misinterprets transcript [P-8]—the patient was describing a dry cough 'on its way,' not a 'dry throat.' It also includes descriptions of 'laborious breathing' as an additional symptom, whereas the prompt specifically asked for symptoms 'beyond' the chief complaint of shortness of breath.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer misses several key symptoms mentioned in the Gold Answer and transcript: the diminished sense of smell [P-6], the dry cough [P-7, P-8], the sore throat [P-9], the headaches [P-11], and general weakness [P-2]. It covers approximately 44% of the specific symptoms detailed in the Gold Answer (4 out of 9 distinct symptoms).",
    "faithfulness": "The answer is generally grounded in the transcript, though it slightly misinterprets the patient's description of a dry cough as a 'dry throat' and alters the quote in [P-4] slightly (changing 'don't' to 'didn't').",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer follows the requested structure and addresses the specific categories (Sensory, URI, Musculoskeletal, Constitutional). However, it includes details about the difficulty of breathing which the prompt explicitly asked to move beyond."
