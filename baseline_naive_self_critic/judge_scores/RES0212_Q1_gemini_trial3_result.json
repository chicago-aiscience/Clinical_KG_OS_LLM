  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer incorrectly identifies the cough duration as one month, whereas the transcript and gold answer specify three months (P-2). It also fails to mention the subjective fevers (feeling 'hot at night') and specific sputum characteristics like the absence of blood or foul smell. However, it correctly identifies the greenish color, chest pain during coughing, and fatigue/sleep issues.",
    "completeness": "The answer is significantly incomplete. It misses the 3-month timeline, the lack of blood/odor in sputum, subjective fevers, and the impact on exercise. More importantly, the 'Explicitly Denied Symptoms' section provides paragraph references instead of actually naming the symptoms denied (night sweats, weight loss), and it omits other denied symptoms like nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and sick contacts.",
    "faithfulness": "The content is generally grounded in the transcript, though the attribution of the one-month duration to [P-1] is inaccurate as that paragraph does not specify a timeframe, and the overall duration mentioned in the transcript is three months.",
    "relevance": "The answer addresses all parts of the question but lacks the specificity required for the 'explicitly denied' section, rendering that portion of the response unhelpful as it does not name the symptoms as requested by the prompt ('which symptoms did she... deny')."
