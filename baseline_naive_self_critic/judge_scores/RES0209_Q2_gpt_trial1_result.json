  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated answer correctly identifies the patient’s only asthma medication as a bronchodilator/rescue medication and that it is administered via an inhaler/puffer, consistent with the transcript (D-7/P-7) and gold answer. It also correctly states the clinician asked about a medication taken every day (daily controller) that the patient does not have (D-5/P-5). Minor issues: it cites P-1 for route of administration (inhaler), but the explicit inhaler/puffer detail is actually at D-7/P-7; and it characterizes the missing controller as “specifically a controller inhaler,” whereas the transcript only indicates a daily medication, not the exact form.",
    "completeness": "Key gold points covered: (1) bronchodilator is the only asthma medication; (2) it functions as rescue/acute relief rather than daily maintenance; (3) clinician asked about a daily controller medication the patient lacks. Key points missed or under-specified: (a) explicit ‘as-needed’ phrasing (D-4/P-4, D-6); (b) explicit confirmation patient takes no other medications (D-6/P-6; D-30/P-30); (c) explicit term ‘puffer’ (D-7/P-7). It also omits the gold answer’s clinical significance discussion (increased frequency suggesting inadequate control), though that is not strictly required by the question.",
    "faithfulness": "Most statements are supported by the transcript, but there are minor grounding/citation problems: route of administration is attributed to P-1 rather than D-7/P-7, and the claim ‘specifically a controller inhaler’ is more specific than what is stated (the clinician asked about a daily medication, not necessarily an inhaler). No major hallucinations beyond that over-specificity.",
    "relevance": "The response stays focused on the asked elements: current asthma medication, how it is administered, and the daily controller medication the doctor asked about that the patient does not have. Some added trigger/use-context (exercise/cold) is minor and not distracting."

  "summary": "Mostly accurate and relevant, but it misses several explicit transcript-supported details (as-needed wording, denial of other meds, ‘puffer’) and slightly over-specifies the type of controller while using an imprecise citation for administration."
