  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Core points align with the Gold Answer: she is worried about a cardiac cause and explicitly links this to her father’s heart attack “last year” in his 50s; she is trying to quit smoking and finds it hard; she is stressed by school and has an anxiety history. However, the answer overstates/introduces unsupported specifics (e.g., “knowledge graph” relationships; “family history … a risk factor for chest pain” as stated; “knowledge graph explicitly states stress triggers chest pain”), which are not part of the transcript/Gold Answer framing. These are not catastrophic errors, but they do reduce factual fidelity to the provided material.",
    "completeness": "Covers the three required domains (family history, smoking, psychosocial stress) and gives at least one transcript detail for each. Misses several Gold Answer details that illustrate the connections: father now seeing “a lot of heart doctors” [P-30]; uncertainty of further family history and paternal grandfather’s accidental death [P-30]; smoking timeline (started ~18, up to ~10/day for 2 years, cut down recently) [P-18]; key stressor specifics (Masters of social work, thesis/final time crunch) [P-15, P-16]; living alone/limited social contact [P-26, P-27]; nervous about running [P-28]; physiologic anxiety link (breathing faster when nervous; anxiety attacks may be returning) [P-19, P-22].",
    "faithfulness": "Several elements are not grounded in the transcript: repeated references to a “knowledge graph” and explicit causal links attributed to it; framing family history as a direct “risk factor for chest pain” and “genetic link” language is not stated by patient/clinician in the excerpt. The quoted transcript snippets used are accurate, and most of the narrative interpretation (fear, stress, quitting smoking difficulty) is supported, but there are multiple unverifiable additions.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how family history, smoking, and psychosocial stressors contribute to and interact with her heart-disease concern, with supporting transcript quotes. Minor distraction from the prompt due to the “knowledge graph” discussion, but overall remains focused."
