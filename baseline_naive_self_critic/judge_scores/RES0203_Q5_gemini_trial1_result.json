  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually incorrect. It states that the patient did not identify a specific exposure event, whereas in transcript [P-18], the patient explicitly mentions a hiking trip two weeks prior where people brushed by them as the only possible source of infection. The Gold Answer correctly identifies this event.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses the primary piece of information requested by the prompt (the hiking trip). It fails to mention the patient's residence with family and the specific social distancing context mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer claims the patient 'does not describe a specific event,' which is a direct contradiction of the source transcript at [P-18] and [P-19]. This constitutes a failure to ground the response in the provided text.",
    "relevance": "While the answer is factually wrong, it is highly relevant in its structure, attempting to address the two specific parts of the user's question directly."
