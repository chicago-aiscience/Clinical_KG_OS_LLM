  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer only identifies two conditions (Cardiac Issues/Heart Attack and Anxiety Attacks), while the Gold Answer lists six specific conditions ruled out (trauma/musculoskeletal, cardiac disease/angina, infectious illness, asthma, primary dyspnea, inherited arrhythmia). It partially touches on cardiac screening via family history and triggers but inaccurately frames it and completely misses the other four. Crucially, it incorrectly claims anxiety attacks were 'ruled out' based on [P-20], whereas the transcript and Gold suggest anxiety is a likely cause, not excluded; patient's response links palpitations to anxiety but chest pain contextually aligns with stress/anxiety triggers throughout. Significant factual errors and contradictions with Gold.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Trauma [D-5]; (2) Cardiac angina [D-10,D-20,D-11]; (3) Infection [D-12,D-27]; (4) Asthma [D-23,D-24]; (5) Dyspnea [D-19]; (6) Arrhythmia [D-31,D-32]. Generated covers vague partial cardiac (triggers/exertion/family) overlapping ~1-2 points (<20%), misses trauma, infection, asthma, dyspnea entirely, and adds non-ruled-out anxiety.",
    "faithfulness": "Some grounding: patient's family history worry [P-8], heart flutter question/response [D-20/P-20], triggers discussed (e.g., [D-10]). However, hallucinates 'doctor likely inquiring about family history prompted by patient' (doctor asks unprompted [D-30]); infers anxiety screening from patient details without doctor directly screening to rule it out; claims 'excluded chest pain as sporadic/independent' misreads [P-20] which rules out palpitations outside anxiety, not chest pain; vague 'distinction of triggers later' not tied to specific lines. Multiple interpretive hallucinations and inaccurate citations.",
    "relevance": "Structured as list of screened/ruled-out conditions with inquiries, directly mimicking question format; no off-topic content or tangents, fully focused despite errors."
