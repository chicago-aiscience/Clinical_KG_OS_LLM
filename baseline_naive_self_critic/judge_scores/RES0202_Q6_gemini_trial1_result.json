  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and matches the gold answer and transcript precisely. It correctly identifies the diagnostic test (COVID swab), the turnaround time (24-48 hours), the isolation period (14 days), the alternative diagnosis (another viral illness), the possibility of false negatives, and all listed warning signs (high temperature, seizures, weakness, dizziness, fainting).",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers almost all key points. It misses the specific context mentioned in the gold answer regarding asthma being a differential if the fever were absent. It also omits the explicit statement that no medications were prescribed and that the approach was 'watchful waiting', though it captures the essence of the management plan.",
    "faithfulness": "All claims in the generated answer are directly supported by the transcript, specifically citations [D-44] and [D-45]. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses every specific component of the multi-part question without including extraneous information."
