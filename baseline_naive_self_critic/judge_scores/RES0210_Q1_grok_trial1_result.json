  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer's facts are fully consistent with the Gold Answer and transcript: cough described as 'pretty bad' for 'a couple of days' matches initial patient report [P-1]; sputum as 'yellow custard' with 'spots of red' exactly matches [P-6]; chest pain on the 'right' side matches [P-17]; chills reported matches [P-9]. No factual errors, contradictions, or inaccuracies in stated claims.",
    "completeness": "Key points from Gold Answer: (1) cough worsening from raspy Friday to severe Sunday - partially covered (cough mentioned but no timeline); (2) sputum 'yellow custard' with 'little spots of red' (blood-tinged) simultaneous on Sunday - description covered fully but onset/timeline missed; (3) right-sided chest pain constant, dull, always there even lying down, worse with coughing/deep breathing - only location covered, quality and aggravating factors missed; (4) subjective fevers from Monday, felt hot without measuring, persisting - completely missed; (5) chills especially last two days - covered; (6) mild dyspnea on exertion (winded on stairs) - missed; (7) sore/raw throat after coughing - missed; (8) runny nose ~week ago resolved - missed; (9) no weight loss - missed. Covers ~20-49% of key points (full sputum desc and chills, partial cough and pain location).",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly verifiable in the transcript with accurate citations: cough [P-1], sputum [P-6], chest pain right side [P-17], chills [P-9]. No unverifiable details, hallucinations, or fabrications; fully grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer directly lists patient-reported symptoms in bullet points addressing cough, sputum description (color/appearance), chest pain location, and chills (systemic), aligning with the question's focus; lacks pain quality and fever but contains no off-topic content or tangents, remaining mostly relevant."
