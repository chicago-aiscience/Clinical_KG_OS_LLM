  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms used for the doctor's assessment (fever, fatigue, cough). However, it fundamentally fails by claiming that the transcript does not contain information regarding the grandson's visit, daycare, travel, or client visits. These details are explicitly present in the transcript (P-23, P-24, P-31, P-32).",
    "completeness": "The answer misses the most significant portions of the Gold Answer. It fails to mention the timing of the grandson's visit relative to symptom onset, the specific exclusion of travel outside the province, and the exclusion of recent in-person client visits. It only addresses the general symptom-based assessment.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains a 'meta-hallucination' by asserting that specific information is absent from the transcript when it is clearly provided in the source text. It incorrectly cites a limited range of segments ([D-36] through [P-9]) to justify this omission, ignoring the actual content provided.",
    "relevance": "While the first half of the answer addresses the general 'suspected infection' part of the question, it completely fails to address the specific connection to the grandson and the excluded exposure pathways, which were the primary focus of the prompt."
