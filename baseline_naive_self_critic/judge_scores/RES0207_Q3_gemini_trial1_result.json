  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually accurate and consistent with the Gold Answer regarding the link between the missed Keppra dose and the seizure. It correctly identifies the specific transcript evidence [P-9] where the patient makes the connection.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer misses several specific details included in the Gold Answer: it does not mention the daughter's birthday or the disrupted dinner routine as the reason for the missed dose [P-24], it fails to note that the patient's admission was voluntary and not prompted by medication questions [D-9], and it omits the patient's remark about seizures being infrequent [P-9].",
    "faithfulness": "The clinical details provided are faithful to the transcript. However, the response includes a minor hallucination regarding the source material, referencing a 'knowledge graph and clinical notes' which were not provided in the prompt context.",
    "relevance": "The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both the causal link and the evidence of the patient's recognition without extraneous information."
