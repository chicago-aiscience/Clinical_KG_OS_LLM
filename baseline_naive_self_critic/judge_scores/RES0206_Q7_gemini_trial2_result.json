  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer is factually consistent with both the gold answer and the source transcript. It correctly identifies the 3-day timeline, the specific symptoms (increased cough, green-yellow sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea), the worsening trend, and the patient's assessment that this is the worst episode she has experienced.",
    "completeness": "While the generated answer covers the main points (evolution, worsening, and comparative severity), it misses several specific details present in the gold answer. Specifically, it omits the frequency of rescue inhaler use (once every two weeks), the functional baseline and decline regarding walking her dog, the mention of a possible fever, and the specific history of two emergency department visits in three years as a metric for comparing past severity.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the transcript. All clinical claims are supported by patient statements (e.g., P-1, P-3). Although it mentions a 'knowledge graph' which is external to the text, the actual clinical content remains grounded in the provided dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer directly addresses all parts of the multi-part question: the evolution from baseline, the direction of symptoms (worsening), and the comparison to prior episodes."
