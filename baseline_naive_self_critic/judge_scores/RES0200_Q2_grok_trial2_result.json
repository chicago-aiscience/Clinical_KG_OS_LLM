  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately lists the respiratory inhalers (Ventolin/Ventilin and Spiriva from [P-11]) and non-respiratory drug (Torva Staten/atorvastatin for cholesterol from [P-38]), which matches the Gold Answer. It correctly notes the history of blood pressure medications discontinued without approval (from [P-34]), consistent with Gold. The Ventolin frequency is described as 'a lot more recently' from [P-11], which is factually true but less precise than Gold's 'approximately 10 times over the past week' from [P-12]; however, there are no factual errors or contradictions with Gold or transcript. Score: 5",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: (1) Ventolin (as needed for relief), (2) Spiriva, (3) Ventolin ~10 times past week [P-12], (4) atorvastatin for cholesterol, (5) previously prescribed diuretic for BP [P-35], (6) discontinued on own without approval [P-36]. Generated covers (1 partially as relief/more use), (2 fully), (3 partially/vaguely as more recently), (4 fully), (5 partially as BP meds), (6 fully). Misses exact frequency quantification and 'diuretic' specificity. Covers ~80-90% of key points. Score: 4",
    "faithfulness": "All claims are directly grounded in the transcript with accurate citations: inhalers [P-11], Torva Staten/cholesterol [P-38], BP history/discontinuation [P-34]. Ventolin 'lot more recently' verifiable in [P-11]; no unverifiable or hallucinated details. Score: 5",
    "relevance": "The answer is structured perfectly to address the question's three parts (prior meds incl. inhalers/non-resp, Ventolin frequency past week, discontinued med), with no irrelevant content or tangents. Score: 5"
