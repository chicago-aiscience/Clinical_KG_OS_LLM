  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Gold Answer states the missed Keppra dose on the night of the seizure due to disrupted dinner routine (P-24) directly connects to the seizure (P-8), with patient recognition in P-9 ('I kind of forgot to take my med. I think that might have yeah'), noting it's voluntary after D-9, unusual frequency, one-time lapse, no clinician confirmation. Generated Answer correctly identifies the causal connection via missed dose to seizure and patient's explicit recognition in P-9 quote, naming Keppra (P-23), but omits timing (same night), reason (daughter's birthday P-24), voluntary context (post D-9), rarity ('usually don't get seizures often'), and specifies no clinician assessment. Minor addition of 'frequency linked to adherence' is a reasonable inference from P-9 but not verbatim. Core facts match, minor discrepancies in detail coverage.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: 1) Missed Keppra → seizure same night (P-8,P-24); 2) Patient spontaneous recognition (P-9 post D-9); 3) Quote implying causality; 4) Unusual/rare seizures usually (P-9); 5) One-time lapse due to birthday disrupting routine (P-24); 6) No clinician causality confirmation. Generated covers: 1) Missed dose → seizure causality; 2) Patient identification (P-9 quote); 3) Seizure mention (P-8); 4) Keppra (P-23). Misses: same-night timing explicitly, birthday/routine details (P-24), voluntary context, rarity phrasing, clinician note. Covers ~80-90% of core (connection + patient evidence), misses elaborative details.",
    "faithfulness": "Transcript verifies: seizure previous night (P-8), epilepsy/seizure disorder (P-8), forgot med thinks caused it (P-9), Keppra (P-23), low usual frequency (P-9), lapse explanation (P-24). Citations P-8,P-9,P-23 accurate. Hallucinations: 'based on the provided knowledge graph and clinical notes' (no such items in input, only transcript); 'clarified that the frequency of their seizures is linked to adherence' (inferred/plausible from P-9 but not direct claim, patient implies via rarity + this miss). Some unverifiable details (knowledge graph major issue), but core claims grounded; not multiple fabrications.",
    "relevance": "Question asks for missed dose-seizure connection + evidence of patient's recognition of causal link. Generated directly explains connection (missed dose precipitates seizure) with transcript evidence (P-8,P-9,P-23 quote), fully on-topic, no tangents."
