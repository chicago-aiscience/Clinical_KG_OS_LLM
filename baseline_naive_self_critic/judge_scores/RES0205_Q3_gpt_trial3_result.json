  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies COVID-19 as the diagnosis investigated, accurately links the investigation to the patient’s hospital employment and viral/flu-like symptoms with persistent cough, and correctly reports that the COVID test was negative. No statements contradict the Gold Answer or the transcript.",
    "completeness": "Key Gold Answer points covered: (1) COVID-19 was investigated; (2) prompting evidence included hospital worker status, flu-like symptoms (sore throat/runny nose) and persistent cough; (3) social/occupational concern about coughing at work; (4) testing was negative. Key points missed: (a) the patient’s statement about wearing PPE/being careful; (b) timing of the test (at symptom onset ~2 weeks ago); (c) the patient stayed home awaiting symptom resolution before returning to work. Overall, it captures most but not all details.",
    "faithfulness": "All included claims are supported by the transcript: persistent cough (P-2), initial flu-like symptoms/runny nose (P-14) and sore throat (P-13), hospital clerk (P-34), coworkers scared (P-35), COVID test negative (P-35). No clear hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The response directly answers all parts of the question (diagnosis, evidence prompting investigation, and test result) with no meaningful tangents."
