  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer accurately captures all core elements of the management plan from the Gold Answer, including the COVID-19 swab, 14-day isolation, contact tracing if positive, alternative viral illness possibility, and all listed supportive care measures (hydration, nutrition, sleep, Tylenol for fever, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches). Minor discrepancies include omitting the specific 24-48 hour results timeline mentioned in Gold and adding extraneous 'Knowledge Graph' confirmations not present in Gold or transcript, but no factual contradictions.",
    "completeness": "Key points covered: diagnostic swab [yes, but misses 24-48 hrs timing], 14-day self-isolation [yes], contact tracing if positive [yes], alternative diagnosis [yes, noted in supportive context], all supportive care (hydration, nutritious food, sleep, Tylenol for fevers, Tylenol/NSAIDs for aches) [yes fully]. Missed: explicit results timing and 'no prescription medications beyond supportive' statement. Covers ~90% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "All primary claims (swab, isolation duration, contact tracing condition, supportive care details) are directly verifiable in [D-52] of the transcript with accurate citations. However, additions like '(Knowledge Graph confirms... [PROCEDURE] covid)' and similar for contact tracing are not in the transcript, introducing minor unverifiable/hallucinated details, though core content remains grounded.",
    "relevance": "The answer is perfectly structured and focused on the question's requested elements (diagnostic test, isolation duration, contact tracing conditions, supportive care), with no off-topic content or tangents."
