{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains a significant factual error: it claims that 'olfactory function is affected' because the patient said 'not smell'. In the transcript, the patient states they lost taste 'but not smell', meaning their sense of smell was preserved. Additionally, the Generated Answer introduces a 'Knowledge Graph' which does not exist in the source transcript or prompt. It correctly identifies sore throat and reduced taste as key symptoms.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer is incomplete. It misses two major symptoms highlighted in the Gold Answer and the transcript: difficulty breathing (started yesterday, worsening) and muscle aches/fatigue (started after the sore throat). It also ignores the contextual clues about exposure (grocery store/bank) and travel history mentioned in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer hallucinates the existence of a 'Medical Knowledge Graph' to support its reasoning. It also misinterprets the patient's denial of smell loss ('not smell') as a sign that olfactory function was affected.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant to the question, specifically addressing the combination of symptoms and the specific query regarding taste vs. smell, even though its interpretation of the latter was factually flawed."
