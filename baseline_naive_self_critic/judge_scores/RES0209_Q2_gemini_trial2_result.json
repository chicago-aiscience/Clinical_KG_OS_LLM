{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the medication as a bronchodilator and the method of administration as an inhaler (referred to as a 'puffer' in the transcript). It also correctly identifies the daily controller medication as the type the doctor asked about. All facts align with the Gold Answer and the source text.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers all parts of the question. However, compared to the Gold Answer, it omits the specific frequency of use (once every two weeks vs. 5-6 times a week) and the specific phrasing the doctor used to describe the controller ('one that you take every day no matter what'), which provides more context to the 'type' of medication asked about.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is grounded in the transcript. It correctly identifies the bronchodilator and the lack of a daily controller. The citation [P-1] for 'administered as an inhaler' is slightly inaccurate as the term 'puffer' appears later in the transcript (D-7/P-7), but it is a valid clinical interpretation of the term bronchodilator in this context.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the three components of the user's question without unnecessary filler."
