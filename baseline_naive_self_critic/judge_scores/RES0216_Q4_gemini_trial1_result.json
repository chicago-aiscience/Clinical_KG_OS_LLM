  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies the condition as cardiac ischemia. However, it incorrectly claims that the doctor cited 'difficulty breathing' as evidence for deprioritizing the condition. In fact, the transcript (D-36) shows the doctor cited the patient *not* getting out of breath as the evidence. The answer also includes a logic statement about 'no pain' ruling out ischemia, which is a medical oversimplification not present in the doctor's nuanced reasoning.",
    "completeness": "The answer misses several key points from the Gold Answer, specifically the absence of anxiety, sweating, and the feeling of impending doom (D-6). It also fails to mention the doctor's specific observation about the lack of exertional dyspnea (getting out of breath), which was a primary factor in the Gold Answer.",
    "faithfulness": "The generated answer significantly fails faithfulness by hallucinating a 'knowledge graph' and a specific structured finding (`[FINDING] no pain --[RULES_OUT]--> [DIAGNOSIS] cardiac ischemia`) that does not exist in the provided source transcript.",
    "relevance": "The answer is relevant as it directly attempts to identify the condition and the symptoms cited by the doctor, though it fails on the specific details."
