{
  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the symptoms mentioned in the doctor's summary (D-36). However, it miscategorizes 'difficulty breathing' as a component of the general infection process, whereas the Gold Answer identifies 'difficulty breathing' as one of the 'additional distinct symptoms' that specifically raised the COVID-19 concern. The Gold Answer limits the general infection list to 'fevers, fatigue, and muscle aches'.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer captures the primary symptoms listed in the D-36 turn. It misses the more nuanced observations in the Gold Answer regarding the omission of taste/smell from the doctor's summary and the patient's own expressed worry, which provide context to the 'clinical assessment' requested in the prompt.",
    "faithfulness": "All symptoms listed (fevers, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough) are directly grounded in the source transcript, specifically turn D-36. There are no hallucinations.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer directly addresses the prompt's two-part question using the appropriate section of the transcript."
