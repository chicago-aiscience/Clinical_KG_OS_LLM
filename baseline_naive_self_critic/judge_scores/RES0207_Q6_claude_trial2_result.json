  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer claims the transcript ends at P-26 and provides no information about next steps. However, the Source Transcript clearly continues through D-38, with D-37 and D-38 explicitly outlining next steps. The Generated Answer directly contradicts the available information and is factually incorrect.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer covers 0% of the key points from the Gold Answer. It fails to mention: (1) consultation with another doctor, (2) collaborative decision-making, (3) returning shortly to discuss next steps, (4) possibility of tests, (5) developing a management plan, or (6) patient acknowledgment. Instead, it incorrectly claims the information is unavailable.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer is not faithful to the transcript. It falsely claims the transcript ends at P-26, when the Source Transcript clearly shows continuation through P-37 and D-38. The claim that 'There are no doctor responses following [P-26]' is demonstrably false based on the provided transcript which includes D-27 through D-38.",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer does not address the question at all. Instead of identifying next steps, decision-makers, and follow-up actions from the consultation's conclusion, it incorrectly claims this information is unavailable. This is completely irrelevant to what was actually asked."

  "summary": "The Generated Answer is entirely incorrect and receives the lowest possible scores across all dimensions. It falsely claims the transcript ends at P-26 and that no next steps were communicated, when the Source Transcript clearly continues through D-38 with explicit discussion of next steps in D-37 and D-38. This represents a complete failure to extract information that is plainly present in the source material. The answer provides no useful information and actively misinforms by claiming relevant content does not exist."
