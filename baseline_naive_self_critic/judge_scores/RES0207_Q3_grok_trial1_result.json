  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer correctly identifies the patient's recognition of the causal link via the accurate quote from P-9 and references to P-8 and P-23, aligning with the Gold Answer's core facts on the connection and patient's attribution. Minor discrepancies include stating missed dose definitively 'causes a seizure' based on a non-existent 'knowledge graph and clinical notes' (hallucinated source), whereas Gold emphasizes patient's recognition without clinician confirmation and specifies timing/context from P-24. Core facts on patient's statements are consistent.",
    "completeness": "Gold key points: missed Keppra dose same night as seizure due to disrupted routine [P-8, P-24]; P-9 quote attributing causality voluntarily after D-9; rarity of seizures [P-9]; one-time lapse from birthday [P-24]; no clinician confirmation. Generated covers: general causal connection, P-9 quote, P-8 seizure mention, P-23 Keppra ID. Misses: specific timing/same night, P-24 details on why missed, voluntary context re D-9, rarity implication, lack of clinician confirmation. Covers ~60% of key points (main P-9 evidence but lacks supporting details).",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: P-9 quote exact, P-8/P-23 accurate from transcript. 'Frequency linked to adherence' plausible from P-9 context but interpretive. Hallucination: 'knowledge graph and clinical notes' not in transcript/input; implies external source. No other fabrications, mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses question: explains connection (missed dose precipitates seizure) and patient's recognition (explicit P-9 quote with context), no off-topic content."
