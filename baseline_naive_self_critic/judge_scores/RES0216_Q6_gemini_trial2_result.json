  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The generated answer correctly identifies asthma as the top differential and cardiac ischemia as a lower differential. However, it incorrectly states that the patient should use their 'existing' rescue puffers. The transcript (P-17, P-18) clearly states the patient does not have any currently and hasn't refilled the prescription. It also confusingly labels cardiac ischemia as a 'primary differential' while simultaneously saying it is lower on the list.",
    "completeness": "The generated answer covers most key points: the assessment, the physical exam (listening to lungs), the therapeutic trial of rescue puffers, and the contingency plan. It misses the detail mentioned in the Gold Answer regarding the clinician's plan to consult with 'the doc' (supervising physician) before finalizing the plan.",
    "faithfulness": "The claim that the patient should use 'existing' puffers is unfaithful to the transcript, as the patient explicitly mentions they ran out and didn't refill them years ago. The rest of the claims are grounded in the dialogue.",
    "relevance": "The generated answer is highly relevant, directly following the structure requested by the prompt and addressing each specific component of the question (assessment, exam, treatment, contingency)."
