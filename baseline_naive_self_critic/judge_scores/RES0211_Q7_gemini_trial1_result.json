  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer contains major factual errors. It claims the transcript does not state the order of symptoms, but in [P-4] the patient explicitly says her throat was scratchy first, then she started coughing. It also claims there is no mention of the patient feeling hot, which is directly contradicted by [P-7], [P-9], and the doctor's summary in [D-58].",
    "completeness": "The answer fails to cover any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the specific symptom sequence (throat then cough), the systemic symptoms like headache and malaise, and the description of the 'feeling hot' sensation (constant, day and night).",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer exhibits significant negative hallucinations. It states that clinical information is missing from the transcript when that information is clearly and repeatedly provided by the patient.",
    "relevance": "The answer attempts to address the prompt's structure but fails to provide any relevant information because it incorrectly asserts that the data is unavailable in the source text. It is largely unhelpful to the user's query as a result of its inaccuracies. This is the only dimension not at 1 because it stayed on topic but gave incorrect info about that topic's availability in the text. This is more of a 2 because it is factually incorrect but relevant to the request. Let's make it 1 as well given the total failure of the response. Actually, a 1 is best for this because it did not address the question correctly at all. "
