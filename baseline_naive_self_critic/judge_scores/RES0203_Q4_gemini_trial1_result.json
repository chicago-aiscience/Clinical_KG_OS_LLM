  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "The Generated Answer is factually incorrect and directly contradicts the provided transcript. It claims that 'no negative findings' were documented and that the doctor 'did not screen' for fever, dyspnea, or sore throat. However, the transcript explicitly shows the doctor screening for fever (D-10), difficulty breathing/dyspnea (D-11), sore throat (D-13), and many other symptoms, all of which the patient confirmed were absent.",
    "completeness": "The Generated Answer fails to include any of the key points from the Gold Answer. It misses the entire list of negative findings (fever, breathing issues, headaches, sore throat, chills, night sweats, muscle aches, chest pain, sputum, triggers, medical history, etc.) and consequently fails to explain how their absence informed the clinical picture.",
    "faithfulness": "The Generated Answer contains significant hallucinations. It claims the doctor did not discuss or evaluate these symptoms, which is demonstrably false based on the dialogue in the transcript (D-10 through D-15, D-21 through D-27).",
    "relevance": "The Generated Answer fails to address the specific requirements of the prompt. Instead of listing negative findings as requested, it incorrectly asserts they do not exist and instead provides a list of positive findings, which was not the focus of the question."
