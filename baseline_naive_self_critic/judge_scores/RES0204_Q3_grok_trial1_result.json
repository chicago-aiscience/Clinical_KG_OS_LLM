  "reasoning": {
    "correctness": "Generated Answer accurately captures the core rationales for chest X-ray (persistent cough, D-37) and COVID swab (standard protocol for these symptoms, D-39), matching Gold's key points. Minor discrepancies include omitting runny nose as a present symptom, not listing all pertinent negatives (e.g., sore throat, taste/smell explicitly), and adding external 'clinical knowledge' not in Gold or transcript. Patient absences like no fever/chills are noted but attributed partially inaccurately (e.g., SOB/wheezing from P-28). Overall, core facts consistent with minor issues.",
    "completeness": "Covers: persistent cough 4-5 days not improving (P-2, P-7); some absences (no fever/chills P-13, no chest pain, SOB/wheezing P-28); chest X-ray rationale (D-37); COVID protocol (D-39). Missed: clear runny nose (P-11-12), full list of negatives (sore throat P-9, taste/smell P-10, muscle pain P-14, headaches P-18, nausea P-16-17), no sick contacts P-19/22, no travel P-20, family asthma hx P-28, novelty of dry cough P-24, explicit tie to absent high-acuity markers prompting imaging. Covers ~60% of Gold key points.",
    "faithfulness": "Claims mostly verifiable: cough duration/improvement P-2/P-7, X-ray quote D-37, COVID protocol D-39, some absences P-13/P-28. Minor issues: misattributes X-ray explanation to D-39 (actually D-38); adds 'clinical knowledge' on cough warranting X-ray (hallucinated); interpretive claims like 'not life-threatening or asthma exacerbation, proceed with screening vs emergency' plausible but not directly in transcript. Some unverifiable details but mostly grounded.",
    "relevance": "Directly addresses how findings led to orders: separates rationales for X-ray (cough) and swab (protocol), notes role of absent severe findings in opting for diagnostics over emergency care. Minor tangent with external clinical knowledge; fully focused on question without off-topic content."
