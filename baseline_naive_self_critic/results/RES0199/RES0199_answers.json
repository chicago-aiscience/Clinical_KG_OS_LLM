In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound OK?\n[P-1] Patient: Hi I just came in today I have been having, just been feeling really sick over the last three or four days. It started with just like a headache and cough four days ago and then I started getting some nausea and vomiting few days back as well as diarrhea.\n[P-3] Patient: It's been pretty persistent. Besides, when I take some Tylenol.\n[P-12] Patient: It's mostly a dry cough.\n[P-24] Patient: Uhm smell I feel like a little bit. I've been kind of losing my smell over the last I would say one day.\n\nQuestion: How did this patient's illness develop over the four-day course, specifying which symptoms appeared first, when the gastrointestinal symptoms and loss of smell began relative to the initial symptoms, and how the headache and cough changed or remained stable in severity over time?\n\nAnswer:",
