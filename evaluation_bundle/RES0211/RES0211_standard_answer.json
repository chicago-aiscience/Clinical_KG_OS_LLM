    "question": "What specific symptoms did Jessica report experiencing over the past three to four days, and which symptoms did she explicitly deny when the doctor asked about them (e.g., sputum production, nausea, joint pain, rashes)?",
    "gold_answer": "Jessica reported a three-to-four-day history [P-1, P-3] of the following symptoms: a dry cough and scratchy throat [P-1, P-4], a pounding headache with an active headache at the visit [P-1, P-2], feeling 'really hot' persistently both day and night, even wearing minimal clothing like shorts and a tank top [P-7, P-9], feeling 'crappy overall' and 'icky' [P-1, P-2, P-14], which the doctor formally characterized as 'malaise' [D-15], and feeling tired [P-13]. Regarding explicitly denied symptoms: Jessica denied sputum or phlegm production [P-5, P-6], denied noticing new skin changes or rashes [P-10], denied nausea and vomiting [P-11], denied diarrhea [P-12], denied joint aches [P-13], noting only tiredness, and denied feeling like she cannot breathe from her allergies [P-18]."

    "question": "What medications is Jessica currently taking or carrying with her, and what additional treatments has she received in the past from her allergist? Include the specific names, indications, and dosing details mentioned in the conversation.",
    "gold_answer": "Jessica is currently taking two medications. First, she carries Claritin for seasonal allergies but is not actively taking it since her allergy season has not yet started; she has it 'just in case' [P-16, P-25]. Second, she takes 'Deyo,' an oral contraceptive pill that 'goes for three months' [P-25, P-26, P-27], which the doctor confirmed is an oral contraceptive pill rather than an IUD [D-28, P-28]. She explicitly denied any medication allergies [D-16, P-16]. Regarding past treatments from her allergist, Jessica reports having received allergy shots in some years, typically administered 'once a week for a little while, like in the winter before' allergy season [P-16, P-20]. She confirmed she does not carry an EpiPen [P-21], explaining her allergies are 'just like the seasonal ones' and do not cause facial swelling or breathing difficulty [P-18, P-21]."

    "id": "Q3",
    "type": "diagnostic_reasoning",
    "question": "How do Jessica's presenting symptoms of dry cough, subjective fever, scratchy throat, and headache, combined with the absence of sputum production, gastrointestinal symptoms, and joint pain, support the doctor's assessment of an upper respiratory infection?",
    "gold_answer": "Jessica's symptom constellation is consistent with a typical upper respiratory infection (URI). Her initial scratchy throat [P-4] followed by a dry cough [P-1, P-4], subjective fever with persistent feeling of being hot day and night [P-7, P-9], pounding headache [P-1, P-2], general malaise [P-14, characterized as such in D-15], and fatigue [P-13] developed over three to four days [P-1, P-3], a typical URI timeline. The dry, non-productive cough with no sputum or phlegm [P-5, P-6] suggests upper airway irritation rather than a productive lower respiratory process. Denial of nausea, vomiting [P-11], and diarrhea [P-12] helps distinguish her illness from gastrointestinal involvement. Absence of joint pain [P-13] further narrows the presentation. Additionally, her brother had a cold a few weeks prior [P-39], suggesting a plausible household viral exposure. The doctor summarized her illness as a dry cough with fever and headache and framed next steps accordingly [D-58]."

    "question": "What specific conditions did the doctor systematically screen for through targeted questioning (such as asthma, eczema, allergic reactions requiring an EpiPen, and night sweats), and what were Jessica's responses that helped narrow the differential diagnosis?",
    "gold_answer": "The doctor systematically screened for several conditions. For night sweats, the doctor asked about waking with soaked sheets [D-9]; Jessica reported feeling hot constantly but did not confirm drenching night sweats [P-9]. For productive cough, the doctor asked about bringing anything up and phlegm [D-5, D-6]; Jessica denied sputum production [P-5, P-6]. For severe allergic reactions, the doctor asked whether allergies cause breathing difficulty or facial swelling [D-18]; Jessica reported only mild stuffiness and post-nasal drip [P-18, P-19]. The doctor confirmed she does not carry an EpiPen [D-21, P-21]. For personal asthma, Jessica denied ever having it [D-29, P-29]. For family history of asthma, only a cousin has it [P-30]; parents and siblings are unaffected [P-31]. For eczema in the family, Jessica denied it [D-32, D-33, P-33], noting only her father shares her seasonal allergies. The doctor also screened for rashes or skin changes [D-10; denied P-10], GI symptoms [D-11, D-12; denied P-11, P-12], and joint pain [D-13; denied P-13]."

    "id": "Q5",

    "question": "How do Jessica's family history of allergies in her father and asthma in her cousin, her brother's recent cold a few weeks prior, and her household living situation on a farm with home-schooling during COVID collectively relate to her current upper respiratory symptoms?",
    "gold_answer": "Several factors contextualize Jessica's presentation. Her father has the same seasonal allergies [P-33], and a cousin has asthma [P-30], establishing a family history of allergic and respiratory conditions. However, Jessica notes her allergy season has not started yet [P-16, P-17], suggesting this episode differs from her typical allergic symptoms. Her brother had a cold a few weeks ago [P-39], which the doctor summarized as approximately two weeks prior [D-58], representing the most plausible viral exposure source. The family lives on a farm outside London [P-43, P-44], and Jessica is doing school from home during COVID [P-41]. Her mother works from home and her father works on the farm [P-42], and Jessica confirmed she 'doesn't really leave the house' [P-45] and denied recent travel [P-45, P-46]. This relatively isolated environment suggests intra-household transmission from her brother's cold as the most likely exposure. The doctor confirmed there is only a dog on the property, not a working animal farm [P-48], reducing concerns about animal-related exposures."

    "type": "clinical_plan",
    "question": "In the doctor's summary at the end of the visit, what key clinical findings did the doctor recap for Jessica, and what did Jessica identify as her primary goal for the appointment in terms of next steps?",
    "gold_answer": "In D-58, the doctor provided a structured summary recapping: (1) a three-to-four-day duration of a dry cough with a little bit of fever and some headache; (2) that Jessica has not been bringing anything up with the cough (no sputum production); (3) that no one in recent close contact has been sick, except her little brother who had a common cold about two weeks ago; (4) that she does not have asthma; and (5) that she is not taking any medications aside from Claritin. The doctor framed the visit's purpose as determining 'next steps and where to go from here' and checked that this matched Jessica's goals. In P-60, Jessica identified her primary goal: she wants to know 'if I have to like take medicine or something' to address her symptoms. In P-61, she also expressed a desire to go home soon and lay down, reflecting the impact of her malaise and fatigue on her daily functioning and underscoring her immediate priority for symptom relief and rest."

    "type": "temporal_progression",
    "question": "In what order did Jessica's symptoms first appear and progress over the three to four days before her visit, starting from the initial symptom she noticed, and how did her sensation of feeling hot relate to the timeline of her cough and throat symptoms?",
    "gold_answer": "Jessica's symptoms progressed over three to four days [P-1, P-3]. When asked what she first noticed [D-4], she stated the initial symptom was a scratchy throat, which was then followed by the onset of a dry cough [P-4]. By the time of the visit, she also reported a pounding headache [P-1] with a milder active headache confirmed during the appointment [P-2], general malaise and feeling 'crappy overall' [P-1, P-14], and fatigue [P-13]. Regarding the sensation of feeling hot, Jessica described it as persistent and constant, occurring 'all the time,' both day and night [P-7, P-9]. She mentioned wearing only shorts and a tank top and still feeling hot [P-9]. The transcript does not specify the exact day the feeling of heat began relative to the throat and cough onset; it is established as part of the same multi-day illness. The doctor later summarized it as 'a little bit of fever' during the episode [D-58]. The overall progression moved from localized upper airway irritation (scratchy throat, dry cough) to broader systemic symptoms (subjective fever, headache, malaise)."
