    "question": "What specific characteristics of the 26-year-old patient's chest pain are described in the consultation, including the quality, duration of episodes, and the situations in which the pain tends to occur versus resolve?",
    "gold_answer": "The 26-year-old patient presents with chest discomfort lasting approximately one and a half weeks [P-2, D-3]. The patient initially describes the sensation as not exactly pain but rather something 'very uncomfortable' and 'odd' [P-2], though later clarifies it is a 'very sharp, strong pain' occurring specifically when taking a deep breath [P-3]. Episodes last roughly 20 minutes each and recur intermittently throughout the day, coming on 'here and there' rather than remaining constant [P-6, P-7, D-7, D-9]. The pain tends to occur when the patient is alone -- specifically while walking to school or sitting and studying alone [P-4, P-29]. Notably, the pain tends to resolve or go unnoticed when engaged with other people, such as talking to classmates, working on hands-on tasks, or doing other activities at school [P-9, P-29]. The doctor confirms the pain can occur at rest [D-11, P-11]. The patient denies worsening with exercise, noting walking to school 'stays the same' and having not done strenuous exercise recently due to schoolwork [P-10]. No preceding injury or accident is reported [P-5], and the pain had no prior occurrence before this episode [P-17]."

    "question": "What over-the-counter medications and supplements did the patient report taking, both to treat the chest pain and as part of their regular routine, and how effective were the pain-relief attempts?",
    "gold_answer": "The patient reported trying three over-the-counter remedies for the chest pain: Tylenol, Advil, and Alka-Seltzer [P-6]. The patient explicitly states these haven't 'really helped very much,' indicating all three were ineffective at relieving symptoms [P-6]. In addition to these pain-relief attempts, the patient reports taking a daily multivitamin as part of a regular routine, which is the only ongoing supplement [P-25]. When the doctor asks about current medications, the patient confirms taking no prescription medications -- only the multivitamin [D-25, P-25]. While not a medication, the patient mentioned usually managing stress through leisure reading at night and running a few times a week, but has been 'a little bit nervous' to run lately [P-28]. The patient is also currently trying to quit smoking, having reduced from about 10 cigarettes per day to approximately 5, though finding it 'kind of hard' [P-13, P-14, P-18]."

  {
    "id": "Q3",
    "type": "diagnostic_reasoning",
    "question": "Considering that the patient's chest pain occurs predominantly when alone (walking to school or studying by herself) and tends to resolve when she is distracted or engaged with other people, and given her history of anxiety attacks as a teenager and current heightened academic stress, what diagnosis do these combined findings point toward, and which specific clinical observations from the consultation support this reasoning?",
    "gold_answer": "These combined findings strongly point toward anxiety-related or stress-induced chest pain. Several observations support this. First, the situational pattern: pain occurs when the patient is 'alone kind of with my thoughts' -- walking to school or studying -- and resolves when distracted by social interaction, working with classmates, or hands-on tasks [P-4, P-9, P-29]. Second, the patient has a history of anxiety attacks as a teenager discussed with a family doctor, though untreated for about eight years, and acknowledges they 'could maybe' return [P-21, P-22]. Third, the patient is under significant stress from a Masters thesis deadline and time pressure, which is explicitly linked to symptoms [P-13, P-15, P-16]. Fourth, during episodes the patient 'makes herself nervous' and 'starts breathing faster,' though denies intrinsic breathing difficulty, and notes 'it's hard to get a deep breath' because of nervousness [P-19]. Fifth, the patient considers stress as a possible cause [P-8]. Sixth, pertinent negatives support this over cardiac or pulmonary pathology: no fevers [P-12], no exertional worsening [P-10], pain occurs at rest [D-11, P-11], no palpitations outside anxiety episodes [P-20], and no asthma [P-23, P-24]."

    "type": "ruled_out",
    "question": "What conditions did the doctor specifically ask about or screen for during the consultation that were effectively ruled out based on the patient's responses, and what questions or lines of inquiry did the doctor use to exclude each one?",
    "gold_answer": "The doctor systematically screened for several conditions. (1) Traumatic/musculoskeletal injury: Asked about 'accidents or injuries' [D-5]; denied [P-5]. (2) Cardiac disease including exertional angina: Inquired about exertional worsening [D-10]; denied [P-10], palpitations or heart fluttering [D-20]; denied except during past anxiety episodes [P-20], and confirmed pain occurs at rest [D-11, P-11], arguing against typical angina. (3) Infectious/febrile illness: Asked about fevers and being 'sick at all' [D-12]; denied, felt well aside from stress [P-12, P-13]. Also asked if anyone around the patient had been sick [D-27]; denied, noting living alone [P-27]. (4) Asthma: Asked about childhood asthma [D-23]; denied [P-23] and current asthma [D-24]; denied [P-24]. (5) Primary dyspnea: Asked 'do you ever feel short of breath?' [D-19]; patient clarified breathing faster when nervous but no baseline breathing difficulty [P-19]. (6) Inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndromes: Asked about unexplained sudden deaths in young family members or deaths 'while swimming' [D-31]; denied [P-31] and about arrhythmias [D-32]; denied [P-32]."

    "id": "Q5",
    "type": "risk_factors",
    "question": "How do the patient's family history of early cardiac events (father's heart attack in his 50s), her personal smoking history, and her current psychosocial stressors each contribute to and interact with her concern about heart disease, and what details from the consultation illustrate these connections?",
    "gold_answer": "The patient's concern about heart disease is driven by three converging factors. First, family history: the father had a heart attack 'last year' while 'pretty young' in his 50s and now sees 'a lot of heart doctors' [P-8, P-30]. The patient explicitly states this 'scares' her and worries it could be a 'heart thing' [P-8]. The paternal grandfather died young in an accident, so cardiac history beyond the father is unknown [P-30]. Second, smoking as a concern: the patient began around age 18, escalated to about 10 cigarettes per day for two years, and recently cut down to approximately 5 per day while finding quitting 'kind of hard' amid school demands [P-13, P-14, P-18]. Third, psychosocial stressors: finishing a Masters in social work under intense thesis deadline pressure [P-15, P-16], living alone in London [P-26, P-27], and being nervous about running lately [P-28]. The patient connects these factors -- acknowledging the pain might be stress-related but uncertain [P-8], becoming nervous during episodes and breathing faster [P-19], and noting anxiety attacks from teenage years may be returning [P-22]."

    "id": "Q6",
    "type": "clinical_plan",
    "question": "Based on the doctor's concluding remarks, what was the stated plan at the end of this consultation, and what key clinical information had the doctor gathered throughout the interview to inform the next steps in the patient's care?",
    "gold_answer": "In [D-33], the doctor states: 'I think I've got all the information I need and I'll pass it on to the doctor who'll take a look at you.' This indicates a history-taking or triage encounter, with the plan to relay findings to another physician for further evaluation. No investigations, prescriptions, or diagnoses were communicated. Key information gathered includes: (1) symptom characteristics -- sharp chest pain for one and a half weeks, 20-minute episodes at rest, especially when alone, relieved by distraction, worsened with deep breaths but not with exercise [P-2, P-3, P-6, P-9, P-10, P-29]; (2) failed OTC treatments with Tylenol, Advil, and Alka-Seltzer [P-6]; (3) pertinent negatives -- no trauma [P-5], no fevers [P-12], no asthma [P-23, P-24], no baseline dyspnea though anxiety-related faster breathing [P-19], no palpitations outside anxiety [P-20], no family sudden death or arrhythmias [P-31, P-32]; (4) relevant history -- teenage anxiety attacks untreated for eight years [P-21, P-22], smoking approximately 5 cigarettes per day down from 10 [P-14, P-18], father's heart attack in his 50s [P-8, P-30]; and (5) psychosocial context -- Masters thesis stress [P-15, P-16], living alone [P-27], multivitamin only [P-25]."

    "type": "temporal_progression",
    "question": "Trace the timeline of the patient's relevant history as described in the consultation, starting from when she began smoking, through her previous anxiety attacks as a teenager, to the escalation of academic stress in recent weeks and the onset of chest pain approximately a week and a half ago. How did each phase relate to the next?",
    "gold_answer": "The timeline begins around age 18, when the patient started smoking occasionally [P-18]. During the teenage years, overlapping with early smoking, the patient experienced anxiety attacks and discussed them with a family doctor [P-21]. Then approximately eight years passed without significant anxiety symptoms [P-22]. Over the past two years (roughly ages 24-26), smoking escalated to about 10 cigarettes per day [P-18]. A few months ago, the patient began cutting down to approximately 5 per day while finding quitting difficult amid school demands [P-14, P-18]. Around this period, the father had a heart attack in his 50s, instilling fear about cardiac disease [P-8, P-30]. The patient is now finishing a Masters in social work; over the 'last couple of weeks,' stress intensified due to a 'time crunch' to finish the thesis [P-15, P-16]. Approximately one and a half weeks ago, chest pain first appeared -- a symptom never experienced before [P-2, P-3, P-17]. The patient acknowledges stress as a possible cause [P-8], notes anxiety attacks may be returning [P-22], and describes episodes as more noticeable when alone and less so when distracted [P-9, P-29]."
